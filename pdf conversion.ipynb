       "['A meeting of the Federal Open Market Comittee was held in the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington on Tuesday, May 29, 1962, at 10:00 a.m. PRESENT: Mr.  Martin, Chairman 1/ Mr.  Hayes, Vice Chairman Mr.  Balderston Mr.  Bryan Mr.  Deming Mr.  Ellis Mr.  Fulton Mr.  King Mr.  Mills Mr.  Mitchell Mr.  Robertson Mr. Shepardson Messrs. Bopp, Scanlon, Clay, and Irons, Alternate Members of the Federal Open Market Committee Messrs.

Eastburn, Ratchford, Baughman, Jones, Tow, Coldwell, and Einzig, Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, respectively Mr. Sternlight, Manager, Securities Department, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Mr. Hellweg, Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Upon motion duly made and seconded, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on April 17, 1962, were approved. Before this meeting there had been distributed to the members of the Committee a report on open market operations in United States Government securities covering the period May 8 through May 23, 1962, and a supplementary report covering the period May 24 through May 28, 1962. Copies of both reports have been placed in the files of the Committee. In supplementation of the written reports, Mr. Stone commented as follows: Among the more noteworthy developments as viewed from the Trading Desk since the last meeting of the Committee is the fact that while the banking system has had continuously available a volume of free reserves that is within the range of other recent periods, there has occurred, behind that volume of free reserves, a considerably more comfortable money market situation and a perceptible slowing of the rate of growth of total reserves. The evident implication is that the economy has been making less vigorous use of available free reserves than in April, for example, and, in the past week or two, less vigorous use than one might expect on seasonal grounds. A part of the explanation of this 5/29/62 situation, as we see it from the vantage point of the Desk, lies in the sharp reductions in dealer positions and use of credit since late April and early May, but whether and to what extent the explanation for the less vigorous use of available reserves in the recent period goes beyond the decline in dealer financing requirements is difficult to determine. In any event, with Federal funds largely in a 2 - 2-3/4 per cent range, the reserves have clearly been available in ample volume. Mr. Holland, in his broader review of the credit situation, may have somewhat more perspective on these matters. Given this new situation, rates on Treasury bills moved lower during the early part of the period, but turned upward when the Treasury announced that it would add $100 million to the bill supply in the auction held last week (and when it subsequently announced that another $100 million would be added to the bills sold in yesterday\\'s auction). Demand for bills has been good throughout the period, and the general tendency has been toward lower rates. Yesterday, partly in response to the easy money market that developed, the rate moved lower again. The three-month bills were sold at an average of 2.66 per cent, while the six-month issue was sold at an average of 2.74 per cent. These rates are down 4 or 5 basis points from the preceding auction but are close to the rates set in the auction two weeks ago. If the economy does not use the reserves available to it any more vigorously than in the recent period, then assuming free reserves in about the recent range, bill rates could well drop somewhat further even if the Treasury continues to add $100 million to the supply of bills for the next two or three weeks. If, on the other hand, the economy should use up reserves at the rate it did in April, short-term rates could well tend to move upward. Prices of Treasury bonds in the period since the last meeting were up, then down during much of the period, and finally up again in the past several days. The rise at the beginning of the period was more or less a continuation of the upward movement that had started about three months ago, when the market seemed to decide that neither economic trends nor developments in credit policy would put upward pressure on longer-term rates for the time being -- and that the balance of forces on rates might even be downward. The rise in prices gained further impetus from the steady erosion of stock market prices. Then, from about May 14 through 21, bond prices fell off and in some cases lost perhaps a third of the gains recorded over the previous two and a half months. 5/29/62 -4 Better news about the economy, the approaching payment date for the May refunding, and sporadic advances in the stock market all helped to produce a much more cautious attitude among dealers -- who still held large amounts of the refunding issues and sizable inventories of other issues as well. While there was no heavy selling by investors, the limited offerings that did appear were not readily absorbed--and in fact dealers sought instead to lighten their inventories of intermediate and longer issues at every opportunity. A second turnabout in the price trend came around May 21-22 as fresh buying was stimulated by the more attractice yield levels than attained, and by the new rush of price declines in the stock market, while dealers\\' inventories had by this time worked down to a considerably lower level. Throughout the period it was evident that the stock market was a major factor influencing the prices of Treasury securities--both as a psychological factor and as a direct influence as some funds reportedly moved out of equities and into fixed-income securities. The stock market\\'s influence was particularly noteworthy yesterday, when the bond market started out with small price declines, and then turned around as selling pressures mounted in the equity market. Finally, I might comment on the question raised by Mr. Swan at the last meeting of the Committee, with regard to the recent use of repurchase agreements. We discussed this matter informally after the last meeting and it might be useful to summarize here the substance of that discussion. You may recall that Mr. Swan asked two questions--first, whether the recent use of repurchase agreements went somewhat beyond the rationale originally envisaged when the repurchase instrument was adopted; and second, whether the recent use of repurchase agreements had a tendency to cause reserve levels to turn out somewhat lower than anticipated because of dealers\\' action at times in terminating these agreements before maturity. On the first point I think the answer is \"yes\"; it seems to us that a somewhat more extensive use of repurchase agreements has been part of the process of adapting System open market operations so as to be able to inject reserves while minimizing direct downward pressure on bill rates. As to the second question, it does not seem to us that the employment of repurchase agreements has tended to produce significant shortfalls from anticipated reserve levels. We know when we arrange these agreements that they may be withdrawn by dealers prior to maturity, and some rough allowance can be made for this. Partly for this reason, shortfalls from anticipated reserve levels owing to dealer withdrawals of repurchase agreements 5/29/62 -5 have been very small relative to shortfalls resulting from the erratic behavior of market factors. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, the open market transactions in Government securities during the period May 8 through May 28, 1962, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. Mr. Noyes presented the following statement with respect to economic developments: At one time or another in recent months almost every analyst of economic developments has found occasion to express some doubts as to the sustainability of the level of stock prices. In many of the forecasts for 1962 made at the close of last year, a major break in equity prices was mentioned as one of the disturbing possibilities. At the first of the year, and several times thereafter, it seemed that such a major adjustment might be under way, but until mid-March each was reversed after a short drop. Since March 15, however, prices have been declining, with only minor interruptions and growing momentum, until at the close yesterday the Standard and Poor\\'s average at 55.50 was off 24 per cent from the December high. The fact that the adjustment was so widely heralded does not seem to have substantially reduced either the dismay or the pain of its reality. There can be little doubt that a decline of these proportions must be reckoned as a major factor in any appraisal of economic developments. While the effects should not be exaggerated, they have already spread well beyond the narrow confines of the market itself. Whether it should be or not, a drop this large will be interpreted by many as a harbinger of recession. It will almost certainly result in some curtailment in investment expenditures and perhaps dampen consumer spending as well, especially for luxury-type goods and services. The stock price decline has proceeded in the face of quite a bit of relatively favorable news with respect to the performance of the economy. Production in April was up a little more, if anything, than we estimated at the time of the last meeting. Indications are for some slight further gain in May, despite the curtailed rate of steel production. Retail sales were up about as anticipated last month, and both department store and auto sales continued strong through the first three weeks of May. Neither our own buying intentions survey taken in mid-April or the current information 5/29/62 -6 received from other surveys provides evidence of slackened consumer confidence or a cutback in consumer spending plans. In fact, the surveys, taken together, would suggest some pick-up in demand for household durable goods, an area which has lagged thus far in the recovery and expansion. Housing starts were up further last month, and house purchase plans reported in the survey also showed some improvement. Consumer credit growth in April is now estimated at almost half a billion dollars--up somewhat more than the early figures on retail trade would have indicated, and considerably above the previous high for this recovery period. While developments have not taken on any of the character istics of a boom, one would have had to have rather high hopes to find the performances of the economy so far in the current quarter disappointing with respect to current sales, output, and employment. But, apart from the stock market, there has been evidence of concern and even pessimism regarding the economic outlook. Information reported by the National Association of Purchasing Agents with respect to their plans and policies has taken a very pessimistic turn. Observers who rely heavily on the National Bureau of Economic Research leading indicators have found, especially in certain combinations of these statistics, configurations which lead them to suspect that a downturn may not lie too far ahead. The behavior of manufacturers\\' new orders for durable goods--which declined for two months and showed no improvement in April--has been disappointing to some. While they are not as specific and articulate as one might wish as to their reasons, businessmen in a variety of lines report dissatisfaction and concern--and this feeling on their part is an economic fact which must be taken into account, along with the data. Even before the dramatic further decline in the market yesterday, it seemed clear that quite a fundamental reappraisal of the economy\\'s performance and prospects, especially as to profits, was under way. It is hard to think of any construc tive change in policy that the monetary authority might take while this reappraisal is in process. The continuation of a policy aimed at the objectives expressed in the current directive would seem most appropriate. Mr. Furth presented the following statement on the U. S. balance of payments and related matters: In April and May, balance of payments developments were midly encouraging. For the first quarter, official balance of 5/29/62 -7 payments data showed a monthly deficit of $150 million. But the figure based on net transfers to foreigners of gold, con vertible foreign currencies, and dollars would be around $200 million. The Board\\'s staff believes that the latter figure is better comparable with current data. The deficit for April was $200 million, about the same as the first quarter average but much less than the figure for March alone. Tentative and partial data for the first three weeks of May indicate further improvement this month. Net gold sales to foreigners amounted to a monthly average of $100 million in the first quarter and to $120 million in April, but to only $60 million in May. Our net sales for this month were reduced by some gold purchases, mainly from Canada. Economic activity abroad remains satisfactory in the developed countries but mixed in underdeveloped areas. Output in the United Kingdom seems to be expanding; the country\\'s balance of payments appears to be in equilibrium, with a rise in exports apparently to a large extent offsetting the decline in the inflow of capital funds. Concern has been expressed, however, about pressures for wage increases in excess of amounts deemed compatible with the maintenance of price stability. Similar concern is prevalent in Continental Europe although the continuing rise in the reserves of the main European countries makes anxiety about the competitiveness of European industry appear premature, to say the least. The Gilpatric agreement with Germany on military expenditures and agreements with Italy and France on debt prepayments will temporarily reduce both the European surplus and the U. S. deficit, but the prepayments will not correct the underlying situation. Continuing financial, economic, and political troubles in many Latin American countries will probably put a double burden on our balance of payments and on our domestic economy: they will hamper our exports to those countries, and at the same time increase pressures for additional government aid. Gold and foreign exchange markets were quiet until a few days ago. Since last week, however, the markets have been nervous, with unfavorable effects on the dollar. Some of the reasons were technical: the continuing concern about the future of the Canadian dollar has apparently led to the withdrawal of European funds from Canada; and since the U. S. dollar is in variably used as \"vehicle currency\" in these transactions, the movement has strengthened the U. S. dollar vis-a-vis the Canadian dollar but weakened it vis-a-vis the European cur rencies. Similarly, the apparent cessation of capital flows 5/29/62 -8 from the Continent to Britain has strengthened the dollar against sterling but contributed to dollar weakness on the Continent. But there have also been rumors about withdrawals of European funds from the New York stock market. If such with drawals became substantial, they would weaken not only the dollar rate but also our balance of payments. Whatever the reason, the dollar is again close to the floor against all major Continental European currencies ex cept the German mark. It has improved against sterling, although still remaining below par. It has risen substantially above par against the Canadian dollar, but this is scant comfort. Even the London gold market, which had been a bright spot in the international financial picture in recent months, has been disappointing. The price has again risen above $35.08, and the Bank of England had to sell some gold to the market. In absolute terms, all these movements have not been very impressive. When seen in context with developments on the stock exchange, however, they may be taken as another symptom of disturbed investor confidence and the resulting general market uneasiness. Mr. Holland presented the following statement with respect to credit developments: Banking and credit changes during the past three weeks have been pushed into the background by the eye-catching developments in the central financial markets. Mr. Noyes has already com mented on the dramatic decline in the stock market. The municipal market has also been under some pressure, with yields backing up somewhat as dealers worked to move sizable new offerings in the face of a record total of inventories on the Blue List. Meanwhile, the Government securities market has been the focus of conflicting influences. For a time during May, it appeared the market yield curve was destined to lose some of the flatness it had acquired during 1962, as downward market pressures on the bill rate were followed by upward pressures on yields extending from the intermediate through the long end of the Government list. Such pressures were countered in varying degrees by System and Treasury actions to bolster the bill rate and by the strength imparted to the debt markets by sinking stock prices. As a consequence, the month of May drew towards its close with a yield curve in the Government market not far dif ferent from that at the beginning of the month, despite some 5/29/62 -9 tendency for other short rates to move lower and long-term municipal yields to move higher. Now, however, a combination of resurgent investor demands and the temporary reserve surpluses of the current week are applying new downward pressures particularly on the bill market, and it remains to be seen how much bill yields will be displaced by this convergence of factors. During this span, the banking system has continued to add to its loans, although in a somewhat altered pattern. In the first half of May, loan growth in the smaller urban and rural areas appeared to slow, while loan increases at city banks were stronger. In part, the increases in loans at city banks repre sented temporary or one-time influences, such as the short-run financing of enlarged dealer positions around the Treasury financing and the taking into portfolio of almost all the $300 million participation certificates sold by the Export-Import Bank. Underlying these changes, however, were some further increases in real estate, consumer, and business loans. Among the cyclically strategic industries, only construction has accounted for an important part of the business loan increases of recent weeks. Loans to construction firms by leading banks have been moving up briskly since March, paralleling the pickup in building activity. Bank holdings of securities appeared little changed on balance during the past four weeks. This resulted in less total bank credit expansion than had been reported for some previous months or for the comparable period of last year. Bank holdings of municipal securities declined a little for seasonal reasons, due chiefly to the maturity of some New York City tax notes. Even after allowing for that factor, however, the more gradually mounting figures reported for recent weeks suggest some waning in bank appetites for more municipals, at least at the yield levels prevailing during April and much of May. Turning to the deposit side of bank balance sheets, reports indicate a slower rate of increase in time deposits, a pause in expansion of demand deposits, and a large shift of demand balances from private to Government hands. As a result, the average money supply in the first half of May is estimated to have slipped about $100 million following its billion dollar April increase, and a larger reduction is possible in the second half of this month. At its mid-May mark, the money supply stood 2.8 per cent above its year-ago level. Available data suggest a continuing increase in the rate of money use. Turnover of demand accounts in reporting centers outside New York reached an annual rate of 31.8 in April. Thus far during 1962, deposit turnover so measured has averaged 8 per cent above a year ago. 5/29/62 -10 Reflecting these deposit movements, the total of reserves required against private deposits declined substantially more than seasonally during the first three reserve weeks in May. The level reached in the week of May 23 was equivalent to a 3 per cent annual rate of growth in such reserves from last November. Furthermore, the full amount of that increase in aggregate re serves over the past six months was more than taken up by the growth in reserves required against time deposits; reserves required against private demand deposits were actually below their November level on a seasonally adjusted basis. The May contraction in the private reserve base substanti ally offset the April increase, despite the fact that free reserves were maintained during the month at an average level substantially unchanged from April. In fact, free reserves in this week and last are relatively high compared with typical 1962 levels. Such a pattern calls attention to the fluctuating nature of private deposit totals, and warns against the imputa tion of significance to the movements in individual weeks except as they can be seen as parts of a developing pattern. Dis tortations or concentrations of deposit movements can be created by the erratic timing of many bank loan and investment deci sions, a particular case in point being securities loans. Another major contributor to private deposit fluctuations--and a key factor recently--is the change in Federal Government accounts. Treasury balances dropped to unusually low levels through April, and then rose probably to a record average level in May. They are likely to persist at a relatively high level during much of June. Such movements have thus served, first to expand, and more recently to contract, private money holdings for appreciable spans of time. Shifts of deposits into Treasury accounts during May also led to some concentrations of reserves in the major money centers. This movement may provide a partial explanation of the development of easier money markets along with more or less stable free reserve figures, and perhaps also may have influenced the appearance of stronger city bank loan ex pansion along with a slackened pace of expansion in outlying areas. The conduct of System operations in the weeks immediately ahead will continue to be complicated by such Treasury influ ences, above and beyond the more predictable reserve impacts of a heavy currency drain over the next statement week and the usual early-month trough and midmonth bulge in float. An appropriate policy to guide such operations must take into account many con siderations, some of which lie outside the scope of this review. With slackened bank credit expansion, a contracting money supply, and unsettled conditions in key financial markets, however, any move toward more restrictive general monetary conditions than prevailed during the earlier weeks in May would appear out of step. 5/29/62 _11- Chairman Martin, who had been attending a meeting at the White House, entered the room at this point. Mr. Hayes presented the following statement of his views with respect to the business outlook and monetary policy: I would like to preface my remarks by stating that I wish our meeting were not occurring only one day after yesterday\\'s momentous happenings, as the visibility this morning is certainly low. How ever, I have in mind the fact that we must set policy for three weeks ahead, and hopefully the atmosphere may be very much less hazy a week or two weeks hence. It therefore seems appropriate to consider what might be done if and when the dust clears. Most business statistics in April were rather satisfactory and indicative of a continuing gradual rise in business activity. Retail sales and housing starts were particularly encouraging. With personal income continuing upward, the foundation is being laid for further gains in consumer spending. As for business spending, the outlook is clouded by the possibility of reper cussions of the steel price episode on business attitudes. A clear line on capital spending plans subsequent to the steel episode must wait on the Commerce-SEC survey, which will become avail able in June. Inventory accumulation in the current quarter will be far below that of the first quarter, primarily because of the situation of the steel industry. One major uncertainty is the effect on spending of the sharp drop in stock prices. While experience in the past few months does not show any clear effect of lower stock prices on consumer or business spending, there is no doubt that the market decline reflects an undercurrent of distrust, both here and abroad, that could act as a check on the current expansion. A more optimistic interpretation might construe much of the stock price drop as an adjustment to a noninflationary environment; but even if the decline stemmed from this worthwhile reason it could nonetheless generate some highly undesirable effects of its own. Commodity prices continue to exhibit marked stability, especially at the wholesale level. Regardless of the expected improvement in business, it seems increasingly doubtful that unemployment can be reduced to the so-called \"tolerable level\" of 4 per cent even a year from now. Credit demands have been quite moderate, and there has been a good balance between the supply of, and the demand for, credit and capital. The loan officers and economists of major 5/29/62 -12- New York City banks are still concerned over the failure of loan demand to develop as expected earlier, and they do not look for much change in the immediate future. Clearly, most banks throughout the country are in a comfortable position to meet all legitimate credit requests. It might even be contended that they have been enjoying an excessive degree of liquidity which has tended to put undue downward pressure on short-, medium-, and long-term yields. Since the heavy seasonal Treas ury deficit in prospect for the second half of the calendar year will necessarily be financed in good measure by the banks, the latter will experience a significant increase in liquidity as a consequence of this development. As for nonbank liquidity, while it is always very difficult to judge its adequacy on the basis of the various statistical measures available, I have a general impression that it is relatively comfortable at the present time. The balance of payments outlook remains unsatisfactory. Although the over-all deficit in April improved somewhat over the high March figure, it remained above the first quarter average, after adjustment has been made for the French advance debt repayment last month. Merchandise exports seem to have been weakening significantly, and there has been an increase in long-term borrowing in this market by foreigners. While we should not give too much weight to any single month, the fact remains that the balance of payments for the year to date shows a disappointing lack of improvement over a year ago. During the past week the dollar has been under some pressure in the exchange markets, partly because of nervousness as to possible protective measures that might be adopted by the United States. With foreign dollar holdings continuing to increase, there is reason to look for declines in the gold stock over the coming weeks. Some months ago the hope was expressed in our meetings that a \"natural\" increase in interest rates accompanying further cyclical business expansion might help to dampen the outward flow of capital from this country. However, recent business and credit developments do not point to the likelihood of such a tendency in the near future. Monetary policy continues to face a dilemma with respect to the emphasis that should be placed on domestic and international considerations, and the dilemma is perhaps becoming more acute as the balance of payments deficit continues in the face of a rather slow rate of domestic business expansion. I am aware that most of the Committee members have been ex ceedingly reluctant to consider any deliberate tightening of credit conditions in view of the domestic situation, and the severity of the stock market break would naturally strengthen this reluctance. 5/29/62 -13 I have considerable sympathy with this view; nevertheless, I be lieve that if and when the stock market shows signs of bottoming out and stabilizing we might probe in the direction of somewhat less ease, with the hope of encouraging the 90-day bill rate to hold closer to 3 per cent than to 2-3/4 per cent, a Federal funds rate consistently close to the discount rate, and some pressure on the banks\\' bill portfolios. The liquidity of the economy seems ample to give some leeway for such probing. Although only experience can disclose what this might mean in terms of free reserves, it seems to me likely that these objectives could probably be achieved with free reserves in the $300 to $400 million range. I would stress that what I have in mind is cautious ex perimentation, with close attention being paid to any possible adverse effects of such probing on the continued expansion of bank credit and bank deposit. Incidentally, I have in mind that even keel considerations may be with us again shortly after the next meeting. With respect to bill rates, it seems to me that we have been leaning rather too heavily on the Treasury\\'s debt management policies ( i.e., adding to the weekly bill issues) to keep these rates at acceptable levels, especially in view of the fact that the Treasury must do a great deal of cash financing in the next six months. I would repeat that any probing towards less ease should be undertaken only if the stock market regains some measure of composure. With respect to the directive, I had thought that one of the reasons behind our change in procedure a few months ago was to provide for greater flexibility, i.e., to avoid a tendency to con tinue in effect for months on end a directive which was very general in character. The present directive has remained unchanged since March. I suggest that we amend it today to indicate the current economic situation (including particularly the stock market break), the ample liquidity situation, and the need for some slight shift in emphasis in view of our serious balance of payments problem. More broadly, I am wondering more and more whether the current \"mix\" of monetary policy and fiscal policy is the best that could be devised to meet the combination of internal and external problems which we face. I am interested to observe that the possibility of a tax reduction as a means of stimulating the economy is apparently receiving study. Success ful action along these lines would of course give monetary policy greater leeway to exercise a dampening influence on the outward capital flow. Mr. Bryan said he had left for this meeting prepared to say that the business situation seemed to be developing in such manner, both 5/29/62 -14 nationally and in the Sixth District, as to suggest some lowering of the Committee\\' s free reserve target and the establishment of a lower growth rate than he had heretofore been advocating in regard to total reserves. However, after the events of yesterday, he could not advocate any monetary policy except one of continued ease. Mr. Noyes had spoken well, he thought, of the influence of the equity market break on consumption and on investment. The stock market developments could affect millions of people who did not hold a single equity security and simply read about the matter in the press. As to investment, it was the policy of many corporations to try to maintain a certain proportion between their debt and equity instru ments. Where such corporations had been contemplating equity financing, they would now be reluctant in many cases to go forward. In addition, he was afraid that the stock market break was going to have a reaction that would not be helpful to the banking situation. He would imagine that many banks had gotten under way studies of their loans, and that their standards of lending were going to be raised. That would be particularly true, he believed, in the case of banks that had over the past three or four years piled up a substantial volume of demand loans secured by high-grade equity and debt instruments. While such loans might actually be demand loans in New York, and to a lesser extent in Chicago, in the outlying banks of the country they were long-term capital loans on which neither the borrower nor the lender expected repayment to be made, the funds being used by the borrower for long-term capital commitments. 5/29/62 -15 In such circumstances, Mr. Bryan repeated, he was not prepared to advocate any change in monetary policy. It seemed to him that the Com mittee must continue to supply reserves in seasonal amounts, plus some modest growth factor, say 3 per cent. Mr. Bopp reported that the Third District was experiencing the same kind of gradual business upswing as the nation, although as usual there was a tendency for the District to lag behind the United States. Such up to the minute data as were available indicated no general accelera tion in the upswing. In banking, on the other hand, the picture was quite different. Business loans in the District, unlike the nation as a whole, had been experiencing a sharp pick-up. The increase was widely based among almost all industrial categories. Reserve positions were comfortable, borrowing from the Reserve Bank was negligible, and reserve city banks were still net sellers of Federal funds, although in smaller amount. If it were not for the balance of payments problem, Mr. Bopp said, he would like to see an easier monetary policy, especially after the developments in the stock market yesterday. Although policy to date had been successful in promoting a high degree of liquidity in the banking system and the economy and had helped to keep long-term rates from rising, it was probably true that still greater ease could further stimulate the rather sluggish demand which, at least in part, was behind the current relatively moderate rate of economic expansion. The question had been, 5/29/62 -16 and remained of course, whether further ease could accomplish enough domestically to warrant possible further aggravation of the balance of payments situation. He was inclined to doubt it. In view of the possi bility that the balance of payments might worsen during the course of the year, substantial further ease could well be too great a risk. Accordingly, Mr. Bopp said, he would be inclined to continue monetary policy essentially unchanged, especially in view of the stimulat ing effect likely to ensue from a rising budget deficit. At the same time, he would also like to see the Desk continue to probe in the direction of lower long-term rates by purchasing intermediate- and long-term issues when appropriate and selling short terms if necessary to accomplish this. He would continue about the same degree of ease in reserves, maintain the present directive, and leave the discount rate unchanged. Mr. Fulton reported that, except for the retail sales sector, economic activity in the Fourth District had worsened considerably in recent weeks, trends in unemployment, electric power output, and steel production having been unfavorable. Auto sales had been maintained in the three major cities of the District at a vigorous rate, and it began to look like a 7 million car year, including about 350,000 imports. Reports for May on department store sales showed them expanding to a new high. For the year to date, such sales were up 4 per cent from a year ago. However, the unemployment picture had shifted into the unfavorable category in May. Contraseasonal layoffs had occurred, concentrated largely in the steel 5/29/62 -17 areas. Unemployment was up three per cent in the District from late April to mid-May. As to the steel industry, Mr. Fulton described the current picture as dismal, with no pick-up in orders and ingot production continuing to drop. Steel users, including the automobile industry, still had substantial inventories. Construction was in good volume in the major cities of the District, which provided a bright spot. Turning to the banking picture, Mr. Fulton said that commercial and industrial loans had dipped. In the three weeks ended May 23, they declined by the largest amount of any week since January 3 of this year. Demand deposits adjusted were down sharply, while savings deposits continued to increase. As to monetary policy, Mr. Fulton expressed the view that the System had done about all it could in terms of the domestic economy. The System had consistently supplied reserves in quantity; it had met all of the seasonal factors and had provided an additional factor for growth. Credit had been readily available, but was not used by businesses. It appeared to him that international considerations predominated at present and that free reserves might well be reduced. Thus, he would go along with a range of $300 $400 million in lieu of figures over $400 million. Also, while re cognizing that the margin requirement instrument was not within the province of the Open Market Committee, he felt that a reduction in 5/29/62 -18 margin requirements might be considered. Confidence had been shaken, to put it mildly. Likewise, the international situation involved a confidence factor. Some confidence might be restored, in his opinion, by a reduction of margin requirements and by a firming of interest rates through making fewer reserves available. Mr. Fulton said that he would not recommend changing the discount rate at this time. He would have no objection to renewing the present policy directive, although it might be changed somewhat to reflect existing economic circumstances more precisely. Mr. King said he thought it had been fairly generally agreed that a stock market correction would necessarily come about at some point. The concern he had today was that the ramifications of the stock market decline not spread further than necessary. He did not believe that the System could control or stop the stock market slide, but it should do whatever was possible to allow natural forces to bring about a cessation of the decline. Mr. King went on to say that he thought the Open Market Committee had contributed to the defense of the dollar by doing what it could to maintain the bill rate. The Treasury, of course, had done a great deal through measures such as adding to the supply of bills. Three or four months ago, however, he (Mr. King) had spoken to this point and said that he thought the Federal Reserve should cease its efforts to maintain the bill rate within a particular range. 5/29/62 -19 The more the System tried to hold short-term rates in this manner, the more he felt that the stock market decline was likely to continue. With that thought in mind, he would suggest that there be deleted from the policy directive the reference to minimizing sustained downward pressures on short-term rates. A time might come when the bill rate level could no longer be maintained, and in his opinion it was better to cease the effort before that time came, although he would not advocate that the System and the Treasury pursue different objectives. At one time, he recalled, he had been a leading proponent of maintaining the bill rate, and he thought this had served a desirable purpose. He was surprised that it had been possible to keep the bill rate in its present range for so long. However, he felt that the time was coming when this would no longer be possible. Mr. Mitchell said it was his general feeling that present System policy was about the best that could be devised at this particular time. He did not see that there was any change that would be particularly helpful. If there was to be a move in either direction, he would think that a slight easing would be preferable. On the other hand, the reverberations of stock market developments seemed likely to make this country\\'s balance of payments position somewhat more serious than it had been. The psychological reverberations about which the Committee had been worrying might come into play. On 5/29/62 -20 the domestic side, there would be, unquestionably, some reaction on consumer spending, particularly for hard goods, if the stock market continued weak and prices declined further. All in all, this was a bad day to make policy decisions. Under those circumstances, it would seem best to wait and make no change for the moment. Mr. Shepardson spoke of having attended yesterday a meeting of representatives of institutional lenders to agriculture, at which there were reports of a continuing rise in farm land prices. The drop in land prices in the corn belt area had been completely recovered, and prices in other areas were continuing to move upward. Most institutional lenders represented at the meeting reported a rise in farm mortgage lending. Several insurance companies, finding inadequate outlets for their funds elsewhere, were providing their farm departments with increased allocations of funds. Concessions were being made on rates. Some country bank representatives mentioned that while their construction loans, particularly residential, had not shown much increase as yet, they had all made heavy advance commitments and had been delayed in putting out the money, only because of weather conditions. Mr. Shepardson also reported that at yesterday\\'s meeting there was discussion of the foreign trade situation and the potential effect 5/29/62 -21 of the European Conon Market agreements on agricultural exports from the United States. Question was raised as to whether farm land prices were not being pushed out of reason, considering the prospects for crop prices. All of this, Mr. Shepardson said, strengthened the feeling he had had for some time that perhaps the System had accomplished all it could do through monetary policy and that it should be drawing back a little, at least on the rate of growth of reserves. He had spoken at previous Committee meetings in favor of reducing the annual rate of growth of total reserves to 3 per cent, or even lower, and he had felt surer of that position after attending the meeting yesterday. However, when he learned of the gyrations in the stock market, he felt much like Mr. Hayes, that no perceptible change in policy should be made at this time. Nevertheless, as soon as the situation cleared somewhat, he believed that a careful look should be taken at the amount of funds available in the market to appraise whether the System was going to aid the domestic situation by continuing to supply reserves so liberally since corrections in the domestic situa tion might well have to come from other factors. The System should study whether the uncertainties generated by the stock market situation and their impact on the balance of payments situation did not call more than ever for a position of less ease as soon as the visibility improved. In summary, his position was similar to that expressed by Mr. Hayes. 5/29/62 -22 Mr. Robertson expressed the view that the Committee should refrain at this time from being panicked into any action that might develop to be unfortunate. This was the time when an organization like the Federal Reserve System ought to stand out as an example for the nation. It should hold as steady as possible. Mr. Mills commented that if a loss of public faith in the stability of financial conditions was being experienced, the thing needed to restore confidence was the injection of some degree of discipline into the financial markets under the leadership of the Federal Reserve System. Unhappily, in the light of the circumstances in the stock market, he believed, like others who had spoken, that any overt change in policy at the present time would be misunder stood and would be more disturbing than tranquilizing. However, every opportunity should be taken by the System to inject some discipline into what he considered a very soft and weak monetary and credit policy situation. To elaborate on his thinking, Mr. Mills presented the following statement: Over many months past, repeated opportunities have opened up for changing the direction of Federal Reserve System monetary and credit policy toward moderately less ease, but have been rejected by the Federal Open Market Committee. The last three meetings of the Committee offered two practical openings for a policy change, while the intervening third meeting prevented the possibility of any overt move because of impending U. S. Treasury financing and the consequent need of maintaining a relatively unchanged policy position. 5/29/62 -23- The spreading weakness in the stock market that culminated in panic conditions and a collapse of prices on May 28 has thrown up a new obstacle against a change in monetary and credit policy, in that Federal Reserve System policies are a vital part and influence in the entire complex of the factors that comprise the entire financial market, and it would be unwise at this juncture to make any immediate policy change, for to do so could further unsettle financial market conditions. A calm and undisturbed Federal Reserve System policy posture is called for at the present time. However, the need for a revised policy that will produce a firmer interest rate structure is as pressing as ever, and the first opportunity for its achievement should be seized upon. The ambivalent efforts that have been made to hold up the yields on U. S. Treasury bills as a deterrent to the movement of gold and U. S. dollars abroad at the same time that the main burden of Federal Reserve System policy actions has been on the side of credit ease have resulted in pegging U. S. Treasury bill yields. In the eyes of operators in the U. S. Government securities market, the Federal Reserve System\\'s monetary and credit policy objectives have come increasingly into a kind of disrepute, which has had by-product effects on the markets for municipal and cor poration fixed interest obligations, which are becoming progressively unsettled. In formulating Federal Reserve System monetary and credit policy, a paramount need exists for returning as quickly as possible to a free market concept, by virtue of which the interest rate structure will be freed from artificial manipulations and will develop naturally out of the uninhibited influence of the supply and demand for the use of funds available to the market. In the interval before the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee any opportunity for a revision in monetary and credit policy should be exploited, even to the extent of calling a special meeting of the Committee for that purpose. By the same token, a special meeting of the Committee should be called to deal with any kind of emergency in the U. S. Government securities market that might develop in the event that the serious conditions in the stock market should be commnicated to other investment areas and react in unusually heavy drains on our gold reserves. Mr. Wayne reported that business activity in the Fifth District had continued to improve in recent weeks, probably at a somewhat faster 5/29/62 -24 pace than in the country as a whole. April gains in nonfarm employ ment and factory man-hours were quite general, and unemployment had steadily declined. The Reserve Bank\\'s latest canvass of District business leaders suggested that most of the April increases con tinued into May. Durable goods manufacturing had probably not advanced beyond the good levels reached in April except in the furniture industry, which continued to show significant improvement. Reports from the textile industry presented a rather neutral picture, but respondents covering the nondrable goods group as a whole indicated that new orders, shipments, and employment had recently achieved further gains. On the other hand, coal orders and ship ments had declined in recent weeks, causing some layoffs, reduced workweeks, and small price cuts. Regarding general business prospects, about three-fourths of the respondents to the Bank\\'s periodic surveys had regularly expected either no change or only slight improvement since the first of the year. Turning to the policy field, Mr. Wayne noted that for many months the Committee had been faced by a conflict between the require ments of the domestic and the international sectors of the economy. In recent weeks both sectors had been marked by increased uncertainty about the near future. Falling stock prices had been both a reflection and a cause of this uneasiness. The sharp decline in the trade balance 5/29/62 -25 for March was a contributing factor in the international sector, while an the domestic side a cautious attitude was reflected by declining forward purchase commitments by business firms, a slow drop in orders for machinery and equipment, a sluggish rise in capital outlays, and wholesale prices that were slightly on the weak side. The international situation was clearly delicate and potentially dangerous. Beyond what was already being done, however, he did not believe that monetary policy could make any significant contribution toward its improvement short of some comprehensive and drastic move which would have to be aimed at raising long-term as well as short-term interest rates. Such a move was not warranted by the domestic situation and, he believed, would be highly undesirable. Further, he did not believe that any small increase in short-term rates would have any significant effect on the balance of payments. On the domestic side, perhaps the greatest contribution the Committee could make would be to insure that no fear of any credit squeeze was added to the other uncertainties which were developing. For that reason, he believed that the Committee should continue to make available a supply of reserves sufficient to maintain a condition of moderate ease, as it had been doing for a number of weeks. He would favor renewing the current directive and leaving the discount rate 5/29/62 -26 Mr. Clay commented that although domestic economic develop ments had continued to show improvement in recent weeks, the pattern had been by no means uniform. It still was correct to characterize aggregate economic activity as less than vigorous. Moreover, the basic fact remained that the economy had a long distance to go in order to attain a satisfactory rate of utilization of manpower and other resources. Under the circumstances, he felt that the domestic economy continued to call for monetary policy to be expansionary with a view to fostering a higher level of economic activity. This would be reflected in a further growth of bank credit on a seasonally adjusted basis and further downward movement in interest rates. For some time, Mr. Clay noted, the Committee had endeavored to affect favorably the international flow of funds by the general level at which it had maintained the Treasury bill rate. This action had pointed up the conflict between the Committee\\'s current domestic and international objectives. The open market operations required to maintain the Treasury bill rate at a higher level than it otherwise would have been had tended to be restrictive in nature. The Committee had sought to avoid or reduce this effect by making purchases in other sectors of the Government securities market. At the last meeting of the Committee, Mr. Clay recalled, it had been suggested that the relative level of interest rates in 5/29/62 -27 international markets throughout the maturity structure should be considered henceforth in formulating monetary policy. More specifically, the view advanced looked with favor upon a higher level of interest rates in the United States throughout the maturity range, so that these rates would be higher relative to rates in foreign markets. Clearly, this approach to the problem would involve a more restrictive monetary policy, which in his opinion would jeopardize the improvements in the domestic economy resulting from the expansionary policy that had been pursued. Moreover, there was a real question whether the increase in interest rates necessary to affect materially the international flow of funds would not be of such magnitude as to be severely restrictive in terms of monetary policy and its impact on the domestic economy. At a time when the performance of the domestic economy was far from satisfactory, Mr. Clay thought that the question was whether monetary policy should not be directed toward providing more instead of less stimulus to the pace of activity. Certainly, as he saw it, no action should be taken to foster higher intermediate- and long term interest rates; the downward trend of recent months had been salutary and should be encouraged to continue. The Treasury bill rate might be maintained within the same range as it had been for some months, with offsetting open market operations as necessary in 5/29/62 -28 order to maintain reserve availability. No change was recoended in the Federal Reserve Bank discount rate, and he felt that the directive could well be renewed in its present form. Mr. Scanlon reported that in general business activity in the Seventh District appeared to be following the national pattern. However, home building in most District centers was below a year ago, in contrast to the strong national picture. It appeared to him, Mr. Scanlon continued, that during the past several weeks there had been a marked difference in the attitude of consumers and the attitude of businessmen. According to the indications of recent surveys, the consumer\\'s confidence in his financial well-being had improved, and he was no more interested in buying automobiles and other durable goods. (Of course, the behavior of the stock market in the past few days might have changed the survey indications somewhat.) As to businessmen, many of them had expressed disappointment despite the facts reported on items such as employment, the work-week, construction, and housing starts, all of which were highly encouraging. The consumer appeared to be acting on a more favorable evaluation of the economic situation. In the Seventh District, department store sales during the four weeks after Easter were 12 per cent above a year ago, compared to a rise of 10 per cent nationally. Auto sales during the first 20 5/29/62 -29 days of May maintained the advanced April level. Reflecting the trend of sales, auto assemblies during the past three weeks were at an annual rate of 8 million, the highest since December. However, estimates of Detroit sources were still based on sales of 6.8 to 7 million cars this year, including imports. Mr. Scanlon also reported that local manufacturing output in major centers, based purely on use of electric power, showed gains in the most recent month reported, the increases from a year ago ranging from 16 to 18 per cent. Steel output had declined about 30 per cent from the March level in the District as well as nationally, and some further decline was still in prospect. Order trends were being evaluated somewhat less favorably than three weeks ago. Employment reports were moderately encouraging; unemployment compensation claims were below the levels of the past two years. Housing contracts were down 9 per cent from a year ago, compared with a rise of 18 per cent nationally. Only in Indianapolis was an increase reported. Mortgage terms in Chicago had eased only slightly since the first of the year. As to banking developments, Mr. Scanlon reported that business loan demand was relatively strong, although not as strong as the bankers would desire. From the end of January until the middle 5/29/62 -30 of May, business loans had risen at a rate twice as fast as nationally. Chicago banks had regained a modest surplus reserve position since the middle of April, and the larger banks had been sellers of Federal funds. Between the middle of April and the middle of May, the banks reduced their bill holdings and purchased other securities. Turning to policy, Mr. Scanlon commented that although most business news had been favorable during the past several weeks, demands on resources continued to be moderate. Wholesale price increases were at least balanced by price declines. One must necessarily take into account the possibility of the further development of adverse business sentiment due to the stock market, along with some dis satisfaction regarding order and profit trends. In his view, current monetary policy should be continued until the next meeting of the Committee, and he would not recommend a change in the discount rate at this time. The current policy directive might be continued unless the Committee wanted to give some recognition to the current stock market situation. If changes were made, he would like to see the phrase \"short-term\" eliminated from the final clause of the directive, which called for taking account of the desirability of avoiding downward pressures on short-term interest rates. Mr, Deming reported that the most notable Ninth District economic development in the past three weeks had been a dramatic turnaround in crop prospects for 1962. From the first of April through 5/19/62 -31 the middle of May there had been little rain, but since then there had been a great deal of rain, and everyone was now optimistic. Otherwise, the District was continuing pretty much along the lines indicated at previous Committee meetings. As to the coming three weeks, Mr. Deming expressed agreement with those who believed that monetary policy should not be changed. By that, he meant that there should be no change quite explicitly in terms of most of the significant guides. For example, he would not like to see the free reserve level change significantly even though the maintenance of that level might result in lower bill rates and a somewhat easier money market than had been sought in the past three weeks. In other words, he would like ot see the indicators that were watched by the public maintained without change, and he had same feeling that the Committee ought to say this in the current policy directive. For example, the first paragraph of the directive might be changed to read somewhat as follows: \"In view of the continuing modest advance of economic activity and the continued underutilization of resources, and in light of recent stock market developments, but with continued recognition of the adverse balance of payments situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to continue in a posture essentially unchanged from that of recent weeks.\" Such changes in the first paragraph would reflect the Committee\\'s awareness of stock market developments in the past 5/29/62 -32 three weeks, and he thought this would be desirable from the stand point of the record. He would recommend no change in the discount rate at this time. Mr. Swan reported that the Twelfth District, like the nation, showed some further, but very moderate improvement in the business situation in April. According to scattered indicators, the same trend continued into early May. There had been a slight reduction in the rate of unemployment, the seasonally adjusted rate having fallen from 5.8 per cent in March to 5.7 per cent in April. Lumber markets in the District had firmed somewhat as new orders exceeded production, and western steel production had declined much less than the decline for the country as a whole. In the three weeks ended May 16, District weekly reporting banks reflected gains in loans, including a marked increase in real estate loans. As a general statement, there did not appear to be any very significant differences between the District situation and the over-all picture for the country. In terms of policy, Mr. Swan said it seemed to him that the Committee should maintain much the same position that it had maintained quite recently. Since the economic upswing certainly was not vigorous and further uncertainties had been introduced by stock market develop ments, he did not think that any significant change in policy would be desirable. Like Mr. Deming, he felt that a continuation of policy without change should be related to the free reserve level, which for 5/29/62 -33 the immediate future should be held about where it had been, that is, $450 million or thereabouts. If this meant some decline in the bill rate below 2-3/4 per cent, no attempt should be made to offset that decline by a significant reduction in free reserves. As to the current policy directive, Mr. Swan concurred with the view of Mr. Hayes that it was not desirable to have the directive remain unchanged for a lengthy period, particularly in light of current developments. Therefore, he would like to see those developments recognized in the first paragraph. In the second paragraph, he was bothered by the phrase that called for avoiding sustained downward pressures on short-term rates. While there could be different inter pretations of the word \"sustained,\" it might be argued that any reduction below 2-3/4 per cent in the bill rate would be regarded as reflecting sustained pressure. Accordingly, he would favor eliminating that particular phrase. He would not recommend changing the discount rate at this time. Mr. Irons reported that economic activity in the Eleventh District was proceeding favorably. There was strength in the employment picture, with total nonagricultural employment moving to a near record and unemployment, on an unadjusted basis, falling to about 4.3 per cent of the labor force. The trend of consumer demand was favorable. Industrial output was up, and construction was up sharply. Except for some developing dryness, which was not a great problem, the agricultural situation was quite good. In summary, 5/29/62 -34 economic activity was proceeding at a moderate upward pace. Mr. Irons also said that Eleventh District banks seemed to be adequately liquid. There had been increased loan demand in the past three weeks, especially for business and construction loans, with a reduction in investments. Demand deposits were off a bit, and savings deposits were up a little. The growth of savings deposits was slowing down. There seemed to be little change in the demand for Federal funds, with purchases running at an average of about $500 million and sales about $450 million. Except for some small amount of seasonal borrowing, there was little activity at the discount window. Turning to policy, Mr. Irons commented that when he left Dallas for this meeting he had in mind some tentative conclusions. It seemed to him that the System had done about as much in the way of supplying reserves as would be appropriate under the circumstances, and he leaned toward a somewhat less generous approach to the providing of reserves, even though that might result in some firming of interest rates. However, the events of the past few days had changed his line of reasoning. The economic statistics looked quite good, but attitudes, the confidence factor, and related matters were less favorable and the developments in the stock market could not be ignored. Accord ingly, he concluded that this was a good time to maintain the status quo, while reexamining the System\\'s position, evaluating the consequences 5/29/62 -35 of what was going on in the stock market, and appraising them atter of business confidence. Perhaps another look should be taken at economic trends to see whether any factors were developing of which the Comittee had not been aware. In particular, he would want to watch consumer reaction--and also the international reaction--to the recent stock market developments. There were a lot of unanswered questions that were being brought to the fore by the finacial market changes. Thus, the situation seemed to call for study of possible consequences rather than for action at this moment. In summary, Mr. Irons said, his views were much the same as those expressed by Mr. Robertson. He would maintain the status quo as nearly as possible and avoid overt action of aknti yn d this time. He would not change the discount rate or the current policy directive. Mr. Ellis reported that NEenwg land business conditions had shown continued modest improvement since the previous meeting of the Committee. No sector of the economy showed signs of disturbing weak ness, and no sector showeds igns of unsustainable expansion. Most manufacturing industrsiteresn gthened in April, andm an-hour data suggested a rise in the index of production. Nonmanufacturing employment seemed to haveb een a little weaker in April than seasonal expectations. Mr. Ellis also reported that First District reporting banks found business ljdoueamsnat nd aboutm eeting seasonal expectations. 5/29/62 -36 Total loans and investments continued to grow at a good pace. The growth of deposits was holding loan-deposit ratios fairly stable. District banks had been fairly heavy net sellers of Federal funds in the past five weeks. Turning to policy, Mr. Ellis commented that he, like so others, had left for this meeting prepared to urge a change in the policy guidelines. After the stock market events of yesterday, however, he had shifted to a position of no change in policy at this time. As to what no change in policy might mean, he noted that there are several anchors of policy, among them free reserves, avoidance of sustained downward pressures on short-term rates, and concern with finacial markets in general. The question was to which anchors of policy the Committee desired to cling most strongly in the next few weeks. According to the projections, the System was going to have to inject several hundred million dollars of reserves in the next two weeks. Hew ould urge that they not be injected in a way that would promote further pressure on short-term rates, for he would not want to give up the objective of avoiding that kind of pressure. His definition of noc hange in policy would be no chage from the weeks in April rather than the most recent three-week period, which was characterized by greater ease in the money market centers, traceable perhaps in some degree to Treasury operations. 5/29/62 -37 Mr. Ellis said that he would like to see the Committee recognize changes in the economic situation in the first paragraph of the current policy directive. One of the purposes of instituting the present procedure was to be able to recognize such changes, and he felt that the Committee\\'s record of understanding and evaluating the situation it was attempting to meet would read better if there was some recogntion of the changes that had occurred since March. The language suggested by Mr. Deming would go some way in that direction. Mr. Deming, however, had omitted the phrase that called for promoting further expansion of bank credit and the money supply. He (Mr. Ellis) would like to see that phrase retained, but to have the word \"promote\" changed to \"permit,\" as suggested by Mr. Shepardson at the May 8 meeting. Mr. Balderston said that he would advocate holding just as steady as possible. However, he was impressed by the reasons for changing the wording of the current policy directive. His suggestion would be to eliminate the second paragraph and change the first paragraph somewhat as follows: In view of the continued under utilization of resources, the modest rate of domestic expansion, and the recent sharp decline in stock market prices, the Federal Open Market Committee is continuing its policy of promoting the ex pansion of bank credit and the money supply. 5/29/62 -38 In discussion of his proposal, Mr. Balderston said the sharp decline in stock market prices, along with the results that might flow therefrom, constituted the principal reason why he would continuepr esent policy. Otherwise, he migbhet  inclined to veer toward less ease. His proposed directive wouldm ake no reference to the international situation because he had a feeling that the Committee had been \"driving on both sides of the road long enough\" and as a result its directives were not clear. He would drop the second paragraph of the present directive because it seemd to him that it was redundant, Mr. Francis commented that Eighth District business conditions continued to improve to about the same extent as indicated by many of the other District reports that had been given. Chairman Martin noted from a news ticker report that had been brought to him that stock market prices had experienced another substantial decline this morning. He went on to say that before this meeting he had attended a meeting at the White House with the President and other officials of the Administration. He felt constrained to say to the Committee that the President throught[sic] the Federal Reserve System, like the rest of the Government, had an obligation in this matter. Against this background, he told the President that the Board of Governors had discussed yesterday the question of margin requirements, at which time the Board members 5/29/62 -39 were of the view that \"steady in the boat\" was the proper course. The President\\'s position was that the Federal Reserve should follow whatever course it thought would be most helpful; he raised the question whether, if the Board was not going to change the margin requirements, it would be desirable for the Board to say that it was not going to change them. He (Chairman Martin) left with the President, as a matter of general information, a paper on the pros and cons of a margin requirement change that had been prepared by the Board\\'s staff. Chairman Martin said he had made no commitment other than to bring to this meeting of the Committee the President\\'s view that this was a serious situation. The President had left to the discretion of the Federal Reserve the question whether any action should be taken by the System, indicating that the System ought to do whatever it considered wisest in the present circumstances. If it was the view of the Federal Reserve that it would be better not to issue any statement, that was for the System to decide. If, on the other hand, there was a feeling that the System should make a statement, the President would be glad to have such a statement made. The Chairman then read from a news ticker report the answers that had been given this morning by Secretary of the Treasury Dillon 5/29/62 -40 to questions raised by reporters. Mr. Dillon reportedly attributed to the White House conferees a feeling that stock prices had been on the high side and had now dropped to a level more in keeping with price-earnings ratios. Mr. Dillon stressed that the Govern ment had no controls directly affecting stock market prices. He also pointed out that margin requirements were a matter within the sole discretion of the Board of Governors. Mr. Dillon urged speedy Congressional action on the proposal to allow tax credit to businesses on purchases of equipment. He did not feel that the stock market developments reflected any decline in confidence outside the stock market. He noted that stock prices had already started on a down ward trend before the steel price episode. Chairman Martin then said that he would like to indicate to the Committee his own thinking on monetary policy, which was much along the lines that some members of the Committee had expressed prior to the recent stock market decline. Its view was, in essence, that the System had gone as far as it should with a policy of easy money and that such a policy had outlived its usefulness. This did not mean, however, that the System should take any overt action at this particular time. On the basis of his recent visit abroad and the views expressed by people with whom he had been talking recently, he felt there was something more fundamental in the stock 5/29/62 -4l market situation than easy money. Unquestionably, however, the developments in the market reflected the backwash of speculation in a wholesale manner that had been going on all around the country. The margin requirements, he thought, had been reasonably effective in controlling the amount of credit going into speculation in stocks, but they had not affected real estate and other speculative activities. Therefore, he was inclined to feel that easy money was part of the total picture; he doubted very much whether it could be said that easy money had nothing to do with the situation. While he felt that the Federal Reserve had been thoroughly justified in the course it had been pursuing, the System could not just go along thinking that easy money was going to produce an exuberant economy. Continuing, Chairman Martin said that he would like to reiterate a view he had expressed a number of times before, namely, that the balance of payments problem overshadowed everything else. He would not want to say that this was the crisis he had referred to several times as a possibility, but the situation conceivably could develop such proportions. As to policy for the immediate future, the Chairman said it was his feeling, on the basis of the discussion at this meeting, that the wisest course would be to stay steady in the boat and make no change in policy of any sort at this moment, but rather to continue 5/29/62 -42 to evaluate the problem Whethert here should be a change in the current policy directive along the lines that had been suggested or whether it would be wiser to renew the directive in its present form was open to debate . However, it seemed that the majority wcselaensa tirmlye nt foric nh ange no policy at this particular time. Chairman Martin inquired whether there were any questions about the accuracy of his statement of the consensus as to policy for the immediate future, and no such question was indicated. There followed, however, consideration of the wording of the current economic policy directive in light of the several suggestions that had been made, and it was the prevailing view that some reference to recent developments in the stock market should appropriately be incorporated in order to place on record that this was a factor recognized by the Committee in shaping its policy for the forthcoming period. Certain other possible changes in the directive, such as to provide for \"permitting\" rather than \"promotingf\"u rther expansion of bank credit and the money supply, were decided against in view of the basic decision of the Committee to continue monetary policy unchanged at this time. At the conclusion of this discussion, there was read to the Committee language for the first paragraph of the directive reflecting 5/29/62 a formulation with which there appeared to be general agreement, and the expressions of the Committee members were favorable. Accordingly, upon motion duly made and seconded, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to ex ecute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: In view of the modest nature of recent advances in the pace of economic activity, the continued underutilization of resources, and the uncertainties created by the disturbed conditions in some financial markets, it remains the current policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to promote further expansion of bank credit and the money supply, while giving recognition to the country\\'s adverse balance of payments. To implement this policy, operations for the System Open Market Account during the next three weeks shall be conducted with a view to maintaining a supply of reserves adequate for further credit and monetary expansion, taking account of the desirability of avoiding sustained downward pressures on short term interest rates. Votes for this action: Messrs. Martin, Hayes, Balderston, Bryan, Deming, Ellis, Fulton, King, Mills, Mitchell, Robertson, and Shepardson. Votes against this action: None. Chairman Martin said he wished to place on record at this point that he had told the President of the United States this morning that the Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks and the members of the Board of Governors might be counted upon to do what ever they could, regardless of whether any statement was issued by the Federal Reserve System, to maintain a sense of order in the present 5/29/62 44 situation. He did not say to the President that any particular course of action would be taken by the Federal Reserve System, but he did say, as he had indicated, that the President could count on all of the Reserve Bank Presidents and members of the Board of Governors to do whatever was possible to maintain balance. The President, in turn, expressed his desire that those in the Federal Reserve bend their best efforts in that direction. General agreement was expressed as to the appropriateness of the comment that the Chairman had made to the President. Question was raised, however, as to what kind of statement the President might have in mind that the Federal Reserve could issue. Chairman Martin responded to the effect that there had been no effort by the President to press the Federal Reserve System to do anything that it did not want to do. The President was approaching the current problem entirely from the standpoint of his responsibility as Chief Executive. The President did say that if he were doing it himself, he would be inclined to reduce margin requirements, in which connection he noted that this was the only selective credit control available. In turn, Chairman Martin said, he indicated to the President that there was a question whether the Board would feel that a reduction in margin requirements at this time was advisable. However, he had told the President that 5/29/62 -45 he would relay the latter\\'s comments to the Board. The President then suggested that if the Board was not going to change margin requirements, it might be helpful for the Board to issue a statement to such effect and give the reasons. Chairman Martin emphasized that he regarded his conference at the White House as entirely satisfactory. More specifically in response to the question that had been raised, Chairman Martin said he did not think that any of those who had conferred at the White House had in mind exactly what kind of a statement by the Federal Reserve might be helpful. Personally, he was less inclined toward the issuance of statements than some others might be; he felt there could be too many statements. There followed discussion with respect to the possible public reaction to any statement that might be issued by the Federal Reserve, including a statement that the Board did not intend to reduce margin requirements. The Chairman then repeated that in his view there was some thing more fundamental in the stock market decline than the level of margin requirements. He had been concerned for some time about the fact that a number of foreigners with whom he had talked seemed to feel that the post-war cyclical peak of the Western economies was being reached. Therefore, they were inclined to be rather bearish 5/29/62 -46 about their own countries as well as the United States. In this connection, Chairman Martin noted that substantial price declines were occurring on the European stock exchanges; the downward move ment in stock prices was fairly general and was not limited to this country. Chairman Martin commented further that he did not know what type of statement might be issued by the Federal Reserve that would be helpful. In any event, however, this was clearly not a situation where a statement could be drafted by a number of people sitting around the table, as at this meeting. He thought the comments that had been made to the press yesterday and today by the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and by the Secretary of the Treasury were essentially correct. On the basis of the reports made during the go-around at this meeting, there was nothing that would lead him to think that there should logically be general dumping of stocks at current prices. In further discussion, Mr. Mills suggested that in view of the uncertain nature of future developments the Open Market Committee might want to consider authorizing Chairman Martin to issue a state ment if, in his judgment, such a statement should seem desirable, with the understanding that the choice of words therein would be left to Chairman Martin and any person or persons with whom he might want to consult. 5/29/62 The comments that ensued indicated that the members of the Committee found it difficult to envisage any type of Federal Reserve statement that might be helpful in the present situation. At the same time, it was recognized that some turn of events might produce a situation wherein the issuance of a statement would seem desirable. Against this possibility, members of the Committee indicated that they would be agreeable to giving an authorization to Chairman Martin along the lines that had been suggested by Mr. Mills. Chairman Martin commented that this was not a responsibility he was particularly seeking. Yet it was hard to envisage what might develop within the next week or ten days. It was then moved by Mr. Shepardson and seconded by Mr. Hayes that Chairman Martin be authorized, during the period until the next meeting of the Open Market Committee, to issue a statement on behalf of the Committee with regard to stock market developments and related economic or financial developments if events should occur that in his judgment made it desirable to issue such a statement. This motion was carried by unanimous vote, subject to the understanding that in certain circumstances Chairman Martin might deem it advisable to call a special meeting of the Open Market Committee before the next regular meeting of the Committee, scheduled for Tuesday, June 19, 1962. Under date of December 11, 1961, there had been transmitted to the Committee members and other Reserve Bank Presidents a draft 5/29/62 -48 revision of the 1957 Federal Open Market Committee Guides for Emergency Operations with a request for comments. The Open Market Committee Guides had been reviewed pursuant to a suggestion made when the Board of Governors approved revised Guidelines for Emergency Monetary Policy as of May 15, 1961. In light of comments received following distribution of the preliminary draft revision of the Open Market Committee Guides, a revised draft was distributed by the Secretary of the Committee under date of May 17, 1962. Upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the revised Federal Open Market Committee Guides for Emergency Operations, in the form distributed with the Secretary\\'s memorandum of May 17, 1962, were approved. Mr. Williams then withdrew from the meeting. There had been distributed to the Committee a report from the Special Manager of the System Open Market Account on System and Treasury operations in foreign currencies and on foreign exchange market conditions for the period May 8 through May 23, 1962, along with a supplementary report for the period May 24 through May 28, 1962. Copies of these reports have been placed in the files of the Federal Open Market Committee. As indicated in those reports, there had been no System foreign currency transactions during the period since the Open Market Committee meeting on May 8, 1962. Accordingly, no action to approve, ratify, and confirm any such transactions was necessary. 5/29/62 -49 At the request of the Chairman, Mr. Coombs presented comments in supplementation of the aforementioned written reports, in the course of which he referred to certain documents that had been distributed to the Committee with respect to a possible dollar-sterling swap arrangement. The first memorandum, dated May 16, 1962, described a meeting in London on Monday, May 7, in which Mr. Coombs, Mr. Roosa, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, and representatives of the British Treasury and the Bank of England participated. As the result of this meeting a telephone call had been received by Mr. Coombs on Tuesday, May 15, from an official of the Bank of England who informed him that the British financial authorities were agreeable to a $50 million swap at flat rates and an identical interest rate, which might be set at 2 per cent. In connection with this swap possibility, there had also been distributed a memorandum from the Secretary of the Committee dated May 25, 1962, with respect to recent economic developments in the United Kingdom. In this memorandum the view was expressed that the economic outlook in the United Kingdom would justify the holding by the System of pounds sterling under a swap agreement with the Bank of England. Further, with a transmittal memorandum dated May 28, 1962, there had been distributed to the Committee a copy of a cable from Mr. Coombs to the Bank of England dated May 18, 1962, suggesting the 5/29/62 -50 text of a press release that might be used in event of the completion of a dollar-sterling swap arrangement, along with a copy of a cable sent to the Bank of England by Mr. Coombs on May 21, 1962, outlining the proposed terms of such an arrangement. The draft proposal was for a sterling-dollar swap in the amount of $50 million, the swap to have a maturity of three months and to be liquidated on date of maturity at the original rate of exchange. The Bank of England would place the resultant dollar balance in a nontransferable U. S. Treasury certificate of indebtedness which would be issued by the U. S. Treasury at par to mature three months after date of issue, but redeemable upon two days\\' notice, and which would bear interest at the rate of 2 per cent per annum. The sterling balance accruing to the Federal Reserve System would bear the same rate of interest. The swap arrangement, including the U. S. certificate of indebtedness, would be renewable upon agreement of both parties. To protect both parties against the remote risk of a revaluation of either currency, the Federal Reserve would place with the Bank of England a standing order, to be executed when necessary for that purpose, to purchase for Federal Reserve account sterling in any amount sufficient to replenish any earlier drafts upon Federal Reserve sterling balances created by the swap. The Federal Reserve would accept from the Bank of England a similar standing order. 5/29/62 -51 Mr. Coombs recommended that the Federal Open Market Committee approve a dollar-sterling swap arrangement on the terms outlined in the cable of May 21, 1962, effective May 31, 1962, in which connection he stated reasons for believing that such an arrangement would be advantageous. Mr. Robertson stated that he continued to be skeptical about the whole program of System foreign currency operations. However, inasmuch as the program had been initiated, he would be willing to vote to approve the proposed dollar-sterling swap arrangement. Inquiry was made about the desirability of issuing a press release, and Mr. Coombs commented that it was his impression that the announcement of arrangements of this kind had a stabilizing influence on the exchange markets. The reaction conceivably might be different in present circumstances, but the record had been favorable thus far. Chairman Martin indicated that he would be apprehensive about the result if such an arrangement were entered into without a press release being issued and knowledge of the arrangement nevertheless became known. Other members of the Committee expressed agreement with the views stated by Chairman Martin and Mr. Coombs. Thereupon, the proposed dollar sterling swap arrangement was unanimously approved effective May 31, 1962, with the understanding that a press release would be issued along the lines set forth in Mr. Coombs\\' cable of May 18, 1962. 5/29/62 -52 Mr. Coombs next referred to his memorandum, distributed to the Committee under date of May 21, 1962, regarding the possibility of a dollar-guilder swap arrangement with the Netherlands Bank, which might involve a pilot swap of $10 million plus a standby swap of $40 million. The memorandum pointed out, among other things, that the Netherlands Bank would be unable to place any Federal Reserve holdings of guilders in either commercial paper or a time deposit. However, it was thought probable that the Federal Reserve could obtain a guilder time deposit facility at the Bank for International Settle ments. With this exception, the suggested swap arrangement would be along the lines of the arrangement with the Bank of France. One immediate objective would be to mop up as much as possible of the prospective flow of dollars into the Netherlands when, on June 27, 1962, the Dutch Philips Corporation was to receive payment on subscriptions for a new stock issue that might yield roughly $200 million equivalent. An estimated $80 million might be raised from United States subscribers, with a $50 million inflow in prospect from subscriptions in other European countries. Since it was the traditional policy of the Netherlands Bank to convert into gold all dollar and other foreign exchange acquisitions in excess of $200 million, and since present dollar holdings of the Bank amounted to around $183 million, the dollar receipts generated by the Philips issue would mean that the Netherlands Bank would shortly be compelled to make heavy purchases of gold from the United States. 5/29/62 -53 In connection with the possible reciprocal transaction between the Federal Reserve and the Netherlands Bank, there had also been dis tributed a memorandum from the Secretary of the Committee dated May 25, 1962, which discussed recent economic developments in the Netherlands and expressed the view that the immediate economic outlook would justify the System\\'s holding of guilders under such an agreement with the Netherlands Bank. In a memorandum from the Committee\\'s General Counsel dated May 28, 1962, concerning the legal aspects of several proposed swap arrangements with foreign banks, the view was expressed that there would be no legal objection to placing Federal Reserve guilder holdings in a time deposit with the Bank for International Settlements. In comments supplementing his memorandum, Mr. Coombs noted that the possible swap arrangement would extend the dollar defense line to another important European currency and provide the possibility of mop ping up the flow of dollars into the Netherlands Bank as payment was made for the Philips issue. The Netherlands Bank was agreeable to the swap in principle. The main technical problem was the inability of the Netherlands Bank to place Federal Reserve holdings of guilders in either commercial paper or a time deposit. Therefore, Mr. Coombs had been talk ing not only with the Netherlands Bank but also with the Bank for Inter national Settlements about the possibility of a time deposit facility. Yesterday, word was received of agreement in principle on the part of both the Netherlands Bank and the Bank for International Settlements that such a time deposit facility would be feasible. The Federal Reserve would be able to obtain a rate of interest thereon equivalent to the rate 5/29/62 -54 made available to the Netherlands Bank on its holdings of dollars. In this case, Mr. Coombs felt, it might be useful to follow the pattern of the French swap and to base the interest rate upon the last Treasury bill issue immediately preceding the swap. He would regard the 2 per cent rate of interest in the proposed dollar-sterling swap as a deviation from the general pattern. The deposit with the Bank for International Settle ments would be a three-month time deposit subject to withdrawal on two days\\' notice. In response to a request from Mr. Mitchell for further elaboration of the reasons for the swap arrangement, Mr. Coombs said the Netherlands had been running more or less in even balance in international payments for the past year. However, the payment for the Philips issue would involve a substantial influx of funds. The question was whether it would not be useful to try to deter the prospective drain on U. S. gold reserves. Before the expiration of three or six months, the guilder might come under some selling pressure; the Netherlands was not in a strong surplus posi tion. The worst that could happen was that the United States would eventually lose as much gold as if there were no swap arrangement in effect. With regard to the traditional policy of the Netherlands Bank to convert into gold dollar and other foreign exchange acquisitions in excess of $200 million, Mr. Swan inquired whether, if the swap arrange ment were entered into, there was reason to believe that the Bank might be induced to alter its policy. 5/29/62 -55 Mr. Coombs replied that he thought the consummation of a swap arrangement might have such an effect. The Swiss, as a quid pro quo for Stabilization Fund forward operations, had let their dollar balances run up, and the same sort of development could occur here. He did not think that a swap arrangement would lessen the possibility of the Netherlands Bank considering some adjustment of its traditional policy. After further discussion had indicated that the Open Market Committee was inclined to look with favor on a proposed dollar-guilder swap arrangement such as described, Mr. Coombs asked whether he under stood that the Committee would prefer to authorize the negotiation of such a swap or to approve in principle. He would hope the latter, with the possibility of obtaining final approval of the arrangement by poll of the Committee. If possible, he would like to move forward on this matter before the next Committee meeting. Thereupon, unanimous approval was given in principle to a dollar-guilder swap arrangement with the Netherlands Bank along the lines described in Mr. Coombs\\' memorandum of May 21, 1962, it being understood that the arrangement was subject to final approval by the Federal Open Market Committee. Mr. Coombs then referred to his memorandum, distributed to the Committee under date of May 23, 1962, with regard to possible Belgian franc operations. Attached to the memorandum was a letter from the National Bank of Belgium suggesting a swap arrangement in the amount of $50 million for six months, renewable, with an identical interest rate on both sides. The dollars accruing to the National Bank of Belgium 5/29/62 -56 would be invested in special U. S. Treasury certificates of indebtedness, while the Belgian francs accruing to the Federal Reserve would be invested in bills (promissory notes) issued by the National Society of Credit and Industry. The U. S. certificates and the Belgian bills would be issued for six months, but would be redeemable or discountable at any time, on demand, at par value and without modification of interest. The interest rate would be 2.75 per cent on both sides. In a memorandum from the Committee\\'s General Counsel dated May 28, 1962, question was raised whether investment of Belgian francs in notes of a Belgian company engaged in providing credit for commerce and industry would be clearly authorized. However, the question was understood to have become academic. As stated in Mr. Coombs\\' memorandum of May 23, he had inquired of the National Bank of Belgium whether it would be possible to place Federal Reserve holdings of Belgian francs on time deposit with the Bank for International Settlements. The offhand reaction was that this might prove feasible, and a definite answer was promised as soon as possible. In connection with the swap possibility, there had also been distributed a memorandum from the Secretary of the Committee dated May 25, 1962, regarding recent economic developments in Belgium in which the view was expressed that the immediate economic outlook seemed more favorable than for some time and that it would justify the holding of Belgian francs under a swap agreement with the National Bank of Belgium. In supplementary comments on this swap possibility, Mr. Coombs noted that it would provide still another link in the line of bilateral 5/29/62 -57 exchange arrangements. He thought it would be possible to work out the procedure whereby Belgian franc holdings of the Federal Reserve System would be placed on time deposit with the Bank for International Settlements. He would recommend approval of a dollar-Belgian franc swap in principle, in the amount of $50 million. In response to a question as to why this swap arrangement was proposed on a six-month basis, Mr. Coombs said he thought this was intended to be something of a generous gesture on the part of the National Bank of Belgium. The letter from the National Bank might be regarded as an indication of what that Bank would be willing to consider. However, he would prefer a three-month swap on a renewable basis to keep the arrange ment more in line with the other swap arrangements negotiated or pending, and that was what he would suggest. Question was raised as to whether a swap in the amount of $50 million with the Belgians would not be out of line in terms of the arrange ments with other countries, whether $50 million was looked upon as a minimum for swap arrangements, or whether there were particular reasons for that figure in the case of the proposed transaction with the National Bank of Belgium. Mr. Coombs replied that the Belgians had suggested $50 million. Perhaps they had taken into account their policy of converting into gold practically all of their dollar inflow and thought of the $50 million figure as a gesture of cooperation from that standpoint. Mr. Coombs said he would agree that swap arrangements of $50 million all around, 5/29/62 -58 regardless of the size of the country concerned and the balance of trade, might seem somewhat illogical. In time, he thought, there might be higher figures with the Uhited Kingdom and France than with other countries. Thereupon, unanimous approval was given in principle to a dollar-Belgian franc swap arrangement with the National Bank of Belgium along the lines described in the letter from the National Bank of Belgium dated May 16, 1962, and Mr. Coombs\\' memorandum of May 23, 1962, it being understood that the arrangement was subject to final approval by the Federal Open Market Committee. Mr. Coombs next referred to his memorandum, distributed to the Committee under date of May 22, 1962, with respect to a possible swap arrangement with the National Bank of Switzerland. This involved the possibility of a medium-term credit arrangement. In conversations with Mr. Coombs in Europe, officials of the National Bank of Switzerland had indicated that the Bank would expect to provide credit under a swap arrangement on a 90-day basis, but with a tacit understanding that the credit would be renewed for as long as might prove necessary. The Bank needed protection only against some emergency situation in which the credit facility might advisedly be shifted to a medium-term basis, and it antici pated working out some arrangement with the Swiss Treasury whereby the latter would take over the credit in such circumstances. Mr. Coombs had suggested, in the alternative, consideration of a relatively short-term swap, say for three months, with the possibility of two renewals. The question whether a medium-term credit arrangment with the National Bank of Switzerland would be legally warranted was discussed briefly in the memorandum from Mr. Hackley dated May 28, 1962, referred 5/29/62 -59 to previously in these minutes. That memorandum pointed out that there was no statutory restriction upon the length or maturity of accounts that might be maintained by a Reserve Bank with a foreign bank. If it could be established that a medium-term swap arrangement was necessary or desirable in order to effectuate open market transactions in foreign currencies, Mr. Hackley felt it would be subject to no greater legal objection than a short-term, 90-day swap. However, the length of the commitment might make it more difficult, as a matter of degree, to establish that the arrangement was related to the effective conduct of open market operations. Also, an arrangement of this kind might be subject to question on policy grounds. In comments supplementing his memorandum, Mr. Coombs noted that the U. S. Treasury was not in a position to provide a medium-term credit facility to the Swiss. Further, as Mr. Hackley\\'s memorandum suggested, it might be difficult to establish that a medium-term credit facility provided by the Federal Reserve could be related effectively to the conduct of open market transactions in foreign exchange. His own view was that it would be preferable to keep such an arrangement on a short-term basis if possible. Therefore, he had suggested to the Swiss that they consider a swap arrangement on a 90-day basis, with the explicit understanding that the arrangement could be renewed for another three or six months. A short-term arrangement would not fully satisfy the apparent desire on the part of the Swiss more or less to match the standby credit facilities being provided by certain member countries of the International Monetary Fund. In terms of realities, however, an arrangement running 5/29/62 -60 for nine months might give the United States time to counter any heavy flow of speculative funds to Zurich, and possibly to bring about a reversal. Mr. Coombs then suggested that the Committee might want to authorize further negotiations with the National Bank of Switzerland for a short-term swap facility of $150 million, with $50 million as a pilot swap and the remaining $100 million put on a standby basis. If current disturbances in the stock exchanges continued, there could be a rather heavy flow of funds to Switzerland and there might well be a need for the full $150 million. In response to a request for further explanation of the basis for the Swiss suggestion for a medium-term credit arrangement, Mr. Coombs brought out that an important second line of defense was being established by the enlargement of the standby resources of the International Monetary Fund. If the dollar should get into serious difficulty, the United States could go to the Fund and pick up a sizable supply of European currencies. However, since Switzerland was not a member, the Fund arrangement did not cover the Swiss franc, and the Swiss felt a certain moral obligation to do as much as they could to close the gap. They would like to work out a facility as similar as possible to those being extended by a number of the major countries in connection with the enlargement of the standby resources of the Fund, and those facilities were on a medium-term basis. The Swiss appeared to feel that a short term arrangement might be criticized on the ground that Switzerland was 5/29/62 -61 failing to do its part. Mr. Coombs said he had suggested to the Swiss officials that it should be possible to provide a satisfactory explana tion by tying in a short-term dollar-Swiss franc swap arrangement with the swap arrangements being negotiated with other central banks. If the swap was in terms of a figure such as $150 million, the Swiss would certainly get credit on that score. Question was raised whether a $150 million swap would appear adequate, and also as to the relationship between that figure and the part that the Swiss might have been expected to play in enlarging the standby resources of the Monetary Fund had Switzerland been a member of the Fund. Mr. Coombs replied that such questions were difficult to answer. He thought that the Swiss might be ready to put up as much as $250 million on a medium-term basis. Further, unless there were basic changes in underlying conditions, he foresaw the possibility of a sizable net flow of capital to Switzerland. Conceivably, of course, the situation would turn in the other direction. Thereupon, the Open Market Committee authorized further negotiations with the National Bank of Switzerland looking toward the possibility of a dollar-Swiss franc short-term swap arrangement along the lines described by Mr. Coombs. Mr. Coombs then pointed out that the swap arrangement with the Bank of France in the amount of $50 million, which became effective March 1, 1962, would mature June 1, 1962. He recommended renewal of the arrangement for another three months; it was his understanding that the Bank of France was agreeable to such an extension. 5/29/62 -62 In this connection, Mr. Coombs commented that the French had been taking in so many dollars during the past three months that no useful opportunity had presented itself for employment of the French francs obtained by the Federal Reserve under the swap arrangement. The entire $50 million could have been exhausted quickly. Therefore, it had seemed better to wait for a time when use of French francs might bring the market into better balance. If the heavy flow of dollars into France should continue during the summer months, it might prove desirable to liquidate the swap arrangement in advance of the next maturity, say on August 1, and then to renegotiate an arrangement in the fall months when the French payments position might be less strong. In discussion, question was raised whether, in the circumstances described by Mr. Coombs, the amount of the swap with the Bank of France should not be raised or the arrangement dropped. Comments made in response by Messrs. Hayes and Coombs were to the effect that in conditions such as had existed recently the use of the French francs to the extent of $50 million would have had little or no effect. On the other hand, the existence of the arrangement and lack of use of the French francs did not appear to have created any adverse reaction. In the fall months an opportunity might come. As to increasing the amount of the swap arrangement, other negotiations were now in process between the United States and France, having to do with a possible advance debt repayment and adjustments with respect to military procurement. In the circumstances, it seemed doubtful whether this was 5/29/62 -63- an appropriate time to suggest an increase in the terms of the swap arrangement, although that might become appropriate in the fall. Thereupon, the Open Market Committee approved unanimously a three-month renewal, effective June 1, 1962, of the existing dollar-French franc swap arrangement with the Bank of France. Mr. Coombs next commented upon discussions that had been held with the Bank of Canada regarding the possibility of a swap facility involving that Bank and the U. S. Treasury. However, it had developed that the Treasury could not commit more than $25 or $30 million out of the Stabilization Fund at the present time. The reaction of the Bank of Canada was one of appreciation that this had been suggested as a token of cooperation, but the Canadians were doubtful that an arrangement of such magnitude would have much impact. It appeared that they might be interested in a swap arrangement in a much larger figure, such as $200 or $250 million, as a backstop to the recent action in establishing a par value for the Canadian dollar. Mr. Coombs raised the question whether the Open Market Committee would be interested in exploration of the possibility of a swap arrangement between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada, having in mind that the Canadians might be interested only in an arrangement of substantial size. He noted that the establishment of a par value for the Canadian dollar had been a long-sought objective of American policy. That having been done, it appeared appropriate to give some support to the Canadians. He was not sure, however, whether this 5/29/62 -64- might best be done through a Federal Reserve-Bank of Canada swap arrangement or through a Canadian drawing on the Monetary Fund. In discussion, it was noted that a Canadian drawing on the Monetary Fund would subject the Canadians to the discipline of the Fund. It was also noted, however, that the Canadians might hesitate to go to the Monetary Fund until after the forthcoming elections and that they had been subjected to a speculative outflow of funds of rather substantial proportions during the past two or three months. Mr. Mitchell raised the question whether, if the endeavor of U. S. foreign exchange transactions was to help build a strong international payments system, it would not seem almost unavoidable, in the interest of consistency, to consider a swap arrangement with the Bank of Canada. Mr. Coombs said he had such a feeling. That was why he had favored the Stabilization Fund arrangement on a $25 or $30 million basis, but that figure apparently was not high enough in the eyes of the Canadians to have any real impact. After Mr. Mitchell had suggested the possibility of negotiating with the Bank of Canada in terms of a swap of $50 or $100 million, Mr. Hayes said he shared the view that, with the Canadian economy so close to that of the United States and the Canadian currency so important to the United States, it would seem somewhat illogical not to include the Canadians in the network of swap arrangements at such time as a favorable basis for such an arrangement could be found. 5/29/62 -65 Mr. Balderston said he also shared that view. He saw virtue in taking the initiative in discussions with the Bank of Canada, so as to be able to suggest limits compatible with the Federal Reserve swap arrangements negotiated or pending with other central banks. Thereupon, the Open Market Committee authorized negotiations with the Bank of Canada looking toward the possibility of a swap arrangement between the Federal Re serve and that Bank. Mr. Coombs pointed out that on the exchange markets the United States dollar had been under considerable pressure in the past few days. It had been driven to the floor against the Swiss franc, and it was weakening against the German mark. Assuming that the German Federal Bank was prepared to intervene and buy dollars to check a further decline of the dollar rate against the German mark, he hoped that the Open Market Committee would concur in the appropriateness of using some of the Federal Reserve holdings of German marks to reinforce that operation. It seemed quite clear that a speculative movement of a reversible type was occurring, and use of the System holdings of German marks would appear to meet the criteria for intervention as stated in the Guidelines for System Foreign Currency Operations. The proposed use of Federal Reserve System holdings of German marks in the manner described by Mr. Coombs, if that should seem desirable to him in the light of developments, was noted without objec tion. With reference to the earlier discussion concerning a possible swap arrangement with the National Bank of Belgium, it was brought out that the continuing authority directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of 5/29/62 -66 New York with respect to System foreign currency operations, originally adopted by the Committee on February 13, 1962, and reaffirmed on March 6, 1962, did not authorize the purchase and sale of Belgian francs. Accordingly, upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the continuing authority directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with respect to System foreign currency opera tions was approved in the following amended form, effective immediately: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is authorized and directed to purchase and sell through spot transactions any or all of the following currencies in accordance with the Guidelines on System Foreign Currency Operations issued by the Federal Open Market Committee on February 13, 1962: Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Netherlands guilders Swiss francs Belgian francs Total foreign currencies held at any one time shall not exceed $500 million. Mr. Mitchell commented that the recent developments in the stock market had led him to wonder whether something might not happen to bring about a substantial drain on the gold supply and cause the reserve requirements specified under existing law to have to be suspended. In his opinion the existing law was clearly obsolete, having been adopted under a different set of circumstances than now prevailed. His question, therefore, was whether there should not be a re-examination of the existing law, with a view to the possibility of some change that 5/29/62 -67 would make it possible for the Federal Reserve System to meet any crisis without having to take emergency action. Chairman Martin noted that this problem had been given consid eration on previous occasions. The Committee might ask its staff to review the procedures involved so that everyone would be familiar with them. Some caution was indicated, because a planning exercise, if under stood to be in process, could lead to comment and speculation. However, he would see no objection to putting down in a paper the facts relating to the procedures provided under the present law. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, June 19, 1962. The meeting then adjourned. Assistant Secretary ',\n",
       " 'A meeting of the Federal Open Market Comittee was held in the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington on Tuesday, June 19, 1962, at 10:00 a.m. PRESENT: Mr. Martin, Chairman Mr. Hayes, Vice Chairman Mr. Balderston Mr. Bryan Mr. Deming Mr. Ellis Mr. Fulton Mr. King Mr. Mills Mr. Robertson Mr. Shepardson Messrs. Bopp, Scanlon, and Clay, Alternate Members of the Federal Open Market Committee Messrs.

Francis and Shuford, First Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis and Dallas, respectively Mr. Rouse, Vice President and Senior Adviser, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Messrs. Eastburn, Black, Baughman, Jones, Tow, Coldwell, and Einzig, Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, respectively Mr. Sternlight, Manager, Securities Department, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Upon motion duly made and seconded, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on May 8, 1962, were approved. In view of the resignation of L. Merle Hostetler from the employ of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland effective at the end of this month, Mr. Fulton nominated W. Braddock Hickman to serve as Associate Economist of the Federal Open Market Committee in place of Mr. Hostetler. Upon motion duly made and seconded, Mr. Hickman was elected Associate Economist, effective immediately. Before this meeting there had been distributed to the members of the Committee a report on open market operations in United States Government securities covering the period May 29 through June 13, 1962, and a supplementary report covering the period June 14 through June 18, 1962. Copies of both reports have been placed in the files of the Committee. Im supplementation of the written reports, Mr. Stone commented as follows: Reservea vailability has generally been comfortatbhlreo ugh out the recent perwiod,a nd the tax date has passed with little 6/19/62 -3- or no strain in an atmosphere of ample corporate and bank liq uidity. Federal funds traded for the most part at 2-3/4 per cent, although the rate dipped below that level for a few days toward the middle of the period and moved up to 3 per cent yesterday. The period was generally characterized by a broad and active demand for short-term securities both from banks and nonbank sources. The Treasury\\'s additions to the total supply of bills were readily absorbed and the 91-day rate moved from about 2.70 per cent at the start of the period to around 2.64 per cent before turning up again to slightly above 2.70 with the approach of the June 15 tax date. As several of the Committee members anticipated in their comments at the last meeting, there was somero om for differences in emphasis in carrying out a policy of \"no change\" in the System\\'s current posture. Thus, in the first part of the recent period, against the background of the highly charged atmosphere generated by the sharp break in stock prices, the emphasis in conducting operations was tilted toward the free reserve measure and the avoidance of any unsettling swings in that indicator. As the period moved along, while the stock market failed to show much bounce, it did at least settle back to a somewhat calmer tempo. This made it possible to shift the emphasis to the Committe\\'s objectives in terms of preserving the general market tone that had characterized the several preceding weeks. Throughout the period the behavior of the stock market con tinued to attract a good deal of attention. While a number of rallies have been attempted, all have proved abortive, and the declining trend of prices that set in several months ago con tinues. The pace of trading activity in stocks, which was very active in the first few days after the last meeting, tapered off during much of the period but has picked up again in the past few days, and the atmosphere continues to be unsettled. Prices of Treasury notes and bonds showed relatively minor day-to-day movements and no decisive trend during the period despite the continued weakness in stock prices and also despite some questions raised in the market concerning theu nderlying strength of the business expansion. The failure of Treasry bond prices to respond to these mdaeyv elopments in part reflect a recent resurgence of concern over the gold situation and the possibility of increased budgetary deficits ahead. Turning to Treasury financing, the Treasury has added $800 million to the bill supply in the past five weeks, and its program for cash financing over the next two months depends in good part on whether it chooses to fill out the bill cycle at $2 billion per issue or whether it will stop short of that. If the Treasury contines to add to the bills until each issue amounts to $2 6/19/62 billion, it will not, according to present estimates, have to do any additional cash finanucingt il late August. If, on the other hand, the Treasury should terminate now its program of addition to the weekly bill issue, it would have to move some of its cash borrowing ahead to July. This of course would be in addition to the rollover of the July 15 one-year bills and, in early August, the refunding of the August 15 maturities. I should mention to the Committee that we have taken a careful look at the projections of reserve needs over the next three weeks from the point of view of whether the $1 billion limitation in the continuing authority directive would be ade quate. The Board staff\\'s figures suggest a need for about $750 million, while the New York Bank\\'s projections indicate a need for perhaps $600 million. In the absence of some unforeseen- and substantial-additional drain on reserves, it seems to us that the existing limitation will not be constricting. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, the open market transactions in Government securities during the period May 29 through June 18, 1962, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. The economic review at this meeting was in the form of a visual auditory presentation for which Messrs. Garfield, Hersey, Altman, Axilrod, and Trueblood of the Board\\'s staff joined the meeting and in which they participated along with Mr. Koch. Copies of the text of the presentation and the accompanying charts have been placed in the files of the Open Market Committee. The text of the introductory portion of the economic review was as follows: These are days when economic analysts the world over are paying unusual attention to stock market developments. Trading has been heavy and price declines have been dramatic. Increas ingly over recent weeks questions have arisen concerning the effects, as well as the meanings, of these declines. Sometime in the future data can be assembled to show at least what the sequels proved to be--although not necessarily to establish 6/19/62 causal connections to everybody\\'s satisfaction. Today we might consider the purport of nonstatistical reports, and of daily quotations in various commodity and security markets; scattered weekly or 10-day reports on activity and sales through early June; and the latest weekly credit figures for city beaks. In large part, however, the latest organized information we have relates to the month of May--and even for May some figures are still missing. To make a virtue of a necessity, we might argue that in times of dramatic events it is well to take a quiet look at the background against which these events are occurring. Actually, the stage of the cycle already reached in May was of considerable interest in its own right. After 15 months of recovery and ex pansion the economy had reached a point in time after which, in the two preceding upswings, further increases in activity had been small. But conditions this time were different inc ertain- perhaps important--respects. A steel labor contract had already been negotiated, for example, whereas in midsummer of 1959 a four month strike was beginning. This time industrial prices had a recent history of three years of little change. Even before the recent decline in stock prices, expectations of a generally advancing price level had been greatly modified--by the continu ing availability of unutilized resources as well as by recent price behavior. By contrast, in mid-1959 prices had been rising during recovery; and in the previous cyclincal[siucp]s wing--the auto housing-capital goods boom of 1955-57--there had been a major advance in prices. The situation this time was different in other ways, too, and it was evident that analogies drawn from the past did not provide clear guides to the future. Domestic deelopments, of course, have continued to depend in some degree on international developments. Since the Second World War and especially since the Korean outbreak in 1950, defense outlays in this country have been at levels unprecedented for peace time. In this recovery period they have been expanding. Since 1958, moreover, balance of payments problems have been almost continuously in the foreground of economic analysis. There followed sections dealing with the balance of payments, the recent performance of the domestic economy, developments in the major categories of demand, business inventories and consumer spending, and financial developments. The presentation concluded with comments, as follows, on what the analysis of domestic business and financial conditions and of the balance of payments position might mean for monetary policy: Recent economic and financial developments have been high lighted by the gradualness of the advance in economic activity, the availability of resources to permit further advances, and the sharpest stock price decline of the postwar period. At the same time, prices in commodity markets have not risen since early 1961, and there is little evidence of any incipient infla tion. While credit supplies are ample, the liquidity of key spending sectors does not appear excessive. Internationally, our balance of payments problem remains to be solved. There have been some recent improvements, but they may have been due in part to the impact of Canada\\'s financial troubles on our capital flows. The dollar remains weaikn European markets, and private demandf or go1d has reappeared in London. To facilitate continued expansion of output domestically, the economic situation calls for further expansion in bank credit and the money supply in order to assure a ready availability of credit and longer-term capital at moderate rates of interest. The pace of such credit expansion must, of course, take into account that which has already occurred over the expansion period, as well as additional liquidity needso f the different sectors of the private economy as it grows. On the other hand, our international position calls for the avoidance of a redundancy of bank reserves, liquidity, and credit availability lest the capital outflboew  stimulated and our pay ments and gold reserve problem accentuated. Domestic and international considerations, then, call for somewhat different policy emphasis at this juncture andm ay con tinue to do so for some time, To some observers, the existence of this disparity suggests the need for a differing mix of fiscal and monetary policies. This issue is receiving increasing dis cussion in the press, and will receive more in the near-term future, now that the possibility of an across-the-board cut in tax rates has been raise by Administration spokesmen. The consequences of any change is the mix of fiscal and monetary policies, however, cannot be foreseen with assurance and risks are involved . Monetary policy and fiscal policy, while interacting in many aspects, are not simple substitutes one for the other. Each affects the economyt hrough different channels and with different time lags. Whatever change in policy mix may occur in time, monetary policy has a continuing problemo f keeping in such relation to fiscal policy that the mix fosters a high utilization of resources at home and a sustainable payments posi tion with the rest of the world. The effects of anym ix of monetary or fiscal policies depends in large part on what the underlying economic situation really is. 6/19/62 -7 As we have seen this morning, information available on developments before the recent sharp stock market declines indicated that economic activity was following an inter mediate course, not booming, not declining. In May economic activity was at a level about as much above pre-recession highs as at the comparable stage of earlier recoveries. But resources were being less fully utilized. Incentives to accumulate inventories were not great and the level of inventory holdings was not high in relation to sales. With final demands fairly strong, however, some further gradual advance in activity was widely anticipated. What the effects will be of the recent unsettlement in the stock market and, for that matter, of market developments ahead remains, of course, to be seen. Few excesses other than those in the stock market are readily discernible. Yet, in the present climate, to many market participants uncertainties as to future trends appear bigger than they normally do, and some anxieties unquestionably exist because of extended debt positions. It is too early to conclude either that the economy will be able to absorb recent market shocks and still move forward or that expansion will be interrupted. In discussion following the economic presentation, Mr. Balderston inquired as to any indications concerning the lending and collection practices of banks in the recent period of stock market decline. Speaking for the Board\\'s staff, Mr. Brill commented that little information was available. Although a survey had been author ized by the Board some time ago regardig the volume of nonpurpose lending, it was still in the pilot stage. The Secrities and ExchangeC ommission was contemplating a study of the actions of banks at other lenders during the recent severe stock market break, but this had not gone beyond the planning stage. Mr. Hayes said reresentatives oft he New York Reserve Bank had come to the general conclusion that the amount of forced 6/19/62 -8 selling under pressure by lenders was modest. Perhaps some non bank lenders had been lending on narrow margins, but this was a relatively small-scale business. One large New York City bank advised that it had asked for additional collateral on only 600 out of 12,000 loans and that there had been onlys ix sell-outs. Mr. Garvy confirmed the impression that there had been few calls is relation to the amount of credit outstanding. Many of those called for additional collateral had been able to provide it, and the number of sell-outs appeared to have been small. Mr. Bryan said that at the most recent meting of the Atlanta Reserve Bank\\'s directors, directors from Birmingham and New Orleans reported surveys indicating that the banks in those cities had not called any loans or asked for any additional collateral. This was also said by two Atlanta banks to have been true in their cases. Reports by other Reseve Bank Presidents were to the same effect. Chairman Martin then called for the usual comments aournd the table, beginning with Mr. Hayes, who presented the following state ment of his views with respect to the economic situation and monetary policy: I find it rather harder than usual to symmarize my view of the domestic economy. The latest statistics, while somewhat mixed, seem to point to continued gradual business expansion, but with nothing to suggest probable attainment of the more -9- optimistic goals originally predicted for 1962 by many observers. The pause in retail sales in May is not in itself unduly disturbing, coming on top of the rapid increase of the preceding two months, but on the other hand wcea nnot overlook the recent deterioration in business sentiment. Moreover, the purchasing agents\\' survey speaks of \"signs of fatigue\" in the improvement of business activity; and business plans for capital investment are clearly lagging, even if the steel episode did not have the catastrophic effect on spending plans that some had predicted. The lagging tendenmcayy well be enhanced by the persistent weakness in the stock market andb y the prevalent atmosphere of business uncer tainty. So far the stock market decline does not seem to have had much effect on consumers, but even here there could well be some delayed adverse influence. With respect to the causes of the stock market weakness, I find it hard to reach anyf irm conclusions. While it is easy to point to some correction, in a noninflationary environment, of the high price-earnings ratios and speculative fever of the last year or two, this does not wholly explain the timing and intensity of the drop. Our fragmentary findings do not confirm the wide spread press suggestions that forced selling through pressure by lenders, and selling from foreign sources, were important causes of the decline, although they doubtless had some contributing influence. Pessimism over the longer-range outlook for profit margins and widespread questioning of certain aspects of Admin istration leadership undoubtedly played a significant part; and a slower rate of stock accumulation by large institutional buyers since the latter part of 1961, coupled with an increased volume of new stock offerings, doubtless tended to weaken the market \\' s underpinnings some months ago. As for the latest balance of payments indications, the picture is mixed but on balance still very vulnerable. While the May over-all deficit was sharply lower than in the two preceding months-and while this occurred despite a probable substantial rise in long-term capital outflows-I suspect that the improvement was due in large measure to Canada\\'s diffi culties. The dollar has been persistently weak in European markets. Although the gold stock has remained steady now for five weeks, this has not prevented a growing state of nervous ness on currencies in general and on the dollar in particular. This is evidenced, for example, by the heavy buying pressure in the London gold market in recent weeks, as well as by the rising interest in gold shares. Despite the somewhat better outlook for the balance of payments figures themselves in the second and 6/19/62 -_10- third quarters, the position of the dollar, in the light of cur rent heavy dollar holdings abroad and growing nervousness in the gold and exchange markets, cannot be looked upon with complacency. Total credit at commercial banks rose again in May, resum ing the rise that had been interrupted in April, The demand for business loans continues relatively weak, in keeping with the absence of buoyancy in the business picture. The decline in the money supply should be viewed in the light of an unusually large build-up in Government deposits and a rise in time deposits. Liquidity of the banks remains at a high level; and the banks are both able and willing to reach out for new outlets for their funds, including foreign term loans in the case of some of the large New York banks. Under these complex circumstances, it is not easy to form a clear-cut judgment as to appropriate monetary policy. Neverthe less, I believe that the balance of considerations is strongly on the side of a firmer policy. For one thing, it seems to me that the liquidity of the country is high enough so that the domestic economy can, in all probability, take in stride somewhat firmer rates and a lesser degree of ease. In a sense our policy of ease has probably contributed about all that it can to the current expansion. If additional Government measures are needed to stimulate the economy, they are more likely to be found in the fiscal area than imn onetary policy. Of course, the weakness in the stock market and the nervous business atmosphere argue against any sharp or drastic change of policy. The gravity of the dollar\\'si nternational position is such that we should re-examine the question whether we have been doing all that we could in the monetary field to improve our balance of payments and foreign confidence in our currency. It is not easy to demonstrate to what extent a firmer monetary policy would dampen outward capital flows, both short term and long term, but I believe there is a growing body of expert opinion--with which I would concur--that the effect might well be considerable. More over, the increasing likelihood of a tax cut in the coming year and a resulting substatial deficit in the Federal budget points to a need for progress towards a higher rate structure to permit orderly financing of that deficit. To put it another way, foreign confidence in the dollar could be seriously hurt if the impression were to gain ground abroad that a more expansionary fiscal policy was likely to be accompanied by an unchanging policy of monetary ease. Conversely, I do not believe that foreign confidence would be shaken if a tax cut carefully designedt o help restore busi ness confidence and stimulate expansion, especially in business investment, were backed up by a firmer monetary policy. 6/19/62 -11 I would repeat, then, that in my judgment the time has come for some modification in our monetary policy. The weakness of the stock market and the nervous business atmosphere suggest that, in the first instance at least, this policy change should be gradual and cautious. I think the Manager should be given a high degree of flexibility to probe toward lesser ease, with the hope of getting bill rates somewhat higher and avoiding downward rate pressure in the Federal funds market. The feel of the market should, I think, be a major guide, with the level of free reserves a secondary consideration, and with the proviso of course that a close watch would have to be kept on possible reperecssions of such probing toward lesser ease on the domestic situation, and especially on the stock market. A decision as to whether to make a more overt policy move might well wait for further clarification of the Administration\\'s fiscal plans, and naturally such a move would be much more effec tive and would meet with greater public understanding if it enjoyed the Administration\\'s support as a part of a broader program. No discount rate change seems desirable in the immediate future, although we may have to consider one before very long; but even the gradual shift in open market policy I have advocated would call for some modification today of the present directive. Mr. Ellis reported that the New England economy seemed to be running along quite smoothly, with no pronounced trends evident. While manufacturing output was up in April, available data for May indicated no further gain. Unemployment showed some decline in April, and it appeared that the decline any have continued in May. Auto salesmen remained optimistic, but department store sales declined in April and May after seasonal adjustment and a further decline was suggested by weekly figures for June. The most recent purchasing agents\\' survey showed a reduction of inventories anda shortening of forward order- ing policy. 6/19/62 -12 Loans of First District weekly reporting banks continued at a high level, but loan demand seemed to have slackened somewhat since April. After an interruption in the expansion of time deposits, the most recent weekly figures suggested a resumption of the growth trend. Bankers continued to suggest that interest rates should be higher, giving as a reason the probable effect on international capital flows. Mr. Ellis noted that the economic presentation this morning had seemed to point out that this was a period of turbulence and change. He also noted that analysts in the Boston area were tending to modify their assessment of prospects for the balance of the year, with a fairly general marking down of previous estimates of gross national product for the fourth quarter. Mr. Ellis expressed agreement with the staff assessment that the problem of monetary policy was one of maintaining adequate but not redundant reserves. In the absence of fiscal action designed to move the economy forward, and in the absence of international repercussions from the stock market decline that would accelerate the outward flow of gold, he came out in his thinking that the wisest course would be to make no change in policy at this time. He doubted the appropriateness of moving on the monetary front in anticipation of fiscal action; that would bring on the Federal Reserve 6/19/62 -13 responsibility in the public view for whatever might happen, partic ularly if blame was to be assessed. While he was sympathetic toh e analysis presented by Mr. Hayes, in his view there should not be a probing toward less ease at this time for two reasons. First, if the probing was not effective in the sense that it did not affect the course of the economy , there would be no point in probing. Second, assuming that it would be effective, he thought this was the wrong time to undertake such a probing. In other words, he did not feel that it would be appropriate to make any significant move in response to international pressures while uncertainties about the domestic economy were growing. Accordingly, he came out to no change in the System\\'s posture at this time. That would mean a continuation of money market ease, with a comfortable availability of reserves. It would mean free reserves of around $400 million and the continued use of open market operations to offset downward pressures on short term rates, while allowing such rates to rise if market pressures should carry them in that direction. He would not be inclined to change the policy directive or the discount rate at this time. Mr. Shuford reported that there had been little change recently in the Eleventh District economy. Industrial production was up slightly and there had been sme increase in nonagricultural employment. There had been a little improvement in the chemical 6/19/62 -14 industry as well as electronics. The oil situation was mixed, crude oil production having declined a little while refinery runs were up somewhat. Retail trade continued strong, although May figures showed a slight decline from the previous month. Agricultural activity reflected an improved moisture situation. Wheat output was down substantially due to Government restrictions, but cash receipts from agriculture nevertheless were up considerably. As to the financial picture, loan demand in the District appeared to be a little stronger than in the nation generally. Loans were up, along with investments. Time and savings deposits showed a slight decline, but demand deposits were up strongly. While purchases and sales of Federal funds were both down, the margin of average weekly purchases over sales continued about the same as it had been running. Borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank were nominal. Mr. Shuford noted that the Vice Chairman of the Dallas Bank, a man with long experience in the international area, had written a memorandum to the other directors, with a copy to President Irons, in which he expressed concern with respect to the degree of monetary ease. At the most recent directors\\' meeting, the directors appeared more concerned and were more vocal than for some time. Some of the con cern no doubt reflected the stock market situation, but the directors had also received the memorandum from the Vice Chairman. There was 6/19/62 -15 some discussion of sending the Board of Governors a letter summarizing the views expressed at the meeting, but it was finally resolved that the Chairman of the Board would probably write a short letter to the Board of Governors referring to the concern of the directors. Mr. Swan reported that the Twelfth District business situation seemed to reflect a good deal of uncertainty and mixed trends, with perhaps a further--but no more than a very gradual--improvement in May. While no June figures on auto sales were yet available, in the first half of May sales in California were down quite sharply from the first half of April. However, department store sales had been quite well sustained through May. There was considerable uncertainty in the fact that labor negotiations in certain major areas of production seemed far from reaching any satisfactory conclusion at the moment. There were shutdowns in construction because of labor problems in several parts of the District. The District banking situation showed little change. The banks were looking eagerly for business loans, but did not appear able to develop them in any substantial volume. Real estate loans, however, were still rising. Savings deposits, after a decline in April that appeared to be associated with income tax payments, increased in May. However, the increase was significantly smaller than in May 1961. 6/19/62 -16 Mr. Swan commented that it was not yet possible to assess the effects of the recent stock market behavior on business and consumer spending plans. In any event, however, the behavior of the market was casting a rather large shadow of uncertainty over a business situation that of itself had been displaying something less than satisfactory progress, Consequently, it seemed to him that monetary policy should not be made tighter at the moment, for that would only introduce further uncertainties. He agreed with Mr. Ellis that changes should not be made in monetary policy in anticipation of possible fiscal moves, particularly under present circumstances. It must be recognized that uncertainties continued to exist and that there was a possibility, at least, of some significant deterioration in the business situation. He would not recommend a change in the dis count rate at this time, and in his opinion the language of the policy directive adopted at the May 29 meeting continued to be appropriate. In terms of free reserves, he would prefer to think of $450 million rather than $400 million. While he would not attempt to offset upward pressures on the bill rate if the market supplied them, he doubted that such a development would occur. Neither, within reasonable limits, would he attempt to offset downward pressures. 6/19/62 -17 Mr. Deming reported that the most recent economic data for the Ninth District continued to show a generally expanding economy, with gains in May and the first half of June appparently a little better than seasonal Whether the District expansion was running slightly ahead of ors lightly behind the national rate was open to question; the answer depended largely on what period of time was used for comparison. Speaking broadly, however, it seemed fair to say that the differences in rate of gain were not significant, except possibly in one respect. Four specific points about the Ninth District were then noted by Mr. Deming. First, the agricultural crop situation could be classed as excellent for this time of year. Badly needed rainfall had turned rather poor prospects into good ones, and continued rain had now changed the good prospects to excellent. Second, iron ore shipments through May totalled almost 11 million tons, more than double the amount in the same period last year although well below the volume shipped in 1959 and 1960. Third, general retail sales had been rather weak recently, but this might reflect no more than the long newspaper strike in Minneapolis. Auto sales had been quite good. Finally , the District banking picture continued to show more life than the national scene. City bank loan growth, in dollar amount and percentagewise, was at a record level in May. At country banks the May loan expansion in dollars was exceeded 6/19/62 -18 only in 1959, andp ercentagewise only in two previous years. Available figures for June were inconclusive beyond indicating that loan growth had continued. Deposits also showed continued strength in both classes of banks, influenced mainly by time deposit growth. As a result, despite the fairly sharp increase in loans, loan-deposit ratios at both city and country banks were lower than a year ago, and at city banks were 7 to 8 points below their postwar highs of two years ago. With respect to monetary policy, Mr. Deming said he found himself in a quandary, a position that was growing increasingly uncomfortable because of the length of time it had prevailed. The quandary resulted not merely from the oft-cited conflict between domestic and international monetary objectives but also from the curret course of the domestic economy when viewed against the backgroundo f previous years. Turning to some statistics that he thought impressive, Mr. Deming noted that in the past 52 years the year-to-year change in real GNPh ad been positive 34 times and negative 18 times. In 10 of the 52 years, the changes were less the 1 per cent, plus or minus; in 11 years there were losses of more than 1 per cent; in 9 years there were gains of 1 to 5 per cent; and in 22 years there were gainosf  more than 5 per cent. The large gains came either in war years or in years following sharp drops in total output. 6/19/62 -19 Continuing, Mr. Deming pointed out that the increase in dollar GNP from the first quarter of 1958 through the second quarter of 1959 was more than 12 per cent. From the first quarter of 1961 to the second quarter of 1962, the gain was about 11 per cent. From the fourth quarter of 1961 to the second quarter of 1962, the rise was about 5 per cent annual rate. Even though the second quarter change was disappointing, the quarter was better than the first quarter, and appreciably better in terms of final takings. As a matter of fact, the current expansion rate compared favorably with the record of 34 of the past 52 years, and specifically with every year since 1951 save 1955 and 1959. Mr. Deming went on to say that he had concluded, after looking at some long-term series on bank credit andl iquidity in an attempt to obtain perspective on current positions, that the general liquidity position was reasonably good and that bank liquidity was significantly improved from the postwar lows of 1959 and 1960. As to the money supply, its recent performance seemed to be inordinately affected by the course of Goverment deposits. Factors such as he had cited, Mr. Deming said, made his feel that the need to continue to pursue so easy a monetary policy as had prevailed for some time was unnecessary and conceivably might be unwise. On the other hand, he had difficulty in finding positive 6/19/62 -20 reasons, on the domestic side, for moving toward less ease. In fact, recent developments added to this difficulty. Balance of payments reasons might argue for some movement toward less ease, but at the moment they did not seem to him to be very persuasive. He might be more persuaded if fiscal actions were leading to more expansionary strength, which might be the situation for the future, especially if there should be a tax cut. Accordingly, Mr. Deming said, his policy prescription was one of essentially no change, but with any deviations on the side of less ease. To put it another way, he would suggest a very gradual shift, perhaps no more than a probe, toward a less easy position. Specifically, he would let free reserves float below $400 million, about as they had done during the past week. He would hope that the bill rate would move up to 2-3/4 per cent or higher and would try to keep the Federal funds rate in that area or higher. While he would not change the discount rate, he would change the policy directive slightly to reflect the slight shift in posture that he had suggested. The language adopted at the May 29 meeting applied more to the sharp break in the stock market than to the present somewhat less unsettled, although not particularly favor able, conditions in the market. As a suggestion for the directive, Mr. Deming submitted the following; 6/19/62 -21 In view of the modest nature of recent advances in the pace of economic activity, the continued underutilization of resources, and the uncertainties reflected in some financial markets, it is the current policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to permit further expansion of bank credit and the money supply, while giving recognition to the country\\'s adverse balance of payments and the level of bank liquidity. To implement this policy, operations for the System Open Market Account during the next three weeks shall be conducted with a view to maintaining a supply of reserves adequate, but slightly smaller seasonally adjusted, for further credit and monetary expansion, taking account of the desirability of avoiding sustained downward pressures on short-term interest rates. Mr. Scanlon reported that measures of economic activity relating to employment, production, and retail sales continued to be mildly favorable in the Seventh District. Nevertheless, there appeared to have been a deterioration of business confidence that must be given consideration in assessing economic prospects and formulating monetary policy. Discussions with businessmen, bankers, and economists indicated a widespread tendency to downgrade earlier optimistic expectations. It had become fairly common to \"move up\" the expected date of the next downturn to the fourth quarter of the current year. As yet, there was no specific evidence that capital spending projects had been affected adversely. However, local surveys indicated that many business firms planned to reduce inventories or at least hold down further accumulations. This was suggested 6/19/62 -22 also by the continued sluggishness in steel orders. Local surveys also indicated that hiring intentions had been scaled down from earlier plans. Employment in the District apparently continued to move up moderately in areas not directly affected by the steel cutbacks, and new claims for unemployment compensation continued to run substantially below the levels of either a year or two years ago. Steel production was still declining, although slowly. Industry estimates indicated that the current rate of steel consumption by fabricators would support an annual rate of ingot production of at least 100 million tons, as compared with the current production rate of 82 million tons. Nevertheless, orders continued to be disappointing, suggesting either that the pre-accord inventory build-up as greater than had been thought or that many customers were prepared to reduce stocks to very low levels. The pace of auto deliveries in the first 10 days of June, although 20 per cent above the same period of last year, was about the same as in 1959 and 1960. This was disappointing to the industry. Production would decline somewhat in June, and substantial declines would occur, of course, in July and August. Auto makers seemed intent upon reaching the model changeover period with smaller inventories than last year. 6/19/62 -23- Contacts with large Midwest producers of capital goods indicated that new orders exceeded last year by about 10 per cent for the first five months. Gains approximating this proportion were noted by firms in the industrial equipment, electrical generating equipment, and farm and construction machinery industries. Construction machinery orders were very strong in April and May after a slow start early in the year. Reserve positions of large city banks had continued to be relatively easy and borrowings at the discount window had remained negligible. Demand for business loans at Seventh District banks had continued somewhat stronger than in the rest of the nation. Some loan officers indicated that they detected a weakening in the demand for loans during the past two weeks; however, this might be largely seasonal. As to policy, Mr. Scanlon said that he had great sympathy for Mr. Hayes\\' analysis. However, in view of the increasing uncertainty and continued dissatisfaction with the tempo of business activity, he did not believe he would take any steps that would tend substantially to reduce the availability of credit at this time. Slightly, yes, but not substatially. He would not favor a change of discount rate, and he felt that the policy directive could appropriately be continued without change . 6/19/62 -24-. Mr. Clay commented that recent domestic economic developments underscored earlier doubts concerning the vigor of the expansion that was under way. The various indicators presented a mixed picture, with only a moderate increase in aggregate activity. Moreover, a search for sources of stimulus to expansion in the months ahead sufficient to make important inroads on available manpower and other resources did not produce encouraging results. One of the most disquieting pieces of domestic economic information of recent days was the Commerce-SEC report on business capital outlays. In addition to once again reporting a shortfall for the last completed quarter compared with the earlier projection, the full-year projection showed no expansion over the previous survey. The probability of business capital spending exceeding the survey projection for the year was very small under present conditions of demand for goods and unused productive capacity. At this stage of a business upswing, the economy was particularly dependent upon business capital outlays as a source of expanding activity. The modest scale of the outlays projected thus raised disturbing questions as to its impact on both the extent of the current upswing and its duration. If monetary policy were shaped entirely in terms of domestic considerations, and apart from the international balance of payments 6/19/62 -25 problem, Mr. Clay felt that it would be desirable to shift to a policy of more aggressive ease. All factors considered, however, he thought it appropriate to pursue essentially the same monetary policy in the period ahead that had been agreed upon at the meeting three weeks ago. This would include the Committee\\'s goal with respect to the Treasury bill rate. No change was recommended in the discount rate, and in his opinion the directive was suitable in its present form. Mr. Wayne reported that Fifth District business had continued to make gradual progress. Manufacturers still reported increases in employment, workweeks, and shipments. Textile demand was slightly stronger, business was a little better for lumber producers, and furniture makers continued to prosper. Construction remained a source of strength, as evidenced by April increases in employment and contract awards. Retailers continued to report good business, and much-needed rains had greatly improved the agricultural outlook. Loan demand at District banks had been showing some improvement. Nevertheless, Mr. Wayne continued, a spreading sense of uncertainty was apparent among District businessmen, and some statistical evidence was unfavorable. Manfacturers reported a recent leveling out of new orders. Coal production and domestic shipments had been trending generally downward, although mine operators remained optimistic 6/19/62 -26 about the long run. Residential and nonresidential contract awards declined in April. Cigarette production during the first third of this year showed very little increase over 1961--nowhere near the 4 per cent per year growth rate typical of recent years. Despite the improved outlook, it was unlikely that this year\\'s crops would equal last year\\'s bumper harvests. Whether these areas would prove to be major trouble spots was uncertain. Up until now, however, the trend of over-all District activity had been clearly upward. With respect to policy, Mr. Wayne noted the possibility that the time might be approaching when monetary policy and fiscal policy would appear to be moving in different directions. It seemed reasonable to believe that fiscal measures designed to spur the economy might be taken in the not too distant future. Under such circumstances, considering the international situation, it would seem that the proper mix would involve a firmer monetary policy, not in an effort to thwart any bolstering fiscal policy but to provide necessary defense for the dollar internationally. The Federal Reserve System should be prepared to accept the responsibility involved in arriving at such a mix of monetary and fiscal policy. Mr. Wayne went on to say that he found himself in agreement with the analysis of Mr. Hayes as to the proper posture of System policy at this time. As he understood it, this did not imply any 6/19/62 -27 overt reduction in the availability of money but rather a slight trending toward somewhat firmer monetary conditions. It would imply letting free reserves drift below $400 million, and if there should be a slight firming of short-term rates, that would be all to the good. He was inclined to favor changing the directive along the lines suggested by Mr. Deming. Mr. Mills commented that the state of the economy and the turbulence in international financial markets caused him to repeat his earlier pleas to the Committee to abandon the apathetic approach that had characterized the development of Federal Reserve System policy for a long time and to turn attention to the international situation, which had an increasingly direct influence on the domestic economy. At present, a combination of circumstances offered a new opportunity for a policy change. First, professional observers were now anticipating and urging a change in policy. Second, natural factors had automatically reduced the level of free reserves, thereby facilitating an inconspicuous policy change. Third, the Treasury wold be absent from the market for new money for a reasonable period of time. The stage therefore had been set for a policy change which, if not undertaken, could unsettle confidence in the leadership and judgment that was expected of Federal Reserve System policy-making. To effect the change, the level of free reserves could be kept around the $350 million range into which they had drifted recently. 6/19/62 -28 In order to reflect a policy such as he advocated, and in order to focus attention on the availability of credit as a prime responsibility of Federal Reserve System policy-making, Mr. Mills suggested that the current policy directive might be changed to read as follows: In view of the modest nature of recent advances in the pace of economic activity, the continued underutilization of resources, and the uncertainties created by the disturbed conditions in international financial markets, the current policy of the Federal Open Market Committee is to insure a degree of credit availability which will be sufficient to meet prospective needs for bank credit but will take greater account of the country\\'s adverse balance of payments. To implement this policy, operations for the System Open Market Account during the next three weeks shall be conducted with a view to maintaining a supply of reserves adequate to permit the satisfaction of demands for bank credit within the bounds of a supply of reserves geared to the size of such demands. Mr. Robertson said he would weigh more heavily the domestic than the international situation, It seemed to him, therefore, that this was precisely the wrong time to be trying to tighten as far as monetary policy was concerned. Conditions were uncertain at the moment, and that uncertainty should restrain the System from trying to move in either direction. Accordingly, it would be wise at this juncture to maintain the policy that the Committee had been trying to follow for some time in order to do whatever was possible to aid the domestic economy, which was characterized by underutilization of resources and excessive unemployment. This would suggest a free 6/19/62 -29 reserve target between $400 and $450 million. He would not want at this time to anticipate fiscal policy moves that certainly were not coming into effect tomorrow or the next day. He would not attempt to offset, to any noticeable degree, either upward or downward pressures on short-term rates. As to the directive, it appeared to him that some of the changes made were more in the nature of word changes than otherwise. While he did not object to such changes, he could see no purpose in making them. Mr. Shepardson expressed agreement with the views stated by Messrs. Hayes, Deming, and Mills, which were in accord with those he had stated at recent Committee meetings. Changes in the policy directive along the lines suggested by Mr. Deming or by Mr. Mills would be satisfactory to him. In his judgment, it was time for the Committee to make the policy changes indicated by the suggested language. Mr. King commented that it was entirely possible that changes such as Mr. Hayes and others had suggested would be necessary at some time. However, he did not believe that this was quite the time. In his judgment, recent stock market developments would have significant reverberations that would continue indefinitely, and he would not like to see the Federal Reserve System assume the blame for everything that might go wrong in the economy. A move toward lesser ease at this point would run that risk. Therefore, his policy prescription today would be to \"stay exactly where we are.\" 6/19/62 -30 Mr. Fulton reported that in the Fourth District, with steel sales losing ground in May, new car sales and unemployment data provided the only discernible favorable factors in the economic picture. New car sales increased further in May throughout the District and seemed to be sustained in the early part of June. Department store sales were estimated to have eased off slightly in May; for the year to date they were 4 per cent above a year ago, compared with a 6 per cent rise for the nation. The unemployment situation, while not good in the steel areas, had improved somewhat in the other parts of the District. Steel production had dropped off faster in the Fourth District than elsewhere in the nation, particularly during the past five weeks. The latest week showed a slight increase, but it was questioned whether the increase was sustainable. One steel executive had expressed the view personally that the rate of production in the first quarter of this year would not be matched again until 1964. In April, construction in the District fell below the previous year for the first time in 1962. For the year to date the percentage increase in total District construction had been less than a quarter of the increase nationally. Inquiries did not seem to turn up changes in business plans for spending, however, although there was some indication of uncertainty as to longer-run plans. 6/19/62 -31 Turning to policy, Mr. Fulton said he would like to align himself with the views expressed by Mr. Hayes and to repeat the conclusions he (Mr. Fulton) had stated at the May 29 Committee meeting. He felt that the Committee had baited the trap well with reserves and had not found takers. The liquidity of the banking system may have been overdone, and the situation could become unmanageable. The level of free reserves for the past week seemed to him appropriate; he would prefer that free reserves run between $300 and $400 million rather than between $400 and $500 million. However, emphasis should be placed on the feel of the market, with the Manager given adequate latitude to endeavor to maintain the short-term rate at 2-3/4 per cent or better. In his opinion, such a policy would not deter any real advance in the economy, and it would place the System in a better position to move in either direction according to what might develop. He would not recommend changing the discount rate at this time. As to the policy directive, some words could perhaps be changed. However, he would have no particular feeling in that regard. Mr. Bopp said information available for the Third District indicated that the labor force picture had brightened gradually, production had increased slowly, construction awards had shown consistent strength, and autemobile and department store sales had been very good. With few exceptions, however, the data were a month old, so it remained to be seen whether business in the District had been experiencing hesitation or drop in confidence recently. 6/19/62 -32 The District banking picture suggested some increased pressure from both the demand and supply side. Loans had been rising, while investments had declined somewhat. Deposits recently had dropped by a significant amount. Measures of liquidity and borrowing (in the Federal funds market rather than from the Reserve Bank) also reflected less ease. As for policy, Mr. Bopp observed that the basic conflict remained between a desire to stimulate the domestic economy and a need to strengthen the balance of payments. In his view, the Committee\\'s policy to date had succeeded, probably as much as could be expected under the circumstances, in resolving this conflict. He would favor continuing this policy. However, in recommending no change in policy, as ue had for some months, his reasons had changed somewhat. The need for domestic stimulus was more pressing than before; the repercussions of moving toward less ease would be more serious than before. The necessity for putting brakes on the economy in the foreseeable future seemed less and less likely, so there was little need to let up on the accelerator on this score. It was true that fiscal policy should give increasing stimulus to the economy in coming months, but it would be a mistake to use that as justification for less ease at this time. For the next three weeks, therefore, he would continue approximately the same degree of ease (disregarding the drop in free reserves last week) and approximately 6/19/62 -33 the same range of rates as in the past. He would continue the present directive and existing discount rates. Mr. Bryan indicated that the Sixth District continued to be characterized by a gradual increase in economic activity. He could think of little that had been said with regard to other Districts that could not also be said in regard to the Sixth District. Mr. Bryan went on to say that he would align himself with those who had advocated no essential change in policy. He added that at the most recent directors\\' meeting of the Atlanta Bank a good deal of time was spent in discussing the effect of recent stock market developments. While the total effect could not be estimated, there was unanimous agreement that the market decline had impaired the outlook for economic expansion. With regard to a subject discussed by Mr. Shepardson at the May 29 meeting, Mr. Bryan said he was appalled by reports from the staff of the Atlanta Bank with regard to the trend of farm land prices in the Sixth District. It appeared that at some point there might not only be shock waves in the equity market but in the real estate market as well, and he would not want to magnify them by a restrictive monetary policy. While he could sympathize with the view that there was a dangerous balance of payments situation, he did not feel that this could be remedied by monetary policy. This was because, in his judgment, the balance of payments difficulty had not been caused by monetary policy. Accordingly, he came out in his thinking at about the same point as Mr. King. 6/19/62 -34 Mr. Francis reported that business activity in the Eighth District had shown moderate improvement since April. Unemployment in the major labor market areas appeared to have declined from April to May, and department store sales rose more than seasonally. According to preliminary data, they were continuing at a high level in early June. Bank debits also rose somewhat in May. However, in dustrial use of electric power in the major cities of the District declined from April to May on a seasonally adjusted basis. Crop prospects were good throughout the District. Total deposits at District banks showed no particular change in May or early June, the upward trend in time deposits having been off-set by a decline in demand deposits. Loans increased but investments declined, so the total volume of bank credit was little changed. Business loans increased rather sharply in Little Rock, rose moderately in St. Louis, showed approximately no change in Memphis, and showed a greater than seasonal decline in Louisville. Mr. Balderston said he felt there were possibilities of serious crises. As to the best System posture for meeting them, however, he was not sure. As Mr. Bryan had suggested, a severe decline in land prices would have repercussions on the economy of grave consequence, so attention could not be confined to stock market prices. The Canadian situation was also of concern, from the standpoint 6/19/62 -35 of trade and of finance. Even the Swiss situation did not seem to be free from concern in view of its adverse trade situation. On balance, Mr. Balderston favored continuance of about the present System policy for the period just ahead, using $400 million as a free reserve target. The actual level has been about $450 million for the three weeks ending June 13. He would be inclined to leave the policy directive unchanged. Chairman Martin said that this had been an interesting meeting, with a full expression of views around the table. He wanted to make his own position clear. After careful consideration over a period of time, he felt personally that the time had come when those in the System ought to stand up and be counted. As he had remarked many times, the importance of monetary policy should not be exaggerated. However, he felt that what was required at the present time was to be \"steady in the boat,\" which did not mean the continuation of a policy that was being construed in some quarters as ease compounded by ease. Accordingly, he wished to align himself with the point of view expressed by Messrs. Hayes, Deming, and Mills. Chairman Martin went on to explain that while he wanted an easy money policy continued, he also favored somewhat less ease than had prevailed, and he would be willing to take whatever risks were 6/19/62 -36 involved. In his judgment, the Committee would have made a mistake had it moved two months ago. It could have been blamed for the stock market collapse. Now, however, with an international situation that had not yet reached the crisis stage but which, in the present temper of things, could reach that stage quickly, he felt that the System would be in a stronger position if it supplied a reduced level of reserves and permitted interest rates to firm in the absence of a decline in loan demand. Loan demand had been disappointing throughout, but the System had supplied reserves intensively for a long time. It was easy to get twisted up in the money supply figures, the Chairman noted. As nearly as he could observe, however, there was no question today but that mortgage rates were beginning to decline. There had been no lack of availability of funds in any area of the country for a long period. In fact, a decision by the Federal Reserve to follow a somewhat less active easy money policy might give impetus and strength to the economy rather than the reverse. This was, of course, a matter of judgment. Chairman Martin brought out that he would consider it most unfortunate for the Federal Reserve to make any dramatic or overt change of policy at this time. He was thinking in terms of a very delicate operation--an operation designed to make clear that the Federal Reserve had a policy, that it did not intend just to drift along and continue to compound ease with ease. 6/19/62 -37 Chairman Martin repeated that it was important for the Federal Reserve actually to have a policy, and he questioned whether \"ease compounded with ease\" was really a policy. There would continue to be easy money with a slightly lower level of free reserves than at present. The only way he could make a distinction was to say that the situation would be less easy. The time had come, in his judgment, when the Committee ought to make that clear. As to the current policy directive, Chairman Martin said he would be prepared to accept either the language suggested by Mr. Deming or the language suggested by Mr. Mills. First, however, he would propose that a vote be taken on the question of a shift of policy toward slightly less ease; that is, the maintenance of an easy money policy but a move toward slightly less ease. Accordingly, a vote was taken on the general policy position expressed by Chairman Martin. The vote indicated that those Committee members who would favor such a position included, along with the Chair man, Messrs. Hayes, Balderston, Deming, Ellis, Fulton, Mills, and Shepardson. Those recording their dissent were Messrs. King and Robertson. Mr. Bryan voted \"present.\" In an exchange of comments that ensued, Chairman Martin noted that he had refrained intentionally from presenting the statement of 6/19/62 -38 general policy position in terms of any particular free reserve figure. Mr. Shepardson inquired, however, whether it might not be anticipated that such a position was likely to be associated with a free reserve figure under $400 million, rather than above, and the Chairman responded affirmatively. Mr. Hayes indicated that he would be inclined to think primarily in terms of a somewhat firmer feel in the market. Consideration then was given to the current economic policy directive, and the formulations that had been suggested earlier by Messrs. Deming and Mills were read again to the Committee. Mr. Hayes presented at this point a third alternative formulation. In discussion, Mr. Deming indicated that he would accept the wording suggested by Mr. Mills or that of Mr. Hayes, while Mr. Mills said that his position on the directive likewise was flexible and that he would be willing to withdraw his suggestion and accept that of Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes expressed a preference for wording in the second paragraph of the directive outlining how policy would be implemented that would place emphasis on a somewhat firmer market tone. Chairman Martin then turned to Mr. Stone, who said a directive such as suggested by Mr. Hayes would mean to him, in terms of implemen tation, that Federal funds probably should trade generally around 2-3/4 6/19/62 -39 to 3 per cent, moving only temporarily down to 2-1/2 per cent or below. Any temporary liquidity bulge that might develop would be absorbed before it threatened to encourage capital outflows. On the other hand, reserve needs that were generated from business expansion within the economy would be readily accommodated. After further discussion, there was placed before the Committee for action the current policy directive that had been proposed by Mr. Hayes. Accordingly, upon motion duly made and seconded, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to effect transactions for the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: It is the current policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to permit the supply of bank credit and money to increase further, but at the same time to avoid redundant bank reserves that would encourage capital outflows inter nationally. This policy takes into account, on the one hand, the gradualness of recent advance of economic activity, the availability of resources to permit further advance in activity, and the unsettlement of financial markets result ing from the sharp decline in stock prices. On the other hand, it gives recognition to the bank credit expansion over the past year and to the role of capital flows in the country\\'s adverse balance of payments. To implement this policy, operations for the System Open Market Account during the next three weeks shall, to the extent consistent with the behavior of financial mar kets, be conducted with a view to providing a somewhat smaller rate of reserve expansion in the banking system than in recent months and to fostering a moderately firm tone in money markets. 6/19/62 -4o- Votes for this action: Messrs. Martin, Hayes, Balderston, Bryan, Deming, Ellis, Fulton, Mills, and Shepardson. Votes against this action: Messrs. King and Robertson. Mr. Bryan stated that his vote on the current policy directive was premised on the adoption by a majority of the Committee of the general policy position on which a vote had previously been taken. Chairman Martin commented that the shift in policy that had been agreed upon by the Committee was of a very modest nature, It was important that those present at this meeting bear in mind the need for care in discussions outside this room: it would be most unfortunate if the modest shift should be magnified into some major change of policy by financial writers, with resultant repercussions in the market. The discussion then turned to System foreign currency operations and related matters. There had been distributed to the Committee, in this connection, a report from the Special Manager of the System Open Market Account on System and Treasury operations in foreign currencies and on foreign exchange market conditions for the period May 29 through June 13, 1962, along with a supplementary report for the period June 14 through June 18, 1962. Copies of these reports have been placed in the files of the Federal Open Market Committee. 6/19/62 -41 In comments supplementing the written reports, Mr. Coombs noted that on May 31, 1962, the System had entered into a three month $50 million sterling-dollar swap with the Bank of England on terms approved by the Open Market Committee at the May 29 meeting. He added that thus far there had been no occasion to use the sterling proceeds. If and when new flows of funds to London should begin, consideration would be given--in consultation with the Bank of England--to the possibility of intervention. However, there was the question as to how fully the System should commit its limited sterling resources at an early stage in view of the possible subsequent demands upon them. It would be his present inclination not to move too rapidly. Mr. Coombs next mentioned that on Thursday, June 14, the System had entered into a three-month renewable swap agreement with the Netherlands Bank under which it bought $10 million equivalent of Netherlands guilders, with a further $40 million equivalent available on a standby basis if needed. (The final terms of swap arrangement, which had been endorsed in principle by the Open Market Committee at its May 29 meeting, were approved on June 12, 1962, upon poll of the Committee.) Mr. Coombs observed, in this connection, that shortly before the swap arrangement was executed dollar holdings of the Netherlands Bank had risen beyond the traditional ceiling of 6/19/62 -42 $200 million; if the swap had not been under negotiation, the Dutch would have ordered gold. Since the consummation of the swap, there had been an easy money market situation in Amsterdam, and the selling of rights to the Philips Lamp issue enabled the Dutch to get rid of some surplus dollars, with the result that dollar holdings had declined. The head of the Foreign Department of the Netherlands Bank was expected to arrive in New York today, and there would be discussions with him focusing particularly on the problem that would be presented by pay ment on the Philips issue, which could result in an inflow of $50 to $100 million into the Netherlands. The discussions would include whether the situation could be handled most appropriately by spot or forward operations. The Federal Reserve probably could afford to be somewhat more liberal in its use of guilders than in the case of sterling, the amount of guilder holdings being more substantial in relation to possible swings in the account of the Netherlands Bank. Mr. Coombs also mentioned that pursuant to Committee approval at the May 29 meeting, the System on June 1, 1962, renewed for a further three months the $50 million franc-dollar swap with the Bank of France, on the same terms and conditions as the original swap. The Account Management had refrained from using the System\\'s French francs pending the development of a somewhat more balanced market situation. During May, and thus far in June, flows into France had been so heavy that nothing useful could have been accomplished by utilizing the French francs. 6/19/62 -43 Mr. Coombs then noted that the System had completed negotiations with the National Bank of Belgium for a six-month $50 million Belgian franc-dollar swap. It was expected that this would be put on the books tomorrow. (This swap arrangement was approved in principle by the Committee at the May 29 meeting and was finally approved on June 18, 1962, upon poll of the Committee.) Since the May 29 meeting, the Belgians had purchased $17 million of gold, probably reflecting a corresponding inflow of dollars during that period. If further inflows should occur, he expected inquiries from the National Bank of Belgium as to whether the System wanted to mop up the inflow or would prefer that the Belgians take gold. Such a problem would have to be met on an ad hoc basis. Here again, however, the Federal Reserve holdings of Belgian francs were reasonably sizable in relation to the probable size of swings in the account of the National Bank of Belgium. Mr. Coombs reported that he had continued to discuss with the Swiss National Bank by cable and telephone the possibility of a Swiss franc-dollar swap arrangement. As mentioned at the May 29 Committee meeting, he had previously talked with the Swiss in terms of a standby swap of $150 million, with an immediate drawing of $50 million. Since the beginning of this month, and largely in reflection 6/19/62 -44- of the stock market situation, the Swiss National Bank had taken in another $75 million. Of this amount, it had been possible to fit a part under the Swiss ceiling of roughly $175 million, and the U. S. Stabilization Fund had mopped up some of the inflow. However, there remained in the hands of the Swiss National Bank holdings of dollars over and above their ceiling, which situation was putting pressure on the National Bank. The Bank\\'s management would like to move on the swap proposal but apparently was encountering certain legal difficulties. Here again, particularly in view of the willingness and desire of the National Bank to be as helpful as possible, Mr. Coombs would be inclined to make rather liberal use of the proceeds of any swap that might be negotiated. Mr. Coombs turned next to the continued heavy selling pressure on the Canadian dollar. The Bank of Canada had lost $560 million in reserves from January to May, and a heavy speculative onslaught had cost the Bank $245 million thus far this month. It had been financing the deficit by running down dollar balances and also by selling gold; the gold loss in the past month amounted to $140 million. Mr. Coombs reported that he had talked with the Governor of the Bank of Canada by telephone on three or four occasions about the possibility of a swap arrangement. The Governor had appeared 6/19/62 -45- hopeful that a move could be made on some such arrangement once the Canadian elections were over; he continued to feel that a swap of roughly $250 million would be required to have a real impact on confidence. It also appeared that the Canadians might seek recourse to a drawing on the International Monetary Fund. Unfortunately, Mr. Coombs pointed out, the results of the recent Canadian elections were not clean cut, leading to the likelihood of a coalition government. It would remain to be seen whether an effective financial program could be developed. After further comments on the Canadian situation, Mr. Coombs said he had found it difficult to decide what recommendation to make to the Committee. On balance, however, he would recommend that the Federal Reserve wait a little and see what developed, that is, whether the Canadians decided to go to the Monetary Fund and what sort of financial program they could put together, before initiating any new approach to the Bank of Canada regarding a swap. If the Bank of Canada should raise a question as to the possibility of a standby swap arrangement, it might be appropriate to inquire what the Canadians were going to do with regard to the possibility of borrowing from the Monetary Fund. The Committee might want to consider a swap arrangement only if it were part of a larger package. No disagreement was expressed with Mr. Coombs\\' recommendation. 6/19/62 -46 Mr. Coombs next reported that there had been a fair amount of selling pressure on the dollar in the Frankfurt market today. There seemed to be a speculative flow of funds into Germany, and the dollar mark rate had been driven up to $.2507 in Frankfurt this morning. The German Federal Bank had intervened this morning to the extent of $25 million, and the rate had moved to somewhat below $.2506. There had been a suggestion from the German Federal Bank by telephone that the Federal Reserve might intervene this afternoon to keep the rate from going above $.250625. Mr. Coombs thought that intervention on the basis indicated would be suitable. Therefore, unless there was some objection on the part of the Committee, he would propose to proceed in that manner. No objection on the part of the Open Market Committee was indicated. Mr. Coombs then commented briefly on developments in the London gold market and responded to certain questions in that regard. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, the System transactions in foreign currencies during the period May 29 through June 18, 1962, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, July 10, 1962. The meeting then adjourned. Assistant Secretary. ',\n",
       " 'A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held in the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington on Tuesday, October 2, 1962, at 10:00 a.m. PRESENT: Mr. Martin, Chairman Mr. Hayes, Vice Chairman Mr. Balderston Mr. Bryan Mr. Deming Mr. Ellis Mr. Fulton Mr. King Mr. Mills Mr. Mitchell Mr. Shepardson Messrs. Bopp, Scanlon, Clay, and Irons, Alternate Members of the Federal Open Market Committee Messrs.

Under date of September 18, 1962, there had been sent to each member and alternate member of the Federal Open Market Committee, and to each President not currently a member of the Committee, copies of the report of audit of the System Open Market Account and a report of audit of System foreign currency operations made by the Division of Examinations as at the close of business June 8, 1962, and submitted by Mr. Schaeffer, Chief Federal Reserve Examiner, in accordance with the action of the Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting on June 21, 1939, as reaffirmed most recently at the meeting on March 6, 1962. Copies of the reports have been placed in the files of the Committee. Chairman Martin inquired whether any of the members of the Committee had comments or questions, and there was no indication to such effect. 10/2/62 Accordingly, the audit reports were noted and accepted without objec t ion. Before this meeting there had been distributed to the members of the Committee a report on open market operations in United States Government securities covering the period September 11 through September 26, 1962, and a supplementary report covering the period September 27 through October 1, 1962. Copies of both reports have been placed in the files of the Committee. In supplementation of the written reports, Mr. Stone commented as follows: The money market during the past three weeks continued to display the generally steady atmosphere that has prevailed for the past two or three months. The effective rate on Federal funds was again at 2-3/4 or 3 per cent on every day of the period. Indeed, on looking back I find that the effective funds rate has been at 2-3/4 or 3 per cent on every day since July 26, and on all except four days since June 11. An abundance of funds continues to be available and to move through the market at those rates, although last Wednesday the supply dried up while demand expanded, and in consequence member bank borrowings rose sharply on that day. As in earlier periods, there has continued to be strong demand for short-term investments and downward pressure on bill rates despite the moderately firm atmosphere in the Federal funds market. Corporations seem to have come back into the bill market after only a temporary slackening in their buying over the tax date, and reports from the market indicate that a good corporate demand is likely to continue in the period ahead, particularly with the cash inflow to the automobile industry about to accel erate as sales of the new models get under way. Our operations over the next few days will probably put some additional down ward pressure on rates, for it appears from current reserve estimates that we may have to inject another $750 million of funds on top of the heavy purchases of recent days. The long-term market has also continued firm in the past few weeks, nourished by a feeling in the market that the 10/2/62 domestic business situation is getting no better. Also reports from the Fund and Bank meetings have suggested to the market that confidence in the dollar may have improved sufficiently so that greater weight might be given to the domestic side in the formulation of policy. This feeling has been further nurtured by market letters that have appeared recently. The Treasury\\'s announcement that it would offer about $250 million long-term bonds at competitive bidding sometime in the next six months had no impact on prices and rates in the market, but did send banks and dealers into an immediate flurry of activity in efforts to organize bidding syndicates. The Treasury\\'s projected technique has been a prime topic of dis cussion during the past two weeks, and out of that discussion have emerged a number of significant questions and problems. One of the more important of these problems is the possibility that bidders, for prestige purposes, will seriously overprice the issue--an action that could destroy the new technique in its infancy. Another question raised by the market involves the 4-1/4 per cent statutory interest rate ceiling and whether the Treasury would be prepared to accept a bid priced to pro vide a yield in excess of 4-1/4 per cent. Still another pro blem is that of reasonable balance in the strength of the competing syndicates. Finally, the problem that most directly concerns the System is the one outlined in Mr. Keir\\'s memorandum--whether the Committee would undertake its customary even-keel approach, or more or less than that approach, during a financing underwritten by a syndicate. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities during the period September 11 through October 1, 1962, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. The economic review at this meeting consisted of a visual auditory presentation for which Messrs. Garfield, Reynolds, Axilrod, and Altmann of the Board\\'s staff joined the meeting. Copies of the script of the economic review and the related charts have been placed in the files of the Committee. 10/2/62 The introductory portion of the economic review, presented by Mr. Noyes, was as follows: At the time of the last visual presentation to this Committee, on June 19, many analysts were revising their forecasts of economic activity downward. Current activity, as reflected in industrial production data through May and a GNP estimate for the second quarter, was continuing to rise. For some time, however, the rate of advance had been much less rapid than in the first six months of recovery and appre ciably less rapid than rates incorporated in earlier projections. The latest figures available for retail trade, those for April and May, were above earlier levels, but the course of consumer buying over the whole recovery period was widely regarded as erratic and to some extent disappointing. Moreover, some of the series which often have moved early in cycles were pointing downward. In particular, stock prices had declined dramatically and many analysts were not wholly satisfied that this decline represented merely an overdue reap praisal of values. Concern over balance of payments problems was being intensified by the Canadian dollar crisis. While it was generaly recognized that the recovery and expansion period which began after February 1961 was still young, by usual standards, there was increasing discussion of the possible need for early action to stimulate demand--and specifically concerning a general tax cut. Against the uncertain expectations of last June, the developments of mid-summer appeared favorable enough so that the idea of an immediate general tax cut did not prevail. Industrial production rose a full point in July to 119, and the unemployment rate was down a little from the 5-1/2 per cent level reported earlier in the year. Retail trade and manufacturers\\' new orders for durable goods both rose sharply in July. The stock price decline had ended in late June and by mid-August stock prices had recovered nearly 40 per cent of their previous loss. Altogether, business developments reported for July were almost too good to be true and could hardly have been expected to be followed immediately by further marked gains. Actually, industrial production and retail trade in August showed little change from their advanced July levels. Unemployment rose in August, and a preliminary report just received indicates that it remained at about the same level in September, emphasizing 10/2/62 the continuing underutilization of resources. Steel produc tion currently is still under 60 per cent of capacity despite some advance in August and September. In the stock market, renewed weakness has appeared in the past 10 days and yesterday prices closed 5 per cent below the mid-September level. This recent decline has been from levels nearly a fifth below the high of last December and may reflect in larger degree than before concern over business prospects. For the third quarter, the present estimate of GNP is $557 billion, a modest rise of $5 billion from the second quarter. There followed sections dealing with balance of payments devel opments; production, resource use, and prices; demand factors; and financial developments. The concluding portion of the economic review, presented by Mr. Koch, was as follows: These more or less quarterly chart show presentations give the staff an opportunity to present a somewhat longer view of economic and financial developments, both at home and abroad, than can be given in our usual tri-weekly reports. Therefore in conclusion today, let us try to summarize some of these longer run developments insofar as they provide background material for current bank credit and monetary decisions. First, as to domestic business conditions, economic activity, after having surpassed the pre-recession level quickly, has risen more slowly this year, particularly since spring. Second, for the first time in the postwar period, expan sion in activity has not been accompanied at any stage by rising industrial commodity prices. Moreover, wage increases have been much more moderate than in earlier expansions. In world markets, raw material prices have been under downward pressure. Third, at the present time available resources of both labor and capital are not being utilized as fully as would be possible without creating upward pressure on prices. Fourth, current business inventory holdings appear modest in relation to sales, and the current rate of in ventory accumulation is not high. 10/2/62 Fifth, total business outlays on new plant and equip ment are now rising very slowly. Such expenditures continue to be a considerably smaller proportion of the GNP than in the early postwar expansions, when production was closer to capacity. Sixth, the Government\\'s share of the increase in final demands has been somewhat larger than in the previous period of cyclical expansion for the whole upswing, although Govern ment fiscal action has not had much of a net stimulative effect on the economy in the last two quarters. Tax reduc tions and additional tax reforms, however, are generally expected next year, possibly early in the year. Turning to the balance of payments situation, we find that although the over-all deficit has been gradually reduced since 1960, it remains uncomfortably large. In the first nine months of this year, it was at an annual rate of about $1-3/4 billion, and would have been at about a $2-1/2 billion rate if substantial debt prepayments had not been received. Second, the 1962 deficit has involved a gold loss larger than that of 1961, though smaller than in 1958 or 1960. The amount of gold purchased by foreign countries continues to depend a good deal on which specific countries are gain ing reserves as well as on the size of our deficit. Third, net capital outflows have not been running quite as large so far this year as they were in 1960 and 1961, mainly because there has been no further Japanese short-term borrowing from U. S. commercial banks since March. Fourth, two encouraging facts for the longer run are that in recent years our price behavior has been more favorable than that in competing industrial countries, and that more ample reserves abroad should permit leading for eign countries to admit U. S. goods more freely and to relax their capital market controls. Turning to domestic financial developments, there has been a rather sharp expansion in commercial bank credit and total bank deposits thus far this year. This result has re presented sharp increases in time, savings, and Government deposits rather than demand deposits. Thus, the narrowly defined money supply has actually declined a little. Second, the recent posture of monetary policy, coupled with moderate private and Government demands for financing and a large flow of savings, has been reflected in reasonably stable interest rates. Short-term rates are about 1/4 to 1/2 per cent above, and long-term rates about 1/4 per cent below, their levels at the beginning of the year. 10/2/62 Third, increases in private debt have been much more moderate this time than in other cyclical upswings, and consumers and businesses are in a fairly liquid, although certainly not an excessively liquid, position. Fourth, stock prices are being more realistically appraised, and the events of the past ten days indicate that the reappraisal process is still under way with uncertain ties concerning business prospects probably more of a factor this fall than in the spring. These, it seems to us, are among the most important economic and financial facts to be weighed in reaching mone tary policy decisions. To attempt an even more capsule conclusion, domestic activity continues sluggish, while the international balance is improving only slowly. The business situation is again poised at dead center. After earlier pauses, expansion soon set in. This time, with the expansion still young, the next move may again be up, but there appears to be more possibility than before that the country will soon be entering a recessionary period--once again long before the recovery from the last recession has enabled us to realize our potential in terms of manpower and other resource utilization. Monetary policy continues to be mildly stimulative domestically and mildly restraining to short-term capital flows internationally. The irreducible policy question remains with us: would additional monetary ease stimulate the domestic economy without hampering the balance of pay ments improvement that is in process? No doubt the gains to be had from further easing of policy would carry with them some hazards. It is also possible that under present circumstances additional stimulation might more appropriately come from fiscal rather than monetary policy. In this con nection, the time required to make policy effective is, of course, one consideration; the impact on balance of payment problems is another. Judgments as to the most appropriate monetary policy will depend, as always, on the weighing of many elements in the situation and in the nature of the case must be based on appraisals of prospects by no means certain. Mr. Hayes presented the following statement of his views on the economic situation and monetary policy: 10/2/62 The domestic business situation, although not greatly changed since our last meeting, is if anything a shade less encouraging. The complete August statistics now available suggest even a mild downward tilt in that month, but it would seem unwise to stress this in view of the widespread downward influence of the August changeover in auto models. September data are too flimsy to establish a trend. As for quarterly data, preliminary third quarter estimates suggest that GNP rose at about the same rate as in the preceding two quarters, but much less rapidly than in the first three quarters of recovery in 1961. Although inventory investment explained much of the slowdown, with final demand behaving rather well, the really striking fact since the 1961 trough is the relative lack of vigor in business fixed investment. The latter is of course importantly associated with the fact that the economy is considerably further from full capacity operations than in the last strong expansion, that of 1954-57, and perhaps also with inadequate profit margins and a feeling of uncertainty among businessmen as to the Government\\'s underlying attitude towards business. Business sentiment has not been helped recently by the persistent weakness in stock prices. Despite the spate of cheerful press articles and official comments on the balance of payments, it seems to me that our international problems remain as serious as ever. The one encouraging element has been the calm state of the exchange and gold markets prevailing in the past month or so and enhanced by a Bank-Fund meeting that was notably lacking in scare-talk on the dollar\\'s status. On the other hand, much of this favorable psychology rests on the belief that the United States is making steady progress towards a solution of its balance of payments problem--and if the published statistics for the third quarter fail to bear this out, disappointment could lead to a quick turn for the worse in foreign views concerning the dollar. It now looks as if the third quarter deficit may be at an annual rate of about $2.5 billion, and in the absence of special debt prepayments this rate might have been as high as $4 billion. We may be lucky to achieve a full year over-all deficit as low as $2 billion, as compared with $2.5 billion in 1961, and in contrast with various official forecasts for 1962 in the $1 to $1.5 billion range. Thus the improvement in the balance of payments this year seems likely to be pretty modest, despite all of the Government\\'s laudable 10/2/62 -10- efforts to reduce various drains on our international payments; and we seem to be still a long way from the announced goal of basic balance by the end of 1963. Higher imports have been the principal factor nullifying our efforts in other areas, but capital outflows--both short and long term--have also been important. I can see reasonable hope that balance will be achieved in time, in view of the contrasting cost trends now apparent here and in Europe; but the grave question is whether confidence in the dollar as a reserve currency can be maintained while balance is gradually being attained. Time may be running out for us. I don\\'t think recent credit developments are particularly noteworthy. The data for reporting banks in recent weeks seem to bear out the view of many bank lending officers that there is no great strength in loan demand. As for all the figures on money supply and liquidity, and on reserves in relation to guidelines, I believe that they are sufficiently affected by special factors to lend them selves to highly contradictory interpretations and to use in support of almost any monetary policy; but I am impressed by the common-sense argument that bankers in many parts of the country are eagerly seeking to make loans, and that this readiness to lend money is having some appreciable effect on the flow of capital to foreign countries. Several European central bankers have recently commented on such activities of the American banks. Whether even greater liquidity than the present rather adequate liquidity level would contribute much to further economic expansion, I am inclined to doubt. If there were no restraining international considerations, it might be worth experimenting in this direction in view of the rather soggy domestic outlook, even though I do not believe mone tary policy would supply the needed answer. But with the balance of payments problem as serious as I believe it to be, the risks inherent in an easier monetary policy are clearly too great. At the very least we should try to encourage as firm a short-term rate structure as has pre vailed in recent weeks, and preferably a little firmer, i.e., with Federal funds at 3 per cent most of the time and with 90-day bill rates well above 2-3/4 per cent. Purchases of intermediate and long-term securities might well be used to the greatest extent practicable in supplying seasonal reserves needed in the coming weeks. Perhaps this is about 10/2/62 -11- as far as we can go today in view of the uncertain domestic outlook--but I have an uneasy feeling that our problem will not become easier as the weeks pass. Unfortunately, we shall have \"even keel\" considerations to deal with from late October through much of November. I see no need to change the directive or to consider a discount rate change for the time being. It does seem to me that the \"box\" we find ourselves in is due at least in part to the Government\\'s reluctance to use fiscal policy promptly and flexibly to deal with some of the demonstrated weaknesses in our domestic economy. I realize that it has been a long-standing tradition for the System to be quite reticent on appropriate fiscal policy, but I believe the time has come to abandon that reticence. The interrelationship between monetary and fiscal policy is so close that I don\\'t see how we can avoid such a conclusion; and incidentally I have seen no evidence of great reluctance on the Administration\\'s part to take quite positive positions in the matter of appropriate policies with respect to inter est rates and other monetary matters. In my judgment a vigorous and flexible fiscal policy would greatly ease our domestic difficulties and would enable the System to cope much more effectively with our perplexing international responsibilities. If the Committee shares this opinion, I hope that a spokesman for the System will find suitable opportunities to make this view heard. Mr. Bryan presented the following statement: Nearly all of the new figures for the Sixth District are for August. Nearly all of them indicate a slight weakening of the economic situation in the District. Manufacturing employment, retail sales as measured by department store sales, bank debits, and average weekly hours are down. In sured unemployment is up. Speaking in general, there seems to me little difference between the behavior of the Sixth District and national economic behavior. We may find, of course, that this pattern is merely the sort of seesaw that has become commonplace in recent months. At the same time, we must be alert to the possibility of an early end to the expansionary phase of the present business cycle. We are still confronted with the conceptual and definitional problems with regard to the money supply, prob lems that have been so difficult now for so long a time. At any rate we do face a situation in which the money supply, 10/2/62 -12- conventionally defined, has moved down, and the rate of growth in time deposits has slowed, so that a given volume of reserves will apparently support a smaller expansion in the total of bank credit. We must likewise face a recent small increase in member bank borrowing and an approach to some upper limit in the growth of deposit turnover. In the light of this situation, we can answer our policy problems partly by elimination. We must certainly eliminate any idea that banks should be compelled to sell assets in a futile attempt to gain the reserves that are necessary for credit expansion. I believe we must eliminate any idea what ever of reducing the reserve base. That leaves us with the positive problem of how much we do in supplying reserves to the banking system. In striving to answer that problem, I believe we must conclude that our reserve supplies must be fully equal to the seasonal expansion. For October that would require us to add approximately $57 million to the reserve supply at a minimum. It can easily be argued that we should add more because of deficits from our projections. Next, we must certainly add a supply of reserves for a growth factor in the economy. At 3 per cent, which I regard as a minimum in present circumstances, we should need an additional $50 million. How then do I come out in the matter of an instruction to the Desk? Well, if we take the October trend line at 3 per cent, it figures to $19,936 million. If we add $107 million for seasonal expansion and for a growth factor, we come out (using total reserves) at $20,043 million for October. 1/ Put a plus or minus $50 million or so for latitude to the Desk, and you would have my instruction. I should add that I would make errors on the side of sup plying more rather than less reserves. I should certainly make the error on that side if there is any tendency for member bank borrowing to increase. The figures I have given can be reconciled with a free reserve figure, but the assumptions necessary for any such reconciliation are so many as to make the attempt a bit futile in my judgment. In any case, though, I believe that 1/ Since the average daily balance of total reserves September 1-28 is $20,042 million, this policy recom mendation is essentially \"no change.\" 10/2/62 -13- to attain the total reserve figure I judge appropriate to our present circumstances will almost certainly require a free reserve figure of between $400 and $500 million. It will be noticed that I say nothing about the level of short-term rates. The omission is intentional. I think we are rapidly approaching the time when we shall be compelled to make the soul-searching choice between the domestic economy and our balance of payments. My own choice is clear to the Committee. Moreover, I believe it is time for us to stop, or consider stopping, our stately minuet- maybe stately is the wrong word--with the bill rate. Accord ingly, if we write an appropriate prescription of reserves for the domestic economy, we shall be compelled, I believe, to let rates go where they will. This does not, I note, preclude our dealing in securities other than bills. Mr. Bryan then offered the following suggestion with respect to the current policy directive, stating that it was presented with a view to indicating what he thought might be done by way of quantitative instruction to the Desk and not with the expectation that it would be adopted by the Committee: It is the current policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to supply the reserves necessary for an expan sion of bank credit without the restraining influence arising from an increase in member bank borrowing. The purpose of the Committee is to provide a credit base suf ficient for a continuing expansion of the economy. The Federal Open Market Committee believes its policy can be effectuated in October by supplying approximately $57 million of reserves for seasonal expansion and approxi mately $50 million of reserves for a growth factor, which is at an annual rate of 3 per cent. The Committee thus directs the Manager of the Open Market Account to aim for a figure of $20,043 million of total reserves for October on an average daily basis, with latitude to the Manager of the Account to operate around this figure in accordance with money market developments. However, if there is a tendency for interest rates generally to increase or member bank borrowing generally to increase, the Committee believes that the Manager of 10/2/62 -14- the Account should increase the figure indicated in this directive as a general target by an amount tending to off set the pressures on the banking system arising from an increase of member bank borrowing. Mr. Bopp presented the following statement: Three weeks ago we characterized Third District business as generally lacking in vigor. Nothing has since happened to change this assessment. Manufacturing employment, hours, and output are sagging. Recent declines in unemployment rates were of less than seasonal proportions. Strength in depart ment store sales so far this September is more apparent than real, being based on comparisons with a poor month last year. Bank loans are continuing to rise in our District, with loans to sales finance companies, other financial institutions, and real estate loans pacing the advance. Business loans have continued to increase, but at a slower rate than earlier in the year. Demand deposits have shown little trend recently, but time deposits, after a long period of sustained expansion, have leveled off. We continue to believe that an easier monetary policy would be effective in stimulating the domestic economy. As recent meetings of the Committee indicate, judgments differ as to the current availability of credit. Some believe that credit is now available in quantities adequate to support an increase in economic activity if the demand for it were to appear. Others believe still readier availability would facilitate economic expansion. It is clear, however, that an easier monetary policy can produce greater liquidity in the economy whether or not there is an increased demand for bank credit via loans. Open market operations can by themselves generate larger deposit balances because they would be invested. If, by increasing liquidity, monetary policy can have a stimulative effect during early phases of expansion, it remains to be demonstrated why further liquidity may not continue to stimulate. The effect may be marginal (and perhaps a declin ing margin), but this is all we are seeking. The real question concerns not the ability to increase liquidity but the advisability of doing so. Given the balance of payments problem, we cannot, of course, play fast and loose with liquidity. But it seems possible now that the balance of payments is improving and exchange markets have become more stable to move cautiously in the direction of more ease. 10/2/62 -15 Making allowance for periods of Treasury financing, we would interpret such a position as meaning somewhat lower market rates and somewhat larger reserve totals. We should like to see the seasonal needs for funds supplied without any significant pressure in the market, and would welcome an increase in the money supply. If this policy were adopted, some rewording of the directive, along the line of that of May 29, 1962, would be appropriate. We would not change the discount rate. Mr. Fulton said that most of the August dip in economic activity in the Fourth District appeared to have been recouped during the first three weeks of September. Department store sales increased, and it looked as though this month they might regain their all-time high. For the year to date they were 3 per cent ahead of last year. Sales of new cars were displaying more than seasonal weakness, possibly due to the lack of availability of some models. Construction was down in both Cincinnati and Cleveland and remained at the reduced level of August. Unemployment had shown no significant change since July. As might be expected, most of the steel centers had the greatest percentage of unemployment. However, in conversations around the District, manu facturers did not seem to feel that the outlook was too dismal. Instead, there seemed to be a rather good feeling about the level of business in practically all industries. The automobile people were optimistic, the chemical industry was good, and the paper container industry was good. The situation might be characterized as \"nervous stability.\" The machine tool industry was one that was not in good shape. Order backlogs were being reduced, and foreign orders had been falling off due to the ability of European plants to speed up their deliveries. 10/2/62 -16 Some corporations reportedly were restricting plant and equipment spending until next year, if then, with the idea of finding out what kind of tax revisions might be instituted. However, spending for the purpose of keeping plants competitive was continuing. In the steel industry there had been some pickup in orders, but from a very low level. Orders for pipe were not doing well, reflecting in part the completion of several large transmission lines. On the other hand, orders were now coming in from the auto industry for November and December delivery. Fourth quarter production seemed likely to show modest improvement. The third quarter total would be less than had been projected earlier, and total production for the year was estimated at about 98 million tons. The outlook for next year was 95 - 96 million tons. The union had declared that it was going to ask for more money through reopening the present labor contract; the steel companies indicated there would be nothing for them to do except face a strike. If the unions persisted in statements of the kind they were now making, there would be a build-up of inventories in the early part of next year, with a probable letdown in the second half. Bank loans had been increasing in the District, with the increase in term loans rather marked. Apparently there were sufficient funds available to the banking system to permit the banks to make all of the loans they legitimately should make. In fact, the banks were reaching for loans. 10/2/62 -17 Mr. Fulton said he did not feel that, in the present circum stances, there should be any increase in reserve availability. In stead, an \"even keel\" would be desirable. In other words, he would favor maintaining about the same market tone that had prevailed during the past three weeks, while keeping an eye on the short-term rate. He would not change the discount rate. In the period from now until the end of this year, Mr. Fulton added, the System would be required to supply a substantial amount of reserves on a seasonal basis. In his opinion, consideration should be given to a reduction of reserve requirements, which would provide a means of injecting a quantity of reserves without direct impact on short-term rates. He understood it had been a general objective to reduce reserve requirements as opportunities presented themselves, and the situation he had mentioned seemed to provide one of those opportuni ties. Mr. Mitchell expressed the view that the Committee should adopt a policy of greater ease, and that this should be implemented by operations in the intermediate market. Government securities dealers had a good supply of intermediate-term securities that he presumed could be tapped by the System. Maintenance of the level of short-term rates, through efforts of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, had resulted in abnormalities that would cause trouble if a certain course of developments should take place. In view of the international 10/2/62 -18 situation, the Committee could not afford to ignore the trend of short-term rates. Nevertheless, it should expect them to go down. It could not operate in the longer-term market without effects on the short-term rate. The directive should be modified, if only to indicate that the Committee was aware of the widely-held view that the country might be facing an imminent recession. It should not appear from the directive that the Committee was unaware of that view. Mr. Mitchell went on to say that his position on monetary policy was not based on month-to-month changes in business activity. Instead, it was based on the relationship of business activity to productive capacity. As long as the economy was operating well below reasonable levels of capacity, monetary policy should be expansionary, and in his opinion it had not been adequately expansionary. The view that fiscal policy probably could do the job better was a view to which he subscribed. Probably other methods could also deal better than monetary policy with the balance of payments problem. However, this did not mean that the System should refrain from doing anything it could to be helpful. In essence, he came out at about the same position that he had expressed at recent Committee meetings. He continued to advocate a policy of somewhat more ease. Mr. King said the economic presentation today tended to confirm certain thoughts that had been developing in his mind over a period of 10/2/62 -19 months. It appeared that the business cycles in this country had been shortening, and that the peaks and valleys had been moderating. If this was to be expected, what did it suggest in terms of monetary policy? To him it suggested that the old benchmarks, reference points, and guidelines probably were becoming obsolete. It suggested more moderate shifts of policy from one side to the other during both the expansionary and contractionary phases of the cycle. In his view, Mr. King said, the recent increase in time deposits represented a concealed increase in the money supply, and the money supply would increase if the banks started reducing their rates of interest on time and savings deposits. Already there were some reports of actual or contemplated reductions. Therefore, he was not too concerned about the conventionally-defined money supply. However, he believed that the policy directive needed to be changed. The words indicated that the Committee had been doing certain things in regard to the money supply that the record would show it had not actually been doing. According to the directive, the Committee\\'s policy was to permit a further increase in the money supply, whereas the narrowly defined money supply had been static or contracting. In general, he leaned away from the idea of changing the directive in the absence of some change in monetary policy. In this instance, however, he felt that some change was in order. Mr. King also commented that he would not be too concerned if the bill rate should decline somewhat, even as low as 2-1/2 per cent. 10/2/62 -20 There was such a thing as overstaying a position, and in his opinion that may have been true in this instance. Therefore, he would not object if less emphasis was placed on the bill rate, not forgetting it entirely but not being so concerned about maintaining the rate as during the past several months. In summary, Mr. King said, he would not recommend any real easing of monetary policy. The country had been going through a period in which substantial overcapacity had developed. He had seen this occur in industries of which he had direct knowledge, and he did not believe that the availability of more credit at lower rates was a material corrective factor. If he thought it was a material factor, he would be inclined to move somewhat in the direction of greater ease, but there was too much to lose by pumping more liquidity into the economy at this stage. However, he would not be too concerned about the bill rate unless it reached substantially lower levels than at present. Mr. Shepardson said he saw nothing in the staff report to indicate any significant change in the level of economic activity, although there may have been some slowing down statistically in the rate of advance. Nor did he find any evidence of an insufficiency of funds to meet worthy credit demands. At the recent meeting of the Board of Governors with the Federal Advisory Council, several Council members commented to the effect that there was a considerable supply 10/2/62 -21- of funds for which lenders were vigorously seeking profitable uses. Similar comments were heard from other sources. In light of this situation, and with the understanding that the System would meet seasonal reserve needs liberally, it seemed to him that current monetary policy was appropriate. Mr. Shepardson noted that there had been suggestions today and at recent Committee meetings that a somewhat easier monetary policy might stimulate the utilization of idle productive resources. It was necessary, he thought, to have in mind certain fundamental factors that could have a greater bearing on longer run economic growth, and in this connection he presented the following statement: We have been concerned for some time about our two-fold but inseparable problem of less than full employment of our domestic resources and the persisting adverse balance of pay ments. In my opinion, one root cause of both these problems was the inflationary wage-cost-price spiral that plagued much of the postwar era. It hurt our ability to compete in for eign markets. It inflated domestic costs so much that profit margins and profit expectations were squeezed, thereby dis couraging higher levels of business investment. In the past four years we have moved a long way toward checking this spiral. As Mr. Mitchell pointed out at our last meeting, if the economy is not yet in an ideal position as far as the wage-price spiral is concerned, it is better off in this respect than it has been for a long time. I agree, but the wage pressure still exists. Internationally, our relative competitive position seems to be improving, and producers are increasing their efforts to sell in attractive foreign markets. Along with a change of governmental policies concerning spending, loans, and grants abroad, these develop ments underlie the gradual improvement that has taken place in our basic balance of trade. Domestically, we have largely disposed of inflationary price expectations, maintained a reasonably prosperous level of business, made some resources 10/2/62 -22- freer to shift to more efficient uses, increased the flow of savings to accommodate productive investment, and thus laid the groundwork for additional investment if and when private concerns become attracted by today\\'s prospects for lower hut perhaps more stable profits. I think the prudent monetary policy we have followed has had a good deal to do with this improvement in the fundamental economic health of our country. But many of these adjustments are still in process and others, includ ing some revision of tax and fiscal policy to improve in vestment incentive, are still needed. Hence it is important that monetary policy not retard or alleviate the pressure for the completion of this transition. To me this implies money readily available to finance soundly based economic activity, but not so easy as to finance diversionary activities, speculation, or continuation of outmoded or overextended operations, While greater credit availability, more liquidity, and lower interest rates might encourage various shifts in types of borrowing and kinds of asset holdings, they are not likely to stimulate much additional spending by consumers and busi ness, for most such outlays are in response to other and over riding considerations. For example, somewhat greater monetary ease might create some mild tendency for businesses to hold fewer liquid assets and somewhat more inventory. While it is possible that such a shift at this time might speed up the momentum of general business advance, I am inclined to think that any such influence would be very mild and short-lived, and the subsequent letdown could very possibly come at a time which would aggravate deflationary pressures developing from other sources. At the same time the increased credit avail ability and lower interest rates likely to result from an easier money policy could easily trigger renewed capital out flows abroad, shaking the newly buttressed confidence in the dollar. Viewed in this perspective, it seems to me that the few marginal gains possible from even a moderately easier monetary policy are more than offset by its immediate hazards. More importantly, the possible effects of such easing, in creating some temporary additional demands, might well slow or divert the fundamental adjustments now taking place that are so essential to the long-run health of our economy. It seems to me that in the present situation, and with the long-run concept in mind, current monetary policy is appropriate. I would suggest no change. 10/2/62 -23 Mr. Mills commented that he would not recommend a change in the discount rate. He was not particularly optimistic about economic pros pects. However, any change in the policy directive at the present time that might indicate acceptance of the probability of slower economic activity would imply a greater shift in open market policy than he thought would be justified. His concept of an appropriate monetary and credit policy could be carried out within the context of the present directive if open market operations were aimed at producing the levels of free reserves that had developed in the first two weeks of the period since the preceding Committee meeting, and if they sought to avoid an abrupt contraction such as occurred in the third week. He regarded that contraction as vitiating the potential beneficial effects that were inherent in the reserve statistics of the first two weeks of the period. He shared Mr. Mitchell\\'s concern about the fixation on maintaining a stable structure of interest rates because, under cover of that assumed stability, he believed there were pressures and dis tortions building up that could constitute a serious hindrance to a flexible Federal Reserve policy in the weeks and months to come. His further comments, Mr. Mills said, would touch on those same factors and in a sense were a prelude to the subject that Mr. Keir of the Board\\'s staff had discussed in his paper (distributed to the Open Market Committee under date of October 1, 1962); that is, the question whether the System should support the long-term Government 10/2/62 -24- bond market during the underwriting period of the Treasury\\'s forth coming offer of $250 million of long-term bonds for competitive bidding by private syndicates. He thought it was a certainty that the System would be involved in a peg if it drifted into acceptance of any invitation to give support to the Treasury\\'s new program. Mr. Mills then presented the following statement: The unusually high levels of U. S. Treasury balances in its Tax and Loan Account depositories and in the posi tions of U. S. Government securities dealers have originated from Federal Reserve System policy actions intended to pre vent short-term interest rates from falling too low and long-term interest rates from rising too high. Each of these situations is the offspring of official actions that have interfered with the free interplay of natural forces in the U. S. Government securities market and have made the attainment of the policy objectives sought after more, rather than less, difficult. In the case of the U. S. Treasury\\'s abnormally high Tax and Loan Account balances, funds have been abstracted from the general money flows by increased offerings of short-term U. S. Government securities, the greater supply of which was aimed at bolstering short-term interest rates. The funds impounded through this policy would have served better economic and financial purposes if they had been retained in private hands and a downward pressure on the money supply would have been avoided. Their release and return now into private money flows would, to a certain extent, strengthen the basis for bank credit expansion, thereby lessening the need for seasonal purchases of U. S. Government securities for the System Open Market Account with a resulting unwanted downward pressure on short-term interest yields. Action of this kind would be a desirable step away from artificial market interference and what has become a market pegging operation. The exceptionally high positions of the U. S. Govern ment securities dealers are likewise a product of official interference in the U. S. Government securities market. In observing the avowed interest rate objectives of Federal Reserve System policy makers and the consequent effects of their price pegging operations, the dealers have developed 10/2/62 -25 confidence in the permanence of the present interest rate structure that has encouraged an expansion of their posi tions for profit motives rather than out of any acknowledged responsibility for making markets in U. S. Government secu rities. If a large part of dealer inventories had not been held off the market but had moved into investor holdings, an upward pressure on short-term interest rates would have been exerted that in turn would have simplified the management of Federal Reserve System policy. The complications to the conduct of a viable Federal Reserve System policy that are inherent in artificial inter ventions in the U. S. Government securities market are apparent in the two situations discussed. I repeat my belief that every opportunity should be taken for again developing Federal Reserve System policy along free market lines that are geared largely to a \"bills only\" principle. Mr. Wayne reported that statistics, supplemented by the Richmond Reserve Bank\\'s own survey, indicated that Fifth District business had not deviated significantly from its generally level course. A few areas had continued to weaken, and the District\\'s extensive textile industry headed this list. But improvements elsewhere had thus far tended to offset the declines. Business activity nationally, it seemed to him, declined slightly in August. While this might represent nothing more than a continuation of the recent zig-zag movement around a gently rising trend, he found it somewhat disturbing that the improvement realized in July was not sustained. As for the immediate future, he saw no substantial reason for believing that the fall upturn this year would be much better than seasonal. In considering policy, it seemed to Mr. Wayne that recent for eign developments might deserve special attention at this time Foreign 10/2/62 -26 money markets had eased significantly in recent weeks, and the impend ing reduction in special deposits in Britain suggested some further easing in the weeks ahead. For this and other reasons, the dollar had lately shown encouraging strength against the major European currencies. This situation raised the question whether, for domestic purposes, a somewhat easier policy could safely be followed. He was inclined to be skeptical on this point for several reasons. In the first place, he was not altogether sure there was any real substance underlying the dollar\\'s recent strength, especially in view of the estimates respecting the balance of payments deficit in August. In the second place, he doubted that the additional amount of ease permitted by the dollar\\'s new strength could provide any significant domestic stimulus. Finally, he believed it was wiser for the present to allow the dol lar\\'s new strength, whether temporary or permanent, to be reflected primarily in a reduced balance of payments deficit. This would strengthen foreign confidence in our policies and place the dollar on a firmer basis abroad. It would also give us a freer hand to direct our actions more specifically at the domestic situation if this should become more urgent later this fall. For these reasons, he would favor maintenance of about the degree of ease that had been aimed at over the past few periods, with the Desk giving major attention to the tone and color of the market. 10/2/62 -27 Three weeks ago, Mr. Wayne recalled, he had proposed a slight change in the directive to eliminate reference to \"further\" increase in the money supply. He renewed this proposal. Otherwise, no change in the directive seemed desirable. He would recommend no change in the discount rate. Mr. Clay suggested that the Committee modify its monetary policy by giving somewhat less emphasis to international payments considerations and somewhat greater emphasis to the problem of domestic economic activity. For many months, he noted, monetary policy had been shaped in terms of both domestic and international considerations. In determining the policy to be pursued, Committee members had referred to the relative emphasis that should be given to these two aspects. It was in pursuing the matter in this way, for instance, that the decision was made last June to reduce the degree of monetary ease by giving greater weight to the international payments problem. In the meantime, the international balance of payments problem generally had come to be viewed somewhat more favorably. The inter national payments situation and prospects had to be judged not only in terms of the interpretation of the available data but also in terms of the prevailing international attitude. Both of these facets of the problem had shown improvement recently, just as both registered the earlier deterioration that the Committee decided it had to deal with. This was not to say that the international payments problem had been solved and accordingly could be ignored. 10/2/62 -28 At the same time, Mr. Clay pointed out, the domestic economic situation had become less encouraging. It had become increasingly difficult to project a satisfactory degree of economic expansion ahead, and the possibility of another abortive upswing such as that in 1960 loomed larger month by month. The problem of resource utilization that plagued the economy very likely involved something more fundamental than the course of this business cycle. Moreover, it would be naive to assume that the cure for all our ills could be found in any prescription of monetary policy alone. But that was not to deny the importance of monetary policy making its appropriate contribution and of endeavoring to assure that monetary policy did not impede but rather encouraged economic expansion. Mr. Clay noted that his suggestion for a change in emphasis between international and domestic considerations and for a greater degree of monetary ease was a very moderate one. It might be stated as a policy under which reserve funds would be supplied liberally enough to assure bank credit expansion beyond seasonal proportions and under which operations would probe toward a slightly lower Treasury bill rate. In the process, it could be expected that interest rates would decline in the longer maturities as well, and that would be a desirable development. In fact, that tendency should be encouraged by making some open market purchases in those maturities. If, in the Committee\\'s judgment, the Treasury bill rate could not be permitted to 10/2/62 -29 decline, it would be all the more important that open market operations be conducted in longer maturities with a view to en couraging some reduction in longer term interest rates in that way. No change was recommended in the Reserve Bank discount rate. Mr. Scanlon said available evidence for September indicated continuation of business activity in the Seventh District at a stable or gradually rising level. While some businessmen expected a reces sion beginning in the fourth quarter of this year or early 1963, the more generally held view was that the present level of activity would be maintained or that there would be a slight improvement during the remainder of this year. During the summer months there had been some decline in District manufacturing activity. Part of this was attri butable to the closing down of automobile plants for the model changeover, but other lines of activity also were affected. One important industry, radio-television, cut back production sharply to reduce inventories. At present the automobile industry was awaiting public reaction to the new models before making further forecasts. In the real estate field, there was some concern that apartment construc tion might be approaching a peak. New units were more difficult to rent, even with substantial concessions. A number of large commercial structures planned for the Chicago area had been delayed, if not can celed, because sufficient floor space could not be leased in advance. Retail trade was following the national pattern; for the four weeks 10/2/62 -30 ended September 22, department store sales were 8 per cent above last year. As the result of excellent crops and favorable prices, farm income was going to exceed last year\\'s level, and it appeared that the higher level of income was likely to be maintained in 1963. Business loan demand improved somewhat in the first three weeks of September. In view of the continued stability of business activity at a level moderately below what he considered desirable, Mr. Scanlon sug gested that reserves be provided liberally to meet seasonal needs. Beyond this, it would seem appropriate to provide additional reserves to the extent that this could be done without excessive stimulation of capital flows abroad. In the absence of a sufficiently strong demand for capital, this presented the possibility of a further decline in bill rates. He would be inclined to let the bill rate decline slightly, but he would continue to keep a close watch on domestic and international developments. Mr. Scanlon concluded by saying that he would not recommend changing the discount rate or the policy directive. Mr. Deming reported that the Ninth District continued to move along fairly well. Economic activity had expanded more in the first three quarters of this year than the comparable period of 1961, due to greater output of manufactured products and minerals along with a better agricultural situation. A near-record small grain crop was being harvested. There had been no significant changes in employment 10/2/62 -31 in recent months. Preliminary Minnesota employment figures for September showed a slight gain from August, with unemployment down somewhat. The Reserve Bank\\'s most recent survey of business sentiment showed no substantial change from the results of the survey taken six weeks earlier. Two-thirds of the respondents felt that some improve ment was probable during the next several weeks, while one-fourth looked for stability and less than 10 per cent looked for a decline. The percentage anticipating a decline was slightly higher than six weeks previously, but not significantly higher. During September there was a large loan increase at city banks, with a substantial part of the increase in business loans. Demand deposits were growing rapidly at both city and country banks. Time deposit growth had slowed at city banks, but such deposits were still running 50 per cent ahead of last year. At country banks, time deposit growth continued at the rate that had prevailed thus far this year. Mr. Deming said it seemed to him there had been a worsening of the balance of payments problem recently, but at the same time some increase in confidence in the dollar. The present situation might afford a little more latitude with regard to the bill rate than had been thought possible in the recent past. However, the liquidity of the banking system, and of the economy generally, appeared ample. Banks were working hard to make loans, and with a reasonable amount 10/2/62 -32 of success in the Ninth District. There seemed no reason to make the banks sell assets in order to expand their loans, or to cause them to borrow. In his opinion, however, a loan expansion without such results could be achieved under current monetary policy, and he would favor maintaining about the same posture as at present. He would meet seasonal reserve needs adequately, perhaps generously and somewhat in anticipation of those needs, and he would try to keep member bank bor rowing at its current low level. For a free reserve guide, he would suggest approximately $400 million. As to the bill rate, while he would not want it to decline too much, he would not worry if it dropped another 4 to 6 basis points. In summary, Mr. Deming said, he was not advocating a policy of more ease. However, he would be inclined to place more emphasis on the side of reserves than on the side of the bill rate. He saw no parti cular reason to change the policy directive, and would be willing to argue that there was no need to change the word \"further,\" as used in the first sentence. In its present form the directive said just about what he was attempting to say with regard to monetary policy. He saw no reason to change the discount rate. Mr. Swan reported further economic gains in the Twelfth District, but at a very modest rate. Department store sales were well maintained in August and on into September. The unemployment rate in the Pacific Coast States (seasonally adjusted) declined from 5.9 per cent in July 10/2/62 -33 to 5.7 per cent in August. Employment increases although small in total were fairly general, with the largest occurring in construction. Some encouragement could be taken from the fact that in manufacturing there were gains in both durable and nondurable categories. The only major manufacturing industry showing no improvement from July to August was lumber and wood products. At weekly reporting banks total credit continued to rise during the first three weeks of September, with loan increases playing a rather significant part. Business loans increased and real estate loans continued to rise. One major branch banking system indicated recently that the increase in real estate loans, which it had been pushing for several months, had now gone about far enough to suit its purposes from the standpoint of portfolio balance. In August, there was a substantial increase in share accounts at savings and loan associations. Turning to policy, Mr. Swan indicated that he would favor moving cautiously toward a little greater ease. In a sense he felt that this had been done in the first two weeks of the past three-week period. The results were about in line with what he would have liked to see previously. The System would have to supply a substantial amount of reserves to meet seasonal developments in the immediate future, and it.should encourage a somewhat more than seasonal expansion in bank loans. Admittedly, it was not possible to solve everything 10/2/62 -34 through monetary policy, but in his opinion some operation on the margin was entirely justified. One of the reasons he had been advocating only a modest move toward greater ease was that while he had some question about the efficacy of still higher levels of short term rates he also recognized that a too sudden or too large decline in short-term rates might have adverse effects from the standpoint of foreign confidence in the dollar. However, since mid-July the bill rate had moved from a high of virtually 3 per cent to the present level of 2-3/4 per cent with, as far as he could see, no significant loss of confidence. He saw no reason at the moment for trying to move back up from the present level. In summary, Mr. Swan said, he would supply reserves fairly freely. He would think in terms of a free reserve figure somewhere around $450 million and a bill rate that would fluctuate around or slightly below 2-3/4 per cent. He would define his prescription as a modest move toward greater ease. After stating that he would not recommend a change in the dis count rate, Mr. Swan turned to the policy directive and said he had some sympathy with the point expressed by Mr. Robertson at the September 11 meeting. The present directive could well encompass the type of policy that he (Mr. Swan) had in mind. The main question seemed to center in one\\'s interpretation of the final phrase in the directive, which referred to maintaining a moderately firm tone in money markets. 10/2/62 -35- Mr. King withdrew from the meeting at this point to leave for an out-of-town engagement. Mr. Irons said that on the basis of figures for August and the first part of September activity in the Eleventh District seemed to continue without much change on a very high plateau. Most of the major indicators showed increases around 6 or 8 per cent from the year-ago range. He was not sure how the economy would come out of the present plateau. In the past it had never been known in advance just how the economy was going to move in such a situation. There was a tendency to keep looking for figures that might provide a clue; sometimes he thought it might be better to concentrate less on relatively small changes in figures. Attitudes in the District were good, according to Mr. Irons, with no pessimism evident among businessmen and bankers. He did not find any expectation of a great upsurge, but the majority sentiment looked for some further improvement during the remainder of this year. Department store sales were running 8 per cent above a year ago, with the recent movement just about seasonal, and there was no change in crude oil production. The allowables that had been in effect for some time were expected to continue, but the industry had effected economies and should show quite satisfactory profits at the end of theyyear. The industrial production index showed no change in the past month. Non agricultural employment was up, and unemployment was at the rate of 10/2/62 -36 4.7 per cent. Construction activity continued at a high level, although it dropped off seomwhat in the past month. On the whole this was going to be a good year for agriculture, with cash farm receipts probably 6 to 8 per cent above a year ago. Thus the pic ture in the Eleventh District was generally satisfactory. In his judgment, there was no indication at this time that the economy was inevitably recession bound. Mr. Irons said that he came out again in his thinking in favor of a continuation of current policy, with no change in the directive or discount rate. The Account Management should be given considerable leeway to operate according to the tone of the market, and he did not think the Committee should set up any figures as an absolute guide. However, if current policy were continued, including provision for a full and adequate supplying of reserves for seasonal purposes, he felt that this would probably result in free reserves somewhere around $400 million, give or take $50 million, Federal funds in the 2-3/4 - 3 per cent area, and a bill rate around 2.70 per cent. As to the bill rate, he would not put too much weight on any specific figure, but he would watch the situation continuously to avoid getting out of line with other factors and bringing about a situation that was not wanted. Perhaps a range from 2.65 to 2.75 per cent would be satisfactory. The Desk had a good impression in terms of tone and feel of the market, and could take steps to maintain the bill rate within an appropriate 10/2/62 -37 range. He would expect member bank borrowing to remain small, as it had been except for a day or two. The banks should not have to borrow for normal seasonal requirements in the weeks ahead. In conclusion, Mr. Irons said that to the extent possible, without aggravating other factors and without having to undertake substantial open market operations, he would consider it desirable to operate in the intermediate area of the market in order to relieve pressure on the short-term rate. He recognized that it might not be possible to do this in substantial amount or continuously. Mr. Ellis said that in New England the upward economic creep was continuing. In August, the industrial production index gained 1-1/2 points. Data for September were very slender, but they did reflect strong department store sales. Auto dealers reportedly were pleased with customer acceptance of the new models, and some reported a record backlog of orders. Mr. Ellis noted that the recent report of the Wharton School of Finance on investment funds had been blamed in some quarters for the recent weakness in the stock market. There was a measure of apprehension that the report would result in slower investment fund sales, and that some funds might become net sellers rather than buyers, with potential market impact. A check indicated that sales men had encountered some cusrteosmiesrta nce traceable to the impact of the report, and that sales were somewhat slower in September. 10/2/62 -38 However, the effects appeared to be minor and the funds apparently were continuing to grow. There seemed to be no real prospect of their shifting to the position of net sellers. First District banks apparently continued to experience a somewhat greater than seasonal loan demand. With demand deposits dropping a little more than seasonally in August and September, the average loan-deposit ratio reached a postwar peak in early September. Since then, there had been some recovery of deposits, thus lowering the ratio slightly. Mr. Ellis noted that the results of open market operations during the past three weeks had been within the area of expectations at the September 11 meeting. Except for one brief period, the Desk had avoided inadvertent tightness, which was in accord with the hope expressed generally by the Committee. The market appeared to have an understanding of the System\\'s willingness to supply reserves liberally as needed. Mr. Ellis went on to say that there continued to be need for concern about the international movement of funds. The position of the dollar might be explained verbally for a while, but the real impact was in the figures themselves. Therefore, he would like to see the System allow the international position of the dollar to be firm, and hold that firmness for a while, before probing to find the effects of a lower short-term rate. While it was necessary to have in mind 10/2/62 -39 internal problems, the domestic economy was still advancing. Until he saw a somewhat more serious economic prediction than was apparent in today\\'s staff presentation, he would regard any material change in policy as both unnecessary and undesirable. In these circumstances, and in view of the evidence of adequate liquidity and adequate avail ability of funds, he was led to suggest that there not be any basic changes in policy. For the forthcoming period, he would have in mind free reserves in the area of $400 million, a Federal funds rate within the pattern that had prevailed since last spring, and a short-term rate of around 2-3/4 per cent. He would continue to endeavor to avoid any inadvertent market tightness, and he would meet seasonal reserve needs freely, with a view to keeping member bank borrowing at a low level. As to the directive, Mr. Ellis said he was disturbed by the use of the word \"permitting\" in describing the Committee\\'s attitude toward expansion of bank credit and money, for he felt the word implied a grudging attitude that was not appropriate at this time. Without intending to suggest any change of a material nature in policy, he felt that the first paragraph of the directive could be improved by indicating that the Committee\\'s policy was to encourage the expansion of money and bank credit. He would not recommend any change in the discount rate at this time. 10/2/62 -40 Mr. Balderston commented that he had heard a great deal this morning with which he could agree. His own thinking brought him to about the same position that had been described by Mr. Ellis. The suggestion made by Mr. Hayes regarding the importance of fiscal policy was one with which he concurred. However, as he thought about that problem in relation to the determination of monetary policy, he kept reminding himself that although Federal spending in excess of receipts doubtless could be a potent stimulus if devoted to con structive purposes, such spending in this country was not always as constructive as it might be in terms of increasing the health of the economy and its competitive strength. Much of the Federal spending did not create permanent job opportunities, in fact tended to damage the profit expectations that would stimulate private invest ment and the creation of jobs. Mr. Balderston felt that the nature of the over-all problem had been described well by Mr. Shepardson. Existing excess capacity and unemployment could be traced to wage rates that had tended to keep many potential employees out of jobs and had resulted in prices that made it difficult, in some lines, to compete in world markets. The question was how to proceed from the present point. The progress in re-establishing a basic international balance was all too slow, and the figures presented this morning did not indicate that the problem would be solved quickly. During the time necessary to 10/2/62 -41 re-establish that basic balance, the willingness of foreign central banks to keep their reserves in dollars might diminish further. Consequently, he concluded that the Committee could not dismiss international considerations from its thinking and would not be able to dismiss them over the foreseeable future. While he would like to see some variation in interest rates to get away from the constant talk of pegging, the System should be alert continually to the impression being created in the eyes of foreign bankers, who were watching all the time to see whether the proper discipline and judgment were going to be exercised. Even though the situation now confronting the Federal Reserve was not of its own making and could not be corrected by monetary policy alone, nevertheless the central bank was looked upon by the world as reflecting the mood of the country in the area of monetary affairs. All of this suggested to him, Mr. Balderston said, that the System must continue to live with the problem of reconciling domestic and international goals. He saw no better pattern to follow than the one that the System had been following. Therefore, he came out at the point of favoring continuation of the status quo. Chairman Martin, after referring to the thoughtful tone of the discussion at the September meeting and at this meeting, went on to say that he had been planning to comment along somewhat the same lines as Mr. King. First, however, he wanted to make it clear that he did not 10/2/62 -42 profess to know the answers to the present problem. He did not have any firm conviction on a positive approach to its solution. Like Mr. King, he thought a stage had been reached where the old benchmarks and tests no longer applied. Mr. Bopp had stated effectively the case for easier money. If the old benchmarks and the old standards still applied, that would be the course to follow, but he (Chairman Martin) doubted whether they did. He was convinced that one could make just as good a case, in the present circumstances, that easier money would retard growth and development as that it would assist. The case could not be proven on either side, of course, but this was the real problem with which the System was dealing. The Chairman recalled having referred a number of times to the real estate situation. At present he had just come back from a personal study of apartment building in one area, and he was convinced that the picture would be better if funds were not so readily avail able; that the situation would be handled in a more satisfactory way, with satisfactory rentals, if it were not for the fact that builders could obtain all the credit they wanted at relatively low rates. Also, unless conditions changed in the economy, he thought it possible that the prime rate might be reduced. If that was in prospect, he would prefer to have market forces take the lead, just as he would on the up side, rather than to see the Federal Reserve in a forcing position. 10/2/62 -43 The Chairman said he came out with the view that when you are not clear what you should do--when there are two sides to the question--the maintenance of the status quo is usually the best course to follow. He felt that this would be the most appropriate policy for the Committee to follow at this time. In saying this, the Chairman continued, he wished to express his concurrence with those who had commented about a lack of comfort in the balance of payments problem. He had come away from the Fund and Bank meetings with a rather dim view of the situation. While he hoped that he was wrong, it would be foolish to ignore the possibility of a payments crisis at some point. The pace of activity throughout many parts of the world seemed to be slowing down at the same time, and he doubted whether the old stimulants were going to be brought to bear on a methodical basis, because nations would tend to reason primarily in their own interests. While he hoped he was wrong, there could be a critical period ahead. Admittedly, many storms had been foreseen that never developed, but he felt it was the part of wisdom to move cautiously. With regard to the points that had been made about fiscal policy, Chairman Martin recalled having remarked at the September meeting about the persistent tendency over a period of years to place on monetary policy too large a burden. Perhaps this would never change, but he felt it was the wrong approach. Should any crisis develop, he doubted whether monetary policy was going to be terribly effective. 10/2/62 -44 The Chairman repeated that he was not sure what should be done in this kind of a situation. Since we were not living in a laissez-faire economy, various efforts would be made. He hoped the tax reform that had been overdue for many years would be accomplished, and he thought it probably would. In broader terms, he noted that it is only when substantial difficulties are encountered that ways are found to meet them. In talking as he had, he might be taking too pessimistic a view. Nevertheless, he had felt that he should make these general observations, hoping at the same time that he was completely wrong in his judgment. So far as the System\\'s posture was concerned, Chairman Martin felt that it should supply all of the reserves that could be used constructively. In many areas of the economy, however, it was his judgment that additional reserves could hinder rather than help. Chairman Martin then said that while he thought the sugges tions made regarding the policy directive had merit, in his opinion it was possible to operate satisfactorily under the present direc tive. The use of the word \"permit\" had been debated before; perhaps a better word could have been chosen initially. However, he was not sure to what extent it was desirable to change words in the absence of a fundamental change in policy. It seemed to him questionable whether the directive could be much more than a skeleton outline within which the Account Manager had to work, knowing the shades of opinion around the table. 10/2/62 -45 Chairman Martin said it would be his inclination to poll the Committee on the basis of no change in the discount rate and no change in the policy directive, and see whether that carried. If it did, any dissents would, of course, be recorded. If it did not carry, the question of the wording of the policy directive could be opened up for further discussion. Question was raised whether this implied a continuation of current policy, and the Chairman replied in the affirmative. A poll was then taken on the basis indicated, and eight members of the Committee recorded themselves in the affirmative. Messrs. Mills and Mitchell dissented. In dissenting, Mr. Mitchell said that he did not object particularly to the language of the directive and that he would not favor a change in the discount rate. However, he felt that monetary policy should be easier. Mr. Mills said his reasoning was similar to that of Mr. Mitchell. He felt that a maintenance of the status quo was not appropriate to present conditions and that the Committee should move very gradually toward a somewhat greater degree of ease. He shared the Chairman\\'s concern about the longer run outlook and the possibility of a payments crisis. However, the stronger the American economy, the better this country would be able to stand any such crisis and assist its friends abroad. To that end, in his opinion, a policy that would be modestly more expansionary than the status quo should be adopted. 10/2/62 -46- The Chairman then inquired whether there were other comments, and Mr. Hayes said he would like to make it clear that in talking about fiscal policy in the course of his statement today, his comments were directed primarily toward tax reform. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to effect transactions for the System Open Market Account in accordance with the fol lowing current economic policy directive: It is the current policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to permit the supply of bank credit and money to increase further, but at the same time to avoid redundant bank reserves that would encourage capital outflows inter nationally. This policy takes into account, on the one hand, the gradualness of recent advance in economic activity and the availability of resources to permit further advance in activity. On the other hand, it gives recognition to the bank credit expansion over the past year and to the role of capital flows in the country\\'s adverse balance of payments. To implement this policy, operations for the System Open Market Account during the next three weeks shall be conducted with a view to providing moderate reserve ex pansion in the banking system and to fostering a moderately firm tone in money markets. Votes for this action: Messrs. Martin, Hayes, Balderston, Bryan, Deming, Ellis, Fulton, and Shepardson. Votes against this action: Messrs. Mills and Mitchell. Chairman Martin referred at this point to the announced intent of the Treasury to offer within the near future $250 million of long term bonds for competitive bidding by syndicates. He noted that Mr. Stone had referred to the forthcoming program and that Mr. Mills 10/2/62 -47 had alluded to the memorandum from Mr. Keir, which dealt with the degree of Federal Reserve support to the market that would seem appropriate during the period of the underwriting. Mr. Hayes said that he had read Mr. Keir\\'s memorandum with interest. If there was a point where he differed to any extent with the author, it might be in the suggestion--made or implied in the memorandum--that the Federal Reserve should make some statement to the market regarding its policy, and furthermore that the Federal Reserve should regard itself--within its own ranks--as having some commitment in this respect. Mr. Hayes felt that the System should avoid any real or implied commitment and should make no formal state ment to the market. He believed that the System should try to maintain an even keel during the period of the underwriting, just as it had always done in times of Treasury financing. There might be a slight difference, in view of the new technique being employed, from the standpoint of the length of the period when the even keel would be applicable; Mr. Keir\\'s definition of the applicable period seemed to him about right. In substance, however, he would hope the Federal Reserve might simply indicate to the market, if asked, that it would have every intention of trying to do what it had always done to main tain an even keel during periods of Treasury financing. He would try to avoid too specific a definition. The Government securities dealers 10/2/62 -48 were well aware of what had been done in the past, and they could interpret to the investment banking community approximately how the even keel had worked. Mr. Mills said he subscribed to what Mr. Hayes had just stated. He would be extremely cautious about saying anything. The market should look to the good faith of the System to give every reasonable encouragement to a Treasury financing, as it had done in the past. Mr. Mills expressed concern that if programs of this kind were conducted, and one of them did not go particularly well, the Federal Reserve would be importuned to offer strong support to the Government bond market and would run the risk of movig toward a peg. Chairman Martin commented that to him it made good sense that the System should not bind or commit itself in any way and that it should exercise caution. He subscribed completely to what Mr. Hayes had said. The Chairman then inquired whether there was any different view. Mr. Noyes noted that he had found the words \"even keel\" un satisfactory. He inquired whether, if any comment were made, the words might be excluded and the comment phrased in terms of avoiding any major change in policy during the period of the underwriting. He had observed that people frequently placed more meaning on the words \"even keel\" than was intended. 10/2/62 -49 Chairman Martin replied that, while he agreed, no doubt one of the first questions asked would be whether the System intented to maintain an \"even keel.\" Mr. Hayes observed that through long usage the words \"even keel\" did exist in the minds of many people in the market. If an effort was made to avoid their use completely, people in the market might feel that something had changed. Mr. Bopp suggested that the System could not even commit itself not to make any major change in policy. It could hardly make any com mitment except to act in a manner that would be regarded as rational in the prevailing circumstances. There being no further comments from members of the Committee, it was understood that the Committee agreed generally with the point of view expressed by Mr. Hayes in his initial statement on this subject. Messrs. Koch and Broida withdrew from the meeting at this point. There had been distributed to the Committee a report from the Special Manager of the System Open Market Account on foreign exchange market conditions and on Open Market Account and Treasury operations in foreign currencies for the period September 11 through September 26, 1962, together with a supplementary report covering the period September 27 through October 1, 1962. Copies of these reports have been placed in the files of the Committee. 10/2/62 -50 At the request of the Chairman, Mr. Coombs commented in sup plementation of the written reports with respect to foreign exchange market developments, the United States gold position, System foreign exchange operations, and Treasury operations that had been undertaken or were now in process. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the System Open Market Account transactions in foreign currencies during the period September 11 to October 1, 1962, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. With reference to prospective System operations, Mr. Coombs noted that under the $100 million swap facility with the Bank for International Settlements, entered into on July 16, 1962, there re mained outstanding $40 million under the System\\'s July 16 Swiss franc drawing along with $10 million under the August 7 drawing. (Of the $50 million July 16 drawing, $10 million had been repaid.) Mr. Coombs said he was hopeful that the System would be able to acquire additional Swiss franc balances during the coming weeks. However, it did not seem probable that the System would be able fully to reverse the outstanding drawings by the maturity date of the swap arrangement. The dollar had been strengthening against the Swiss franc, but not to a point where sizable purchases could be made. Accordingly, Mr. Coombs suggested that the Committee authorize a three-month renewal of the swap arrangement with the Bank for Inter national Settlements as well as the outstanding drawings. 10/2/62 -51 Without objection, the proposed three-month renewal of the swap arrange ment with the Bank for International Settlements, as well as the outstanding drawings thereunder, was authorized. Mr. Coombs also referred to the $100 million swap arrangement with the Swiss National Bank dated July 16, 1962, and to the outstand ing drawing of $50 million made on the same date, none of which had been repaid. The circumstances of this situation being the same as previously indicated with respect to the swap agreement with the Bank for International Settlements, Mr. Coombs suggested that the Committee authorize renewal for a three-month period of the swap arrangement with the Swiss National Bank as well as the outstanding drawing there under. Without objection, the proposed three month renewal of the swap arrangement with the Swiss National Bank, as well as the out standing drawing thereunder, was authorized. Mr. Coombs next reported discussion with the Governor of the Austrian National Bank concerning the continued flow of dollars into Austria, which had resulted in reducing to roughly 40 per cent the relationship of gold to dollar holdings of the Bank. Current arrange ments within Austria were understood to contemplate the maintenance of a 50 per cent ratio, and it would require gold purchases of roughly $80 million to restore that ratio. In these circumstances he had dis cussed with the Governor of the Austrian National Bank the possibility of a $50 million dollar-schilling swap arrangement in order to absorb 10/2/62 -52 an equivalent amount of surplus dollars on the books of the Austrian National Bank. If this were done, gold purchases between now and the end of this year might be limited to no more than $30 million. Further, upon maturity of the swap arrangement, the transfer of the remaining excess dollar holdings of $50 million into gold might be stretched out over the first quarter of next year. Mr. Coombs said he would be inclined not to seek renewal of such a swap arrangement at maturity. However, if the swap resulted in delaying the purchase of an equivalent amount of gold for a period of at least three months, he felt that it would be worth while. In the meantime there could conceivably be a reversal of the flow of funds, which would provide a means of liquidating the swap, but he felt that such a reversal was not in immediate prospect. In response to a question, Mr. Coombs cited economic recovery in Austria as the general basis for the inflow of funds. In particular, the tourist trade had picked up substantially. In discussion of the matter, Mr. Mitchell referred to the Guidelines for System Foreign Currency Operations, as adopted by the Open Market Committee on February 13, 1962, and commented to the effect that they appeared to contemplate operations to deal with short run reversible flows of funds. He did not understand that they 10/2/62 -53 contemplated operations that would interfere with fundamental adjust ments, which appeared to him to be involved in the Austrian situation.1/ In reply, Mr. Coombs noted that reduction of the U. S. gold stock was one of the elements in short-run psychology, which had a great deal to do with the position of the dollar in the exchange markets. Chairman Martin then commented that he would be inclined to regard the proposed Austrian transaction as an operation constituting an exception to the type of operations contemplated by the Committee\\'s Guidelines. The swap arrangement was proposed on a three-month basis, without renewal, and he saw merit in undertaking this effort for the purpose of spacing out prospective purchases of gold from the United States. In response to a further question, Mr. Coombs repeated he would not want to hold out to the Committee the hope of a reversal of the flow of funds into Austria such as to permit liquidation of the swap. This was possible, but he would not want to suggest to the Committee that it was a likely possibility. However, if the swap arrangement was executed, he hoped that the Austrians would stretch out their acquisi tions of gold until about the end of the first quarter of 1963. 1/ The Guidelines provide that System exchange transactions shall be mainly geared to pressures of payments flows so as to cushion or moderate disequilibrating movements of volatile funds and their destabilizing effects on U. S. and foreign official reserves and on exchange markets. 10/2/62 -54 In reply to another question, Mr. Coombs noted that the execution of the proposed swap agreement would constitute the giving of an exchange guarantee, not a gold guarantee. The swap agreement would provide a means of postponing the purchase of the equivalent amount of gold by giving the Austrian National Bank something that was not the same as gold, or a gold guarantee, but something that would relieve the pressure upon the Bank to purchase gold. Asked whether he foresaw the possibility of difficulty in purchasing Austrian schillings such as had been encountered in acquiring Netherlands guilders for the purpose of liquidating System drawings under the swap with the Netherlands Bank, Mr. Coombs pointed out that the Austrian schilling was now at its upper limit. At that level there was no problem, because the Austrians must sell schillings at the ceiling under their obligation to the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Hayes noted that it was necessary to have clearly in mind the difference between the U. S. Government\\'s negative attitude toward the giving of gold guarantees and its attitude toward exchange guarantees under swap transactions. Every swap that had been entered into had involved an exchange guarantee on both sides. After further reference had been made to the type of operations contemplated by the Committee\\'s Guidelines, Chairman Martin again stated that he would regard the Austrian proposal as an exception. In the 10/2/62 -55 circumstances, however, including the cooperative attitude on the part of the Austrian National Bank, he saw merit in making this exception. Question was raised whether similar situations might not arise in the case of other countries, and the Chairman replied that he thought this was possible. He suggested that the Committee had adopted the Guidelines with a view to possible changes after System foreign exchange operations had been conducted over an experimental period. Mr. Young indicated that the staff of the Committee would be glad to review the Guidelines from the standpoint of suggesting pos sible changes to the Committee. Mr. Hayes commented, in support of Chairman Martin\\'s earlier statement, that the Guidelines had never been intended to be permanent and rigid. At the outset the Committee had not been sure exactly how the foreign currency operations program would develop. It was a question of experimentation. Mr. Young noted that it would be planned, after the three month period of the Austrian swap arrangement, that the swap would remain outstanding on a standby basis, so this would be one more step in building up a network of such facilities. In reply to a question with regard to the advantages seen in an arrangement designed to stretch out over a period as long as six months a loss of gold that would otherwise be in immediate prospect, Mr. Coombs referred to the reaction of the European central banking 10/2/62 -56 community to a substantial loss of gold by the United States in any single week. If the United States had to lose gold, it would seem preferable to keep those losses orderly rather than to risk the pressures that might be felt by the respective central banks if it appeared from the gold figures that the line was being broken by unusual purchases of gold by any one central bank. Mr. Coombs said he could assure the Committee that the Treasury considered it desirable to do whatever was possible to stretch out gold losses and minimize substantial losses at any one particular time. Thereupon, further negotiations with the Austrian National Bank looking toward the execution of a $50 million schilling dollar three-month swap arrangement were authorized. Mr. Coombs reported recent discussions indicating that the Bank of Italy might like to be included in the network of Federal Reserve swap arrangements in the form of a $50 million dollar-lira facility. As he saw it, the major argument in favor of such a swap was the rounding out of a system of swap agreements with the major countries in anticipation of possible future needs rather than any present need. As long as the flow of funds into Italy remained basic, with no speculative overtones visible, he saw no purpose in drawing upon such a swap arrangement with the Bank of Italy. He rather expected that the Treasury would continue its present efforts to deal with the problem by various arrangements. Accordingly, he suggested 10/2/62 -57- that the Committee authorize negotiations with the Bank of Italy looking toward a $50 million dollar-lira swap facility on a standby basis. Without objection, negotiations look- ing toward the arrangement of such a swap facility were authorized. Mr. Coombs stated that during the recent Fund and Bank meetings a representative of the Bank of Japan had initiated discussions regard- ing the possibility of a dollar-yen swap arrangement. Mr. Coombs noted that the yen was not a fully convertible currency, but that Japanese officials hoped to be able to make considerable progress in that direction before too long. If this was done, he felt that it might be useful to enter into a swap arrangement with the Bank of Japan. The Japanese balance of payments had shown sizable swings over the past year or so; there was clearly a large element of reversible flows in the Japanese situation. There might also be certain advantages in a swap arrangement from the standpoint of providing an incentive for the Japanese to postpone purchases of gold; the Japanese gold-dollar ratio was only about 17 per cent. In these circumstances, he inquired whether the Committee would want to authorize negotiations looking toward a swap arrangement with the Bank of Japan as and when the Japanese yen moved to a point close enough to status of full con- vertibility to justify such an arrangement. 10/2/62 -58 Mr. Coombs added that he saw certain advantages in entering into standby swap arrangements with Austria, Italy, and Japan fairly soon and then letting it be generally understood that the Federal Reserve had more or less completed the network of such arrangements. The three countries he had mentioned, along with those with whom swap arrangements were currently outstanding, fell into the category of important industrial countries. There seemed a relatively clean line of demarcation between them and other countries of the world. Mr. Coombs pointed out that according to the Committee\\'s continuing authority directive on System foreign currency operations, the total of foreign currencies held at any one time was not to exceed $750 million. (This maximum figure had been fixed by the Committee at the meeting on July 10, 1962.) He suggested that the Committee might want to consider increasing the $750 million figure to at least $900 million. In this connection, Mr. Coombs said he was hopeful that the Bank of Canada might pay down its outstanding swap arrangement by some amount, since Canada was continuing to take in U. S. dollars at a heavy rate. On the other hand, during this particular season of the year the British might want to draw upon the outstanding sterling dollar standby swap facility and/or to enlarge that facility. In addition, there was the possibility that the Federal Reserve might want to acquire quantities of certain foreign currencies outright, including Netherlands guilders. 10/2/62 -59 Mr. Coombs likewise brought out that the authorization of the Open Market Committee to conduct negotiations looking toward a swap arrangement with the Austrian National Bank suggested the desirability of amending the Committee\\'s continuing authority directive on foreign currency operations at this time by adding the Austrian schilling to the list of currencies that the New York Reserve Bank was authorized and directed to purchase and sell. If the Committee wished to con sider the possibility of a swap facility with the Bank of Japan, it might also want to add the Japanese yen to the authorized list of currencies. In addition, consideration of swap arrangements with the Austrian National Bank or the Bank of Japan would suggest that the Board of Governors authorize the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to open and maintain accounts with such banks. In a discussion of the items referred to by Mr. Coombs, Mr. Mitchell expressed the view that it would be inadvisable for the Open Market Committee to consider the possibility of entering into a swap agreement with the Bank of Japan in the absence of more adequate background information. Going beyond this particular case, he suggested that in advance of discussion by the Committee of other swaps that might be proposed in the future, it would be desirable for the staff to supply written documentation to assist the Committee in forming a judgment. 10/2/62 -60 Mr. Young noted that there was a distinction between the Austrian and Japanese cases. The Austrians had met the conditions of convertibility of the International Monetary Fund, whereas the Japanese were only now going through that process. It might be some little time before the Japanese had met the convertibility conditions. Therefore, consideration of a possible swap arrangement with the Bank of Japan might well be deferred until the staff had provided the suggested documentation. After further discussion, during which Mr. Coombs expressed agreement with the comments made by Mr. Young in regard to the Japanese matter, Chairman Martin expressed the view that Mr. Mitchell had raised a valid point on the matter of procedure. In the future, it would seem desirable if the staff could furnish, in advance of Committee discussion, background documentation along the lines suggested. This had been done in several instances in the past when swap agreements were under consideration. With respect to the Committee\\'s Guidelines, Mr. Mills suggested that the impression may have been left from the discussion today that the Guidelines were not fixed. He expressed doubt as to whether that was the judgment of the Open Market Committee when the Guidelines were approved on February 13, 1962. It was in order to bring up the question of possible relaxation of the Guidelines, but as matters stood 10/2/62 -61 he felt that the Guidelines had been intended by the Committee as a stricture in the handling of foreign currency operations. Chairman Martin replied that this was why Mr. Mitchell had performed a service in pointing out that the Austrian swap was pro posed on a basis that would constitute an exception to the Guidelines. If changes were to be made in the Guidelines, however, he felt that the question should be considered fully by the Open Market Committee. Comments by other members of the Committee reflected an understanding that the Guidelines were not being changed at this time, that the proposed Austrian swap would be entered into on a basis that would constitute an exception to the Guidelines, and that further consideration might be given by the Committee at an appropriate time to whether the Guidelines should be formally amended. There was unanimous agreement that consideration of the pos sibility of entering into a swap agreement with the Bank of Japan, as and when the situation with respect to the Japanese yen admitted that possibility, would await the furnishing of appropriate background documentation to the Open Market Committee. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the con tinuing authority directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on System foreign currency operations was amended so as to authorize and direct the New York Reserve Bank, until otherwise directed by the Fed eral Open Market Committee, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following directive: 10/2/62 -62- The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is authorized and directed to purchase and sell through spot transactions any or all of the following currencies in accordance with the Guidelines on System Foreign Currency Operations issued by the Federal Open Market Committee on February 13, 1962: Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Netherlands guilders Swiss francs Belgian francs Canadian dollars Austrian schillings Total foreign currencies held at any one time shall not exceed $1 billion. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, October 23, 1962. The meeting then adjourned. Secretary. ',\n",
       " 'A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held in the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington on Tuesday, November 13, 1962, at 9:30 a.m. PRESENT: Mr. Martin, Chairman Mr. Hayes, Vice Chairman Mr. Balderston Mr. Bryan Mr. Deming Mr. Ellis Mr. Fulton Mr. King Mr. Mills Mr. Mitchell Mr. Robertson Messrs. Bopp, Scanlon, Clay, and Irons, Alternate Members of the Federal Open Market Committee Messrs.

Litterer and Lynn, Assistant Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapolis and San Francisco, respectively Mr. Eisenmenger, Acting Director of Research, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Mr. Cooper, Manager, Securities Department, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Com mittee held on October 23, 1962, were approved. Before this meeting there had been distributed to the members of the Committee a report on open market operations in United States Government securities covering the period October 23 through November 9, 1962. A copy of this report has been placed in the files of the Com mittee. At the request of the Chairman, Mr. Stone commented in supple mentation of the written report substantially as follows: The period since the last meeting has been highlighted by developments in Treasury financing. On October 25, two days after the last meeting, and in the midst of the period of maxi mum tension following the President\\'s speech on Cuba, the Treasury chose and announced the terms of its refunding operation. By the time the subscription books opened on October 29, tensions had eased perceptibly, bond prices had risen, and the rates that the Treasury had placed on its new issues, particularly the 3-1/2 per cent, 3-year note and the 4 per cent, 9-1/4 year bond, looked very attractive indeed to the market. The results of the refunding were highly successful from the point of view of debt extension, but perhaps too successful from the standpoint of the short-rate problem, for the public exchange into the 3-1/8 per cent certificate amounted only to a little over $1 billion. There has been some market comment that the Treasury might usefully reopen the issue for some of its remaining cash financing this year; and in this connection I should say that we plan to sell some of our holdings when opportunity arises, particularly in January. 11/13/62 Meanwhile, the bill rate had moved down to below 2.70 in the auction of October 29, and although it edged a basis point or two higher over the next two or three days, the rise was far short of offsetting a rise in British bill rates and a narrowing of the discount on forward sterling. In consequence, the covered spread between U.S. and U.K. bills widened to 5/8 to 3/4 of a percentage point, and money started to move toward London. This situation led the Treasury to offer a strip of $1 billion bills for auction on November 7, thus adding a third auction to the two already scheduled for last week. (The auction that would have been held yesterday was held last Friday because of the Monday holiday in a number of districts.) Bill rates moved sharply higher the day following the Treasury announcement, and many in the market regarded the three forthcoming auctions as a major burden which they viewed with a good deal of apprehension. On Monday, however, the higher rate levels that had emerged brought out a good deal of investor buying, and a consensus began to develop that the rise in rates had gone as far as it was going to go, and indeed might even have been overdone. In this atmosphere, the three auctions that had been viewed on Friday as major burdens were viewed on Monday as major opportunities to acquire bills while rates were high and prices low. In consequence, bidding was rather spirited in each of the three auctions, and the average issuing rate for three-month bills in the regular weekly auctions held on Monday and Friday were 2.84 per cent and 2.80 per cent, respectively, while the average rate in Wednesday\\'s auction of the bill strip was 2.87 per cent. It is interesting to note that the rate on the six-month bill has narrowed to only 4 or 5 basis points over the three-month issue, and indeed the one-year bill is only about 10 basis points above the three-month bill. These comparisons emphasize the point, which is worth repeating once more, that the demand for short-term secu rities, particularly by the corporate sector, continues strong. This strong demand presses on a supply of short-term securities that has been substantially reduced by the refunding. This funda mental fact was temporarily masked by the Treasury\\'s announcement of its bill strip, but it began to be reasserted very quickly last week and accounted in large measure for the ease with which the market handled those three auctions. I should say a word about the bond market. Prices of Treasury bonds moved higher nearly every day of the period just past, and by last week yields had nearly reached the 1962 low recorded last May. In the corporate market, yields have reached the May lows. We now have in syndicate a relatively small ($14 million) Aa-rated utility issue, which was reoffered at a yield of 4.22 per cent. Investors have shown resistance to this yield thus far, and it remains to be seen how the contest between them and the underwriters comes out. In the municipal sector, yields are at the lowest levels since 1958. New borrowing in that sector 11/13/62 -4 remains light, although a good volume of capital projects was author ized in the election and before too long we may begin to see some borrowing on the basis of those authorizations. Mr. Mills referred to transactions undertaken to acquire securities from foreign accounts since the October 23 meeting, and also to repurchase agreements entered into in that period. He judged that the acquisition of bills from foreign accounts was undertaken to keep those bills out of the market, but he inquired whether the transactions for the System Account might create a statistical illusion, at least when the report of reserves became available at the end of the week. In other words, the weekly report would indicate higher holdings of securities and injection of reserves into the market than actually had taken place, since there was no reason to believe that the proceeds of the bills purchased from foreign accounts necessarily would move immediately into reserves. Mr. Stone noted that if the securities that had been acquired by the System from foreign holders had instead been sold into the market, the initial effect would have been to withdraw reserves from the market. The Federal Reserve had purchased these bills because it needed to supply reserves to the market; the purchases from foreign account represented a means indirectly of supplying the needed reserves while at the same time minimizing the downward impact on the short-term rate that might other wise have occurred from System purchases in the market. As to repurchase agreements, the funds provided by this means were placed in the market until reserves became available from other sources. Moreover, while the 11/13/62 -5 dealers themselves were aware that these provided the market with only temporary funds, Mr. Stone felt sure that once the funds moved beyond the dealers into the market they were not identified beyond being available as reserves. Mr. Hayes stated that, with respect to the acquisition of bills from foreign accounts, such accounts do not normally keep a large cash working balance. Therefore, it seemed to him that the acquisition by the System of securities from those holders resulted in as permanent an addition of reserves to the market as would result from System purchases of securities from other holders. In response to questions from Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Stone stated that while time deposits of official foreign institutions had increased, none of the bill sales that the Desk had undertaken for foreign accounts had been for the purpose of raising funds to put into time deposits. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities during the period October 23 through November 9, 1962, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. There was distributed to the Committee a report from the Special Manager of the System Open Market Account on foreign exchange market con ditions and on Open Market Account and Treasury operations in foreign currencies for the period October 23 through November 7, 1962, together with a supplementary report for the period November 8 and 9, 1962. Copies of these reports have been placed in the files of the Committee. 11/13/62 -6- Chairman Martin turned to Mr. Coombs, who presented a review of foreign exchange market developments substantially as follows: The gold stock will probably remain unchanged this week for the second week in a row. We should be able to stave off further losses for several weeks to come and possibly through the yearend. We now have $50 million in the Stabilization Fund, with $40 mil- lion more available from the Swiss and possible sizeable receipts from the London gold pool. On the London gold market, the price has fallen off to roughly $35.09 as compared with a peak of $35.19-1/2 reached during the Cuban crisis. So far there has been no sign of private dishoarding in any volume, but an apparent shortage of foreign exchange is forcing the Russians to sell sizeable amounts of gold. Partly owing to such Russian sales, the October gold loss by the Pool was limited to no more than $35 million and since the beginning of November the Pool has actually taken in $50 mil- lion on balance. A Bank of England man who has recently visited Moscow reports that the Russians now seem to be persuaded that the Gold Pool is capable of holding the price and that they may continue to sell in some volume for another month or so. Most of the central bankers represented in the meeting of the Bank for International Settlements last weekend expressed considerable gratification over the way the Gold Pool has operated, more particularly in restraining the potentially dangerous pressures which developed during the Cuban crisis. As for exchanges, most of the European central banks also seemed to feel that coordinated operations by the central banks exerted a strongly stabilizing effect during the Cuban crisis. They expressed a great deal of worry, however, about reports that the U. S. balance of payments had deteriorated during the third quarter. As Mr. Furth will probably report, the deficit has in- creased to a truly alarming degree during October. As reflected in the exchange markets and central bank reserve positions, much of the outflow seems to have gone to France which continues to run a surplus in excess of $1 billion annually and, more partic- ularly, to Canada which has been pulling in very sizeable amounts of both short- and long-term funds. Sterling, which should have moved into a seasonal deficit during the autumn months, has also been firm while our hope that the Swiss franc would weaken, after the heavy speculative inflows of recent months, has been disappointed. The sensitivity of money flows to short-term rate differentials has been well illustrated during the past week or so by a flow of covered arbitrage funds from New York to London as the differential in favor of London increased to 3/4 of 1 per cent. As you know, the differential was quickly pulled down to almost 1/2 per cent 11/13/62 by the rise in our bill rate. Meanwhile, I telephoned Bank of England officials to suggest that the situation called for a three way squeezing out of the differential, involving not only a rise in our bill rate but also an increase in the forward premium on the dollar and possibly some decline in the British bill rate which had moved up during the Cuban crisis. Last Friday, the Bank of England brought about a decline in their bill rate from 3.78 to 3.72, but their efforts to increase the forward premium on the dollar have been frustrated by a concurrent outflow of forward arbitrage money from London to the Euro-dollar market. Ninety day rates on the Euro-dollar market have moved up strongly, partly because of the Cuban crisis and a repatriation of funds by German and Swiss banks. The main reason, however, seems to have been a revision of the Italian exchange regulations which has permitted the Italian banks to borrow Euro-dollars in heavy volume. Since November 1, such Italian borrowings of Euro-dollars have amounted to at least $140 million and in the process have been pulling funds out of London. I had numerous conversations on the telephone and again this past weekend in Basle with Italian officials who promised to do everything possible to restrain the pressures their commercial banks have been generating in the Euro-dollar market. As of the moment, the situation has moved into better balance with the Euro-dollar rate declining towards the end of last week, while the New York-London differential has also become reduced to about 1/2 per cent. In thinking about the possible future development of our exchange operations, I have been troubled by the problem of effectively converting our holdings of one foreign currency into another. Assuming that we wished to switch from marks into Swiss francs in order to absorb an excessive flow of dollars to Switzer land, there would, of course, be no technical obstacle to our converting marks into Swiss francs through the market or through direct transactions with the central banks involved. But the net result of switching, say, $25 million of marks into Swiss francs, either through the market or through direct central bank arrange ments, would simply be to place an additional 25 million dollars in the hands of the Swiss National Bank, thus frustrating the whole purpose of the operation. The most effective solution to this problem of switching from one European currency to another, of course, would be to negotiate with each of the countries concerned, arrangements whereby we might convert our foreign currency holdings into gold at their official parity, thus enabling us to use marks, for example, to buy gold which could in turn be used to buy Swiss francs without adding to the dollar holdings of the Swiss National Bank. As of the moment, however, we have been able to negotiate such gold purchase arrangements with only one country, namely, Switzerland, and this has not been particularly helpful in view of 11/13/62 the difficulties we have encountered in acquiring Swiss francs. And even if we should be able to acquire Swiss francs in consider able volume, our willingness to do so might be limited by the virtual nonexistence of investment facilities in Switzerland. Pending some effective solution to this basic problem, I have tried to find ways and means of temporarily switching from one currency to another in order to deal with temporary situations. As you know, during the Cuban crisis the Swiss National Bank took in $50 million and sug gested that we might mop up the entire amount by drawings upon our swaps with the Bank for International Settlements and the Swiss National Bank. In order to conserve our resources, I limited our drawing upon the BIS swap to no more than $20 million and dealt with the remaining $30 million by securing U. S. Treasury agreement to one month Swiss franc forward operations in an equivalent amount. These forward contracts will mature during December, when the Swiss banks will be engaging in the usual yearend window dressing and will probably be unwilling to roll over or extend such forward contracts. Against this background, I have negotiated a four-cornered deal involving the U. S. Treasury, the Bundesbank, the Bank for International Settlements and the Swiss National Bank, which will enable the U. S. Treasury to utilize $30 million of its mark holdings to acquire Swiss francs against a forward commit ment to repurchase marks with Swiss francs at the same rate. The net cost of this operation to the Treasury will amount to no more than the loss of interest on its holdings of German Treasury bills. This forward operation will be executed during December and mature in February, at which time the Swiss franc should be somewhat less strong than at present. As certain members of the Committee may know, the U. S. Treasury has been engaged in discussions with the Spanish Government during the past month or so with respect to finan cial assistance to that country. In view of those discussions, I think it would be useful to have research memoranda prepared evaluating the Spanish situation and the problems that might arise in connection with a possible swap arrangement. I referred earlier to the sizeable inflow of dollars into the Bank of Italy as a result of borrowing by Italian com mercial banks on the Euro-dollar market, and to the promises I had received from Italian officials that they would do everything possible to restrain such borrowing. Meanwhile, however, the Bank of Italy faces the problem of showing this sizeable increase, of at least $140 million, in its end of November statement. At Basle, Governor Carli suggested to me that the U. S. Treasury might wish to engage in further borrowing of lire, but I expressed some doubt, in view of the fact that the U. S. Treasury had only recently announced a 11/13/62 $150 million lire borrowing operation and a second opera tion following so quickly might well tend to stir up the exchange market. Since the Italian balance of payments has, for at least the time being, moved into more or less of an equilibrium position, I suggested that the influx of exchange resulting from Italian commercial bank borrowing on the Euro-dollar market might well be construed as a temporary affair which might suitably be dealt with by drawing upon a Federal Reserve or Treasury swap arrangement with the Bank of Italy. I noted, however, that the amount involved considerably exceeded our present Federal Reserve Bank of Italy standby swap facility of $50 million and that, accordingly, we might usefully consider the desirability of in creasing the Federal Reserve swap facility from $50 million to, say, $150 million. Governor Carli found no difficulty in such an enlargement of the swap facility but indicated that he would like to discuss with his associates back in Rome other possible alterna tives. At this present stage of my discussions with the Bank of Italy officials, therefore, I am not in a position to recommend Committee action to increase our lire standby swap facility to $150 million, but just wanted to bring the Committee up to date on negotiations so far. Finally, I should like to ask Committee approval of a renewal for another three months of our $50 million standby swap arrange ment with the Bank of England which matures on November 30. At the conclusion of Mr. Coombs\\' comments, there was a general discussion during which a number of questions arising out of his comments were reviewed. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the System open market operations in foreign currencies during the period October 23 through November 9, 1962, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. In response to a question from the Chairman, Mr. Coombs indicated that his only specific recommendation at this time was that the Committee authorize a three-month renewal of the $50 million standby swap arrangement, dated August 30, 1962, with the Bank of England. Without objection, renewal of the standby swap arrangement with the Bank of England, as recommended by Mr. Coombs, was authorized. 11/13/62 -10 The Chairman then referred to a memorandum from Mr. Sherman, distributed under date of November 8, 1962, which noted that at the meeting of the Committee on October 2, 1962, question was raised as to whether the Guidelines for System Foreign Currency Operations (approved on February 13 and reaffirmed on March 6, 1962) were formulated in a way to provide for a transaction such as the swap with the Austrian National Bank. A staff review of the Guidelines had indicated that the point was well taken. The review also indicated that the Guidelines did not provide for swap arrangements wholly or in part on a standby basis. Certain amendments to the Guidelines therefore were suggested, the pro posed changes being shown in the memorandum. In discussion, a change in the suggested amendment of Sec tion 2 of the Guidelines was agreed upon. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, Section 2 of the Guidelines was amended to read as follows (deletions shown by canceled type; additions by capital letters): 2. Exchange Transactions System exchange transactions shall [strikeout]bmaei nlgy[e/astriekdeo ut]o pressures of payments flows so as to cushion or moderate dis equilibrating movements of [strikeout]volaftiulne[d/st raiknedou t]t heir destabiliz ing effectS[stroink eUo.u St].e adn[d/ sftorriekiegonu to]f ficial reserves and on exchange markets. IN GENERAL, THESE TRANSACTIONS SHALL BE GEARED TO PRESSURES CONNECTED WITH MOVEMENTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE REVERSED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE; WHEN EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED BY THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET C0MMITTEE, THEY MAY ALSO BE GEARED ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS TO PRESSURES CONNECTED WITH OTHER MOVEMENTS. 11/13/62 -11- SUBJECT TO EXPRESS AUTHORIZATION OF THE COMMITTEE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK MAY ENTER INTO RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS ON EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS (\"SWAP\" ARRANGEMENTS), WHICH ARRANGEMENTS MAY BE WHOLLY OR IN PART ON A STANDBY BASIS. The New York Bank shall, as a usual practice, purchase and sell authorized currencies at prevailing market rates without trying to establish rates that appear to be out of line with underlying market forces. If market offers to sell or buy intensify as System hold ings increase or decline, this shall be regarded as a clear signal for a review of the System\\'s evaluation of international payments flows. This review might suggest a temporary change in System holdings of a particular convertible currency and possibly direct exchange transactions with the foreign central bank in volved to be able to accommodate a larger demand or supply. Starting operations at a time when the United States is not experiencing a net inflow of any eligible foreign currency may require that initial System holdings (apart from sums that might be acquired from the Stabilization Fund) be purchased directly from foreign central banks. It shall be the practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions in order that System transactions do not conflict with those being undertaken by foreign monetary authorities. The November 8 memorandum also suggested that, if the foregoing changes in the Guidelines were adopted, a minor change, as described, be made in paragraph (1) of Section III of the Authorization Regarding Open Market Transactions in Foreign Currencies, approved on February 13 and reaffirmed on March 6, 1962. Upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, Section III of the Authori zation was amended to read as follows (de letions shown by canceled type; additions by capital letters): 11/13/62 -12 III. Specific Aims of Operations Within the basic purposes set forth in Section II, the transactions shall be conducted with a view to the following specific aims: (1) To offset or compensate, when appropriate, the effects on U. S. gold reserves or dollar lia bilities of [strikeout]tDhIeSseE[Q/sUtrIiLkeIBouRt]A TING fluctuations in the international flow of payments to or from the United States, AND ESPECIALLY THOSE that are deemed to reflect temporary [strikeout]disequilibrating[/striektou] forces or transitional market unsettlement; (2) To temper and smooth out abrupt changes in spot exchange rates and moderate forward premiums and discounts judged to be disequilibrating; (3) To supplement international exchange arrangements such as those made through the International Monetary Fund; and (4) In the long run, to provide a means whereby re ciprocal holdings of foreign currencies may contribute to meeting needs for international liquidity as required in terms of an expanding world economy. At the Chairman\\'s suggestion, Mr. Young commented informally on his recent trip to Europe, reference being made particularly to a meeting of Working Party 3 of the Economy Policy Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and a meeting of the Economic Policy Committee that followed. Mr. Hayes commented briefly on a private meeting of central bank governors that he had attended recently while in Basle for a meeting of the Bank for International Settlements. The Committee then turned to a review of the economic and financial situation, and the Chairman called first upon Mr. Noyes, who presented the following statement on economic developments: 11/13/2 -13- Looking back over the last three weeks, it is hard not to allow one\\'s thoughts to be dominated by a sense of relief, and to regard the problems that remain as trivial compared to those that might so easily have been. This is all the more true because the information that has become available on the performance of the domestic economy has tended to be either favorable or less unfavorable than was widely anticipated. The very strong performance of auto sales in October--and especially in the last ten days of the month--has been so widely publicized that it needs no elaboration here. The relatively weak showing in other retail markets has received less attention, but it was associated in the trade press with unseasonable shopping weather. Aside from the surge of auto buying, which may have been completely unrelated, there was very little evidence of \"scare\" buying in the week following the Cuban crisis. The reaction in financial markets was also mixed and no clear trend attributable to the crisis developed. Stocks have generally moved higher, but this has been related by most observers to other factors than the crisis. Nor does the economy seem to have responded in any notable way to the results of the election. They are generally interpreted to have strengthened the President\\'s hand in Congress somewhat, but not enough to change substantially the pattern of legislative reaction to economic issues prevailing in the last session. Thus, two major developments--an international crisis of the gravest proportions and a national election--seem to have left the basic economic situation substantially unchanged. If there are plans for increases in defense expenditures beyond the levels contemplated prior to the Cuban crisis, we are unaware of them. So far as I have been able to ascertain, work is proceeding on the budget estimates for fiscal 1964 in a routine manner. The deficit for fiscal 1963 has not yet been officially re-estimated in the light of legislation actually enacted and economic develop ments since the budget message. There will, of course, be a deficit- and a sizeable one--but our preliminary calculations suggest that it will not be as big as some of the estimates that were made at the time a tax cut was under discussion in July. The seasonally adjusted cash expenditures and receipts moved from balance to a small deficit in the third quarter and will probably move a little further in the same direction in the current quarter. The shift in the budget on an income and product account basis is even smaller. In the interests of brevity, I shall pass over many develop ments of some importance which have been reported to you in the staff memorandum, but I think two surveys that became available 11/13/62 -14- to us at the end of last week deserve special mention. Both were in the fire just before the Cuban crisis and, of course, also before the election. The McGraw-Hill capital expenditure survey indicates that plans for such expenditures in 1963 exceed 1962 by around 3 per cent. If these plans are realized, it would mean about a continuation of the fourth quarter level of plant and equipment spending for next year as a whole. Consumer buying plans as reported by the Bureau of the Census show a somewhat more favorable picture--with intentions to buy new autos up sharply, some further recovery in interest in household durables, and house purchase plans down only slightly, perhaps no more than seasonally. Consumers were also a little more optimistic about their future income prospects than they had been in July. Taken together, recent developments seem to suggest that pro phecies of a significant downturn in the second half of this year were as premature as the forecasts of a $570 billion GNP for the year as a whole. It seems to me that it would be unrealistic not to assign some small role to monetary policy in this moderately favorable state of affairs. The fact that credit has continued to be readily available and liquidity has been ample has helped the economy maintain its modest forward momentum. A continuation and even some increase in this relative ease would undoubtedly contribute further to this end in the period ahead--and the favorable balance is certainly so delicate that it could easily be upset by restrictive action from any quarter. While the focus of my remarks has been, and will remain, on domestic economic conditions, I should add that I have noted with concern the apparent deterioration in the balance of payments situation in recent weeks. We can only hope that last week\\'s reversal in this trend portends some real improvement, for it is about as clear as anything can be in the uncertain business of economic analysis that monetary action drastic enough to have an appreciable short-run effect on capital outflows would have unfortunate consequences for the domestic economy. Mr. Holland presented the following statement on financial developments: The past few days have been eventful ones for the financial system, as Mr. Stone indicated earlier. Yet, rather paradoxically, some of these same movements have served also to bring somewhat longer run relationships into focus; this, together with the avail ability of more dependable figures now for the third quarter and for October, provides some improved perspective for decision making. 11/13/62 -15- Looking back, we can now see fairly clearly the pattern of moderately firmer money conditions that developed through June, July, and in some respects August, followed by a gradual suffusion of a more expansionary tone through much of the financial system that continued up until early November. This pattern is stamped upon the reserve situation, the interest rate structure, and the general market atmosphere although the precise timing of upturns and downturns in the different series inevitably varies. In retrospect, I think this change in reserve availability is best demonstrated by the course of total member bank borrowing from the Federal Reserve. Bank borrowing averaged $70 million in the first five months of the year, then climbed to an average $120 million between mid-June and mid-August, and thereafter has dropped back to the $70 million level characteristic of early 1962. These bare statistics describe a significant difference in bank experience: the lower figure is characteristic of a minimal level of borrowing, with a few banks meeting known seasonal or other needs and scattered others occasionally finding need for temporary assistance; the $120 million figure is high enough to involve a sizeable number of banks finding less reserves in the banking system than they expected, week after week, and being crowded into borrowing as reserve account ing periods draw to a close. In such contrasting circumstances, it would seem reasonable to expect that the resulting change in atmosphere would be disproportionate to the size of the borrowing figures involved, and that in fact appears to have been the case. Bank deposit expansion clearly slowed in the summer, then picked up in the fall, and by significantly more than seasonal dimensions. We have spoken at times in the past of the compli cations to interpretation created by changes in Government deposits and in time deposits. When the final figures are examined in broad perspective, however, it can be seen that whatever the week-to-week erraticisms contributed by Government and (to a lesser extent) time deposit changes, they do not alter the basic characterization of the summer as a period of slackened monetary growth and the fall as one of renewed expansion. Banks, in accomplishing this renewed deposit expansion, did not seem to meet much of an upswell of private loan demand. Most bank loan increases of more than seasonal dimensions seemed to concentrate in nonfinancial borrower categories for which banks were being more aggressive competitors with other lending insti tutions or with the capital markets. Beyond this, banks after July managed to add unevenly to their combined holdings of secu rities and financial loans, with sizeable fluctuations in holdings occurring around major financing dates. 11/13/62 -16- Capital market flotations, meanwhile, have not as yet shown much recovery after their summer fall-off from the high first-half volume. This is particularly true in the corporate market, albeit new issues may be held down by interim borrowing on favorable terms from banks, particularly by utilities. Statistics from other financial institutions give some indications of the increased effectiveness of bank competition, both for savings funds and for earning assets. On balance, however, consumers seem to be channeling a striking proportion of their savings into financial intermediaries of all types. Corporations, at the same time, are continuing to experience large cash inflows, and the statistics suggest a pause, if not a halt, in the long postwar down trend in corporate liquidity. These influences, along with fall uptrends in reserve availability and bank credit, have helped to create a gently stimulative atmosphere in most sections of the domestic financial structure. The events of the past few weeks, however, have drawn increased attention to developments in the international financial sphere. With interest rate incentives to international flows enhanced, several counteracting official actions were undertaken in domestic markets, at least partly in order to bring about a dampening of this incentive. The Treasury brought its strip of bills to market, and the resulting market reaction was reinforced by open market sales of bills from System Account. The Account was also able to meet a good portion of the reserve needs of succeeding days with open market purchases outside the bill area. Finally, the Board action cutting reserve requirements on time deposits--partic ularly the reduction at country banks--served to diffuse some reserves through the banking system without easing the central money market. The best single indication of the latter influence is the $160 million increase in excess reserves which developed this past week, while at the same time the Federal funds rate pushed up to the 3 per cent level in the central markets. This means the free reserve figure for this week had an upward bias, and the free reserve figures of the next few weeks will probably also be subject to this upward bias, although in decreasing dimension. At the moment, as Mr. Coombs indicated, this particular flurry of movement into foreign liquid assets appears to be subsiding somewhat. Any feeling of respite, however, needs to be conditioned by an awareness of market prospects regarding domestic interest rates. As Mr. Brill\\'s presentation to this Committee three weeks ago made clear, the current rates of individual and corporate financial saving relative to demands for funds bode further natural downward pressures upon domestic interest rates. In addition, before December is over we shall have entered the period of the year when seasonal downward rate pressures will be substantial, par- 11/13/62 -17- ticularly on the short rate. If, therefore, the circumstances that have made British and Canadian rates attractive relative to ours do not prove temporary, a more troublesome period for policy may be ahead. With such an eventuality possible, the domestic monetary and financial record of the last six months should be helpful. This record makes clearer than usual the benefits that a moderately stimulative monetary policy can bring, and also the consequences that can accompany even a moderately tighter policy, in something like the prevailing economic environment. This underlines the premium to be placed on maintaining tolerable international rate relationships in the months ahead, by means which will not restrict domestic credit availability unduly. Of various policy measures that could be impressed into service, one of proven effectiveness is concentration of Treasury financing in short-term issues, although this would be a substantial cost in terms of foregone opportunities to lengthen the debt and to tailor it more prudently. Other alter natives that could be considered include further reductions in bank reserve requirements, operations in forward exchange markets to increase the cost of covering money market investments abroad, increased concentration upon System purchases of securities other than bills, and even a raising of the interest rate ceiling applicable to 3-month time deposits, in order to allow banks to utilize this instrument to compete more directly for investible funds that might otherwise be bidding for 3-month bills. Each of these possible alternatives cited has its own drawbacks, and their probable effects on interest rate differentials vary. A careful comparison of the likely benefits and costs of each alternative action, however, might lead to a more efficiently integrated assault upon our domestic and international financial problems--an assault in which general monetary policy would need to play an important part, but in which it could be employed as something less than the ultimate weapon. Mr. Furth presented the following statement on the U. S. balance of payments and related matters: According to preliminary data, transfers to foreigners of gold, foreign currencies, and dollars amounted in October to a record sum of $900 million, more than twice the monthly average for the third quarter. The amount would be $75 million greater if it were not for a statistical adjustment by which, contrary to previous practice, certain newly issued government obligations that will not be redeemed within 12 months are no longer counted 11/13/62 -18- as liquid liabilities. While the data are fragmentary and ten tative, they probably give a reliable indication of the order of magnitude involved. The October transfers will bring the total for the first ten months of the year to $2-1/4 billion, according to the official computation. If both the statistical adjustments and the receipts from extraordinary debt prepayments are disregarded, the sum rises to $3-1/4 billion--as much as the deficit for the entire year 1961. But the increase in the October deficit over the average for the third quarter was probably due to non-recurrent factors. More than half of the deficit reflected transfers to Canada and included a few large capital transactions as well as considerable amounts of volatile funds, attracted by the unusually wide (un covered) interest-rate differential maintained by the Bank of Canada. Other extraordinary transactions were a large royalty payment to Venezuela and the final payment of the U. S. subscription to the Inter-American Development Bank. Some short-term money went to London in response to the re-emergence of a substantial covered differential in favor of British money-market paper. And I am convinced, although without statistical evidence, that the Cuban crisis led to flight movements of U. S. funds to countries regarded as safe havens. Finally, the threat of a longshoreman strike may have reduced the trade surplus for the month. Preliminary data for the first week of November show transfers from foreigners to U. S. residents, mainly on private account, of $150 million (excluding statistical adjustments). Last Friday, for the first time in months, there seems to have been a reflux of funds from Canada. Both developments support the view that the size of the October deficit was due to unusual circumstances. In continental Europe, there was less talk of an approaching end of the boom, and more talk of a need for restrictive rather than expansionary policies. For the U. S. payments balance, contractive monetary policies in Europe, especially if they involved a rise in interest rate levels, might be nearly as bad as an end of the boom. But Britain and Japan recently took some modest expansionary actions, Britain by reducing some taxes, and Japan by easing credit restrictions. Gold sales to foreigners since the beginning of October have been less than $100 million, a small sum considering the size of the October deficit and the impact of the Cuban crisis. But in contrast to the favorable short-run prospects reported by Mr. Coombs, we must expect larger sales in the long run. First, the Bank of Canada, which so far has not converted any of its dollar accretions into gold, will probably at the very least repurchase the $190 million of gold it sold to the U. S. Treasury last spring, as soon as it unwinds the remainder of the assistance it 11/13/62 -19- received in June from the United States, Britain, and the Inter national Monetary Fund; and it could do so any moment as it has by now gained more reserves than it lost during the first half of the year. Second, many European countries are likely to convert further dollar receipts into gold at a more rapid pace than hitherto. Until recently, some of these countries could use their dollar receipts for debt prepayments to the United States and repurchasing drawings from the Monetary Fund. But now, only Britain and France still owe large debts to the United States; and Monetary Fund holdings of dollars have nearly reached 75 per cent of the U. S. quota, the limit beyond which repurchases can no longer be made in dollars. Furthermore, the forward operations of the Treasury and, to a much smaller extent, the System swap arrangements have enabled some countries to convert straight dollar holdings into holdings protected by an exchange value guarantee. During the first nine months of this year, more than $600 million were thus converted by continental European countries. While the eight major continental European countries statistically increased their dollar holdings by $150 million, they actually reduced their uncovered holdings by $450 million. Only Austria, France, and Sweden accumulated any significant amounts of uncovered dollars; and Austria has meanwhile converted its entire accrual into gold or guaranteed dollars, while France continually converts dollars into gold and presumably intends to use the rest of its accruals for further debt prepayments. Only Sweden among all European countries apparently still adheres to the policy of keeping the bulk of its very modest reserves in straight dollars. The greater part of the decline in uncovered dollar holdings was on official account. Thus, the decline apparently was not so much the result of lessened willingness to hold straight dollars on the part of the public, but rather a reflection of the policies of the European monetary authorities. There are obvious limits to the volume of guarantees the Treasury and the System can give in order to prevent surplus countries from converting their dollars into gold. Unless these countries become more willing to accumulate uncovered dollars, we must therefore expect that the proportion of our deficit reflected in a decline in our gold stock will rise sharply, and with it the psychological impact of our deficit on the international standing of the dollar. Mr. Hayes presented the following statement of his views on the economic situation and monetary policy: 11/13/62 -20- The performance of the domestic economy appears to have been slightly better, on the basis of the data coming to light in the past three weeks. Particularly encouraging is the very strong behavior of auto sales in October, although this may reflect a bunching of sales as new models have become widely available. The prospects are for a good auto production level in November. The McGraw-Hill survey of business plans for plant and equipment spending in 1963 may be regarded as only mildly encouraging, after allowance is made for past inaccuracies in this forecast--but this evidence pointing to continued, though mild, advance finds some support in the NICB\\'s latest appropriation figures. Last month\\'s decline in unemployment would have had more significance if it had not been due primarily to a drop in the labor force. On balance, a relatively sluggish advance seems about the best to expect in the fourth quarter. I am somewhat reluctant to point with alarm at the increasingly discouraging balance of payments situation, as I realize that this can be regarded as \"playing an old record\". Yet I feel strongly that, as the central bankers of this country, we must give this factor very close continuing attention; and sometimes I have an uneasy feeling that this Committee is inclined either to overlook the seriousness of the risk of real loss of confidence in the dollar or to assume that other than monetary remedies for the balance of payments are so controlling that the Federal Reserve System can simply leave it to others to grapple with this danger while we keep our eyes focussed mainly on the domestic economy. This philosophy would seem to me quite unacceptable. Of course we must keep a close watch on the domestic economy--but at a time when most business indices are at historical highs, when the latest figures give little ground for expecting any imminent decline, and when the liquidity of the economy and the availability of credit remain ample, it would seem to me wholly logical to shift the weight of our emphasis a little towards international as against domestic factors. To back this view we need only look at the preliminary October data, which suggest for that month alone an over-all payments deficit of around $900 million, following the recently published official third quarter deficit of $2.9 billion (seasonally adjusted annual rate). Even after deduction of several non-recurring items the October figure is still about $700 million, the largest monthly deficit on record. Much of this reflects movements of capital into Canada, both short-term and long-term. Part represents Canadian bank window dressing; part the acquisition of Canadian time deposits by U. S. corporations taking advantage of high rates; part long term bond flotations in the U. S. In addition, the recent temporary widening of the covered spread between U. S. and U. K. short-term market rates has drawn funds to London in significant, though not very large, amounts, and this has included some transfers by 11/13/62 -21 American banks for their own accounts. Mr. Young\\'s comments on short-term rate expectations in Europe suggest that this type of problem is likely to be a persistently recurring one. Against this we can find satisfaction in the continued steady performance of the dollar in foreign exchange markets and the recent calm atmosphere in the London gold market. To a very considerable extent this probably reflects the increasingly close cooperation among leading central banks and recognition by financial markets of the strength of this cooperation. Yet we cannot afford to forget that the major cornerstone of this co operation is faith in the individual countries\\' ability and willingness to guide their own economic affairs in a way that will make for better international equilibrium. No member of this cooperative group is free to go its own way, concentrating on its domestic affairs and neglecting its international respon sibilities. We have seen many examples of other countries\\' willingness to take at times, strong measures for the sake of better international equilibrium that tended to be contrary to purely domestic considerations. Specifically, the large European holders of dollars have been led to believe that the U. S. is taking effective steps to eliminate its payments deficit within a reasonable period, and the September Bank-Fund meetings were marked by expressions of confidence on all sides that we were making steady progress towards this goal. In this atmosphere a sudden realization that we are not making progress, but are now retrogressing, could have very serious consequences, especially in the form of enlarged drafts on our gold stock. Now let us look for a moment at the current credit situation, which must necessarily provide the basic framework for our own operations. Bank credit apparently continued to grow at a strong pace in October. Investments of weekly reporting member banks in both governments and municipals were up sharply. Business loans were about in line with seasonal expectations, after the stronger showing of September and August--probably in part because of greater use of the market for new corporate bond issues. Banks have remained relatively liquid, the money supply rose enough in October to wipe out the net decline that had occurred since April, and the combined money supply-plus-time deposit increase was the largest for any month this year. Seasonally adjusted required reserves against private deposits have been close to or above the Board\\'s 3 per cent guideline since late October, and current projections suggest that they will continue to exceed the guide line through at least early December. As the Committee is well aware, an ample flow of savings and high corporate liquidity have been placing important down ward pressure on interest rates throughout the maturity range. Despite the temporary success of the Treasury and the Desk in 11/13/62 -22- reversing the downward trend of bill rates last week, the under lying forces seem to be asserting themselves again, and we shall have our hands full trying to maintain a firm rate structure, unless we face frankly the probability that a firm rate structure calls for a somewhat less easy monetary policy. With the inter national problem as pressing as it is, and with the Nation\\'s liquidity as ample as it is, I can see no excuse for pursuing a policy which is reflected in free reserves in a range only $100 million or so lower than the range we were aiming at at the bottom of the recession nearly two years ago. I believe we should make a moderate but definite move toward lesser ease, encouraging the 90-day bill rate to remain close to or even above 3 per cent. If free reserves in the neighborhood of $200 million should prove to be necessary to achieve this, I would have no objection to such a development. It might be argued that an immediate increase in the discount rate would provide a useful signal of our willingness and determination to use monetary policy to do our part in defending the dollar. At this point, however, I am not prepared to press this view and would be content to see a moderate tightening through open market operations as a first step. Obviously the closer we come to the time when a substantial tax reduction will become a reality, the less will be the risk that our own actions may have harmful effects on the domestic economy and the broader will be our scope for constructive monetary policy. If the Committee is willing to make a modest policy change of the kind I am advocating, I think the directive should be modified accordingly. In any case the reference to an imminent Treasury financing should be eliminated, together with the specific reference to a quarantine on armament imports into Cuba; and at the same time I believe we should place greater emphasis on international capital outflows and less on the desirability of encouraging further increases in bank credit and the money supply. The policy directive suggested by Mr. Hayes was as fol lows: In view of the margin of underutilized resources in the economy and the absence of inflationary pressures, it is the current policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to permit moderate further increase in bank credit and the money supply to the extent that this is compatible with the maintenance of money market conditions that are not likely to stimulate capital outflows from this country. This policy takes into account the difficult balance of payments situation and the important role of capital movements in the balance of payments. 11/13/62 -23 It is also the Committee\\'s policy to cushion such unsettlement in money markets as may stem from international political and military developments. To implement this policy, operations for the System Open Market Account during the next few weeks shall be conducted with a view to meeting seasonal needs for reserve expansion in the banking system while encouraging a somewhat firmer tone in money markets. Mr. Shuford, commenting on the Eighth District, noted that condi tions had changed little since May. The economy seemed to be on a plateau, with employment remaining near the level reached in May. With respect to unemployment, there had been a slight decline reflecting a decline in the labor force. The use of electric power was about the same as the May rate, and department store sales showed no significant change since spring. Bank loans rose little from September to October. Total deposits did con tinue to rise, as in the previous month, but the level of demand deposits remained essentially the same. The increase was almost entirely in the time deposit area. Mr. Shuford said that he appreciated Mr. Hayes\\' observations with respect to the international situation and that he recognized the problem. It was a matter not to lose sight of, and he was certain that the Com mittee would not. The domestic situation, however, was particularly dis turbing at this time in view of the relatively long, high-level plateau that had existed. Without losing sight of the international problem, it would be well, he thought, for the Committee to take advantage of any opportunity to stimulate production by monetary means. This would not call for any change in basic policy; he would think in terms of aiming at 11/13/62 -24 free reserves in the neighborhood of $400 million. Of course, the Com mittee did have the bill rate to consider, but he felt that the level of free reserves he had in mind was compatible with a bill rate in the neighborhood of 2-3/4 per cent. Mr. Bryan, reporting on economic conditions in the Sixth District, commented that some series were up and some were down. In general, the District series seemed to be following close to the national pattern. There had been some interest at the Reserve Bank in formulating plans to deal with problems that might have resulted from the Cuban situation; however, no appreciable effects of the crisis could be detected. There had been a run on canned water, and a run on automobiles in one area. However, the Bank could not detect any unusual currency demands other than in the Florida area, where for about two days during the crisis there was a greater than usual demand for large bills. There had also been some demand for currency from the armed forces in connection with the movement of troops, but that was all. Turning to the national economic picture, Mr. Bryan said he found it disappointing. One month was encouraging, the next was disappointing, and he found himself wishing the economy would make up its mind what it was going to do. The latest figures did offer a little encouragement, however. With respect to monetary policy, Mr. Bryan commented that he be lieved as little change as possible should be made. On the matter of the policy directive, Mr. Bryan said that he would recommend no change. As 11/13/62 -25 to Mr. Hayes\\' statement on the balance of payments, he agreed that this was a dangerous situation. However, the Committee must analyze the mechanics of influencing this situation through the use of monetary policy. He believed that if one analyzed that mechanism closely, it would come down to discouraging domestic economic expansion, and he had great doubt whether the Committee would want to take such a step. Mr. Bopp commented on developments in the Third District, noting that there was no evidence of buoyant activity. With respect to monetary policy, Mr. Bopp said that the last few weeks had been exceptionally difficult ones for him and others at the Reserve Bank. He found a great diversity and switching of individual views about current conditions and prospects--more so than ever before. At this time he would favor slightly greater ease, with emphasis on opera tions in the intermediate and longer term markets. With respect to the international situation, Mr. Bopp said it would seem to him that if the Committee felt it must adjust monetary policy to obtain substantial results, the Committee would have to tighten so significantly as to injure the domestic economy. Mr. Fulton reported that the Fourth District economy continued to move sideways, with no pronounced indication of either an upswing or downturn in the immediate future. After a poor showing in October, improved department store sales for the past two weeks had carried the index back to the high September average, and a record Christmas business was anticipated. Auto sales in major cities had advanced to new high ground, with a 11/13/62 -26 substantial number of undelivered orders on dealers\\' books. However, it was reported in some quarters that new orders had slackened, portending a possible cutback in production in late December. If sales were to decline, then a year-end inventory of 975,000 units would appear to be a reasonable estimate. Used car inventories were becoming heavy, with a softening in price. Construction contracts in the third quarter remained under the second quarter average despite the fact that heavy engineering contracts had been favorable, bolstered by public works expenditures. The increase in unemployment had been slightly more than expected on a seasonal basis. Those areas dependent on basic steel and heavy industry continued to have the highest totals. This was probably the result of the modernization of the mills and the increased use of labor-saving processes as well as the low operating ratio of the mills. The paper and container industry reported a good and increasing volume of output, but a highly competitive situation with soft prices. Large capital investments made over the past two years had increased capacity greatly, and the industry was waiting for orders to grow up to capacity and to increased prices and profits at that time. As to steel, Mr. Fulton said there was some indication that the automobile companies were beginning to reach the bottom of their inventory stockpile and were ordering increased tonnages to maintain current high production. However, other users of steel had not increased takings; in fact, some mills reported a reduction of orders, There was no indica tion of inventory building. Orders were on a hand-to-mouth basis, with 11/13/62 -27 the mills still carrying inventories for immediate delivery. The estimate of production for 1962 was 97.5 to 98 million tons; for 1963, about the same. The steel companies were more and more concerned about the import of foreign steel at prices under those obtained abroad. A recent meeting of industrial economists indicated that new orders of many firms were below current sales, with a consequent decline in backlogs. Others stated that new orders had not increased as expected seasonally. Some of these economists felt that the economy had already peaked out; others felt that a softening would occur after the turn of the year. Mr. Fulton said he was inclined to the premise that the stability in the indexes was only a pause and that the economy might break out on the up side rather than into a recession. If a downturn occurred, he believed it would be minor and short-lived. He would like to see fewer reserves supplied to the banking system and a firmer tone in the short term market, with no further decline in the long end. The large increase in time money posed a threat to future stability. Until the strip of bills was sold last week, short-term rates had declined progressively, as had long-term Governments, municipals, and corporates. These movements had encouraged the outflow of funds on a covered basis. Mr. Fulton felt that monetary policy had all but surfeited the economy with reserves and that the time had arrived to slow the injection of funds. He would sug gest maximum free reserves of $300 million. 11/13/62 -28- Mr. Mitchell presented the following statement: Formulating policy in the current economic atmosphere is exceptionally difficult. Fears of another postwar-type re cession seem less pervasive than earlier, but hopes for a sustainable significant upthrust also seem to be rapidly fading into the oblivion of \"no change.\" The economy continues to absorb jolts--both economic and political, internal and inter national--but it does it at per capita zero, i. e., with deflated GNP per capita showing no significant change, as it did between the second and third quarters and probably will between the third and fourth. An economy in which GNP is not rising faster than the growth in population is not the image we have of ourselves nor one that we want others to have of us. It conforms neither to our needs nor our aspirations and it is not an equilibrium situation for long. Something will happen which will stir the economy from per capita zero. It may roll off the roof with everyone, including the foreigners, watching helplessly. It may get up and go, following a substantial reduction in taxes or a substantial increase in defense spending. It would more surely be in a go position if monetary policy gave the increasingly serious domestic needs a higher priority than it gives the intractable problem of trying to maintain an artificial rate structure for balance of payments purposes. The problem is approaching a crisis stage because the sort of economy we have is generating a large and increasing amount of savings, which in the free play of markets would be put to work by depressing the interest rate structure. In the corporate area, a high level of profits and a growing volume of depreciation charges is being maintained while inventory spend ing is reduced and capital spending is leveling off. The result points toward a glut of business funds available for investment and a decline in capital financing needs. In the consumer area, flows of savings continue to grow, at least those that can be categorized as \"nondiscretionary.\" Debt repayments are beginning to catch up with new debt extensions, and the volume of savings flowing to pension funds and insurance companies grows with regularity. At the same time, we seem to be getting a shift in the structure of consumer saving, with the decline in the stock market and the diminished availability of corporate and municipal flotations forcing a diversion of savings into thrift institu tions. Against this background of rising private savings and de clining private credit needs, the Federal Government doesn\\'t appear to be much of a contracyclical force, at least through fiscal action. The cash budget was in balance in the second 11/13/62 -29- quarter, on a seasonally adjusted basis, and in only very small deficit in the third quarter. For the calendar year as a whole, the cash deficit is likely to be only $5 to $5-1/2 billion, down from close to $7 billion last year. (Even on the national income and product basis, the deficit would be rather small, perhaps on the order of $2 billion compared with almost $4 billion last year and over $9 billion in 1958.) Neither can we regard debt management as having been contracyclical since (a) the Treasury has borrowed more than it needed in terms of expenditures and receipts, and locked up the excess in its cash balance,1/ (b) has--at least in recent months--been reducing the supply of short-term liquidity instruments through extensive refunding actions. How long can the rate structure withstand such Federal fiscal and debt management policy, growing private liquidity, and a re serve policy which keeps free reserves in at least the $300-$400 million range? This is not a tenable combination of policies and facts, and we ought to recognize it. I urge that we practice what we preach about free markets, and let the rate structure obey the laws of savings supply and investment demand. But if the Committee remains persuaded that the foreign situation should continue to dominate its posture, it makes a difference as to how that objective is realized. We could, of course, try to maintain the desired short-rate level by snugging up on reserves. This might have some expectational effect for a while, but I doubt whether, once it started, we could maintain this effect without successive reductions in reserve availability. How far it would have to go I don\\'t know, but in a sluggish economy generating so much liquidity I suspect it would ultimately have to go far. I would venture that there are few at this table who would be willing to live with net borrowed reserves while unemployment remained close to 6 per cent. Can we start on a course in this direction without being prepared for such a consequence? I doubt it. There is another possible line of action, one we haven\\'t explored to the fullest. This would be providing a reserve climate favorable to renewed domestic expansion by injecting re serves primarily outside the short end of the investment spectrum. Despite all the talk about having freed ourselves from the bills-only restriction, we still behave as though this were still the prevailing rule. I know that some will argue that 1/ Which need not be deflationary so long as monetary action permits bank reserve expansion to continue over and above reserves needed to support Treasury balances. 11/13/62 -30- it can\\'t be done in the magnitude needed for reserve operations, and that some will argue that we will wind up dominating and distorting the rate structure. I think the burden is on them to prove that it can\\'t be done, especially since this would be a move in the same direction that market forces are now working. As for compromising our allegiance to free market forces, it seems ridiculous to talk about maintaining a \"free\" long-term market so long as we are putting a floor under the whole rate structure by pegging the short rate. I, too, would be in favor of letting the markets run free, but if we won\\'t, we may be able to do an effective job of controlling both level and structure. Finally, I recognize that this policy runs the risk of accelerating long-term capital outflows, perhaps in sub stantial magnitude. Here again, the burden must rest on those who advance this argument, and I would welcome any evidence that would enable us to quantify the risk. We have about run out of devices to bolster the rate structure in its present form while facing the increasing need, both for domestic and international reasons, to stimulate in vestment demand. Unless the System is willing to utilize its last arrow--pushing reserves out through aggressive intermediate and long-term purchases--we may well have to face a slippage in rates along the line or a tightening of credit availability in the face of a host of domestic economic indicators calling for a contrary policy. Timing is important if this operation is to be used. The flow of funds seeking investment has put rates in capital and mortgage markets under considerable pressure. More pressure will be supplied by seasonal factors at year end. If we act overtly and aggressively now, for a few months we will have market trends and seasonal forces with us; we might also have the bene fit of some expectational influence. On the short side, the bill rate could be held up a while longer. There is every reason to believe that this policy would be significantly stimulative; it moves in the same direction as market forces. It should fore stall a decline in over-all business activity and thus avert the damaging effect of that development on business psychology. Properly executed, it could get the economy moving ahead again. When that goal has been achieved, the dilemma of policy we face will have been dissolved. Mr. King said that he was slightly encouraged about the domestic economy. While he did not foresee any strong breakthrough at this time, he did not believe the economy was quite so sluggish. He did not base 11/13/62 -31 this judgment of the situation on economic reports and statistics, but on his own \"straws in the wind.\" With respect to the balance of payments, Mr. King commented that there was nothing in the record at present about which to be encouraged. Looking back at the domestic economy, he felt the Committee\\'s contribution had been large and real. He was reassured to a large extent by the forma tion of time and savings deposits. He did not believe it would be wise to predicate any change in policy on a tax cut. While some might be hopeful with respect to a tax cut, he was less hopeful; the possibility of achieving it was far from clear. Mr. King noted that his attitude regarding the balance of payments had followed a course varying from slightly more concern to slightly less concern. In the past year or so he had attached a little less significance to it because of doubtful forces in the domestic economy. However, as he had said, he was presently somewhat encouraged, particularly because of the economy\\'s demonstrated ability to absorb the shocks it had absorbed, while his concern about the international situation was slightly greater than it had been. Nevertheless, despite his view that the international situation warranted concern, he would not favor a change in System policy at this time. Mr. King believed that System policy had been constructive. He also believed that the Committee\\'s responsibility required it to stay on line. Mr. Robertson presented the following statement: I returned to the deliberations around this table, after missing two consecutive meetings, to find the general business situation still disappointing. Auto sales have been spectacular 11/13/62 -32- for a few weeks, after the new model introductions, but this is not yet a reliable basis on which to judge prospects for the full model year, and moreover the auto industry is not likely to be able, by itself, to reinvigorate a slack economy. I would judge, from what I have heard this morning, that the most favor able general statement that can be made about the economy is that at least the recession that had been forecast by some gloomy prophets has failed to materialize. The harsh fact remains that we still face an economy with a substantial amount of un utilized resources and with a current rate of growth so slow that, unless it is stimulated, it offers no hope for putting these re sources back to work. On the other hand, I am heartened by what monetary policy appears to have accomplished this fall. I note that the slightly easier bank reserve position has been accompanied by a general downward drift of interest rates and a fairly substantial pace of monetary expansion. This seems to me the kind of stimulative credit atmosphere which I hoped for when I voiced my views at the late September meeting of the Committee. I regard this as an attribute of policy with longer-range significance, and a policy appropriate, indeed essential, for the alleviation of our longer-range problem of economic growth. With respect to our coordinate problem of achieving a viable international balance of payments position, I judge that our sit uation has become neither much better nor much worse, taking the year as a whole. In terms of the sales of goods and services across international boundaries, perhaps the most that can be said is that we have experienced not quite as much worsening of trade surplus as would be expected cyclically. The fundamental fact in this area, however, continues to be that our trends of prices and costs are less inflationary than for our leading industrial com petitors, and hence our basic competitive position is improved. Even \"Cuba\" has not seemed to disturb that relationship. This I regard as the most fundamental fact about our international situation, and its long-run implications are favorable. We have been beset in recent days with an upsurge of news suggesting actual and potential net capital flows from this country to other major nations, chiefly Canada. Comments make it clear that these flows have occurred for a variety of reasons, most of which do not seem to be associated with interest rate differentials on money market assets. So far as I know, those few flows that might be moving into foreign money market assets for purely interest rate reasons are themselves responding to rate differentials which have no certainty of persisting. Certainly the policies of Canada are not rooted in circumstances which should compel a long continuing maintenance of their short term interest rates at levels so far above our own. 11/13/62 -33 More basically, however, I think we should be careful not to place too much\\'w eight in our policy formulations upon these short term capital flows which may exist for transitory reasons. One need only take a look at the international financial problems of the United States, and other major industrialized countries, through the eyes of the less developed countries -- as I have been privileged to do recently -- to realize the overwhelming strength of our position and the unnecessary anguish involved in overemphasiz ing disturbances such as we have been witnessing these past few weeks. The industrial nations of the free world do not experience precisely the same pattern of economic developments, and they cannot always be expected to follow policies which mesh neatly the financial conditions in their money, credit, and capital markets. When changed economic circumstances are developing and new policies need to be evolved to deal with them, some less than perfect interest rate relationships must be expected internation ally, with corresponding flows of capital developing. Indeed, in a dynamic world, in which change is continual, pressures of unexpectedly large capital flows,\\' first in one direction and then in another, ought to be expected to occur. It is important for us to remember that, for all our gold losses of recent years, we are still probably in a better position to withstand the pressures of capital flows during periods of economic transition than is any other country. It behooves us to handle our domestic economic policies accordingly. To be specific, I think this means we should not alter monetary policy with every shift in the breeze of inter national capital flows, but aim our policy in so far as we can to press in the direction of our longer-range objectives. It seems to be clear, as I have indicated earlier, that our fundamental position domestically, with substantial underutiliza tion of resources, is unfavorable; while our fundamental position internationally, with our improving competitive cost-price re lationships, is favorable. As a result, it seems to me the policy prescription is obvious: continue to promote a monetary environment with ample availability of bank credit and liquidity in order to assist in stimulating higher rates of employment and economic growth. This, to me, is putting first things first. I would ex pect such an objective to be served by a free reserve level ranging at least around $450 million, with stable to buoyant conditions prevailing throughout the credit and capital markets. Mr. Mills said the statement he would make was not intended to minimize the seriousness of the balance of payments situation, but tied into his previously expressed belief that a strong United States economy was the best guarantee to long-run worldwide economic growth and foreign exchange stability. 11/13/62 -34- Therefore, he believed that domestic considerations must take precedence over international balance of payments considerations. If, however, the balance of payments situation worsened critically, stern and strong measures should be taken and temporizing experiments abandoned. By strong measures, he referred to such as those the United Kingdom and Canada had effectively taken during the last year and which contained confidence restorative qualities. Mr. Mills then presented the following statement: As the year 1962 comes toward its close, a backward rather than a forward look offers the best vantage point from which to develop an appropriate Federal Reserve System monetary and credit policy reaching into the year 1963. A portentous appraisal of past economic events must include the years of 1961 and 1962 and leads to the conclusion that throughout both years the national economy held its own, but little more. Coincidentally, the leveling-out in the money supply that has occurred in 1962 was accompanied by a flattening-out in general economic activity. Furthermore, over this period obsolescence has run down excess plant capacity at the same time that a rapid growth in population has increased human wants and needs--all of which, in line with some slight seasonal strength, indicates that the economy may now be poised for a new upsurge in growth entailing a vigorous revival of enlarged capital investment programs, in the process of which new industries and their outlets for capital expenditure may be uncovered. A Federal Reserve System monetary and credit policy less re straining and more expansionist than that now in evidence can be an important influence for stimulating economic activity and, in par ticular, for encouraging the expansion of commercial bank credit with consequent support to growth in the money supply, which latter is an essential ingredient for any advance into new ground. However, it will be necessary for Federal Reserve System policy to revert to the kind of free market principles that are largely identified with a \"bills only policy\" if the objectives sought after are to be realized. A flexible monetary and credit policy freed from the pegging re straints by which it is now handicapped would also be consistent with a monetary attack on the nation\\'s balance of payments problems, be cause dealers in U. S. Government securities would be constrained to reduce their positions and in adding to the market supply of securities in this manner, an upward pressure would be exerted on interest rates 11/13/62 -35 that could be backed up through open market policy actions--and all within the context of providing adequate credit availability and an incentive for credit expansion. In other words, a firm interest rate structure as a balance of payments defense, and opportunities for credit expansion, can be made to be consistent with a flexible monetary and credit policy. I see no need for an increase in the discount rate at this moment, nor a change in the directive whose framework carries ample authority for conducting the kind of monetary and credit policy proposed--but which authority has not been used to my satisfaction in the interval since the Open Market Committee\\'s last meeting. Mr. Wayne reported that Fifth District business conditions had ap parently remained quite stable during the past few weeks. According to the Reserve Bank\\'s latest survey, the downtrend in textiles had moderated significantly, with orders and shipments steady but employment and hours still tending to decline. In other manufacturing industries, shipments had reportedly continued to rise, but new orders, employment and hours had remained about the same. Construction activity continued at a high level even though contract awards had been declining. Retail trade appeared to be exhibiting normal seasonal strength at near-record levels, and the demand for coal was somewhat stronger again. Two aspects of the national economy seemed to him particularly worthy of attention; Mr. Wayne said. The first was that in the nation, as in the Fifth District, business activity had remained quite stable at a high level, gaining considerable support from record automobile production and sales. The second was the economy\\'s remarkable stability in the face of the Cuban crisis. This, on top of the steel difficulties, the stock market decline, and the Canadian monetary crisis, suggested that the economy was in a stable equilibrium not likely to be upset by anything short of a major 11/13/62 -36 disturbance. Increased military activities would certainly raise defense spending and the budgetary deficit to some degree, but unless there was a further acceleration of the military buildup, it was not likely to cause any strong upsurge in business. It seemed more probable that the increased spending would simply be an additional force tending to sustain activity at about its present high level. In the policy field, Mr. Wayne said he did not see any valid argu ments for more ease. He would recommend that the Committee aim at a level of free reserves of $400 million or less, and that special attention be given to keeping the three-month bill rate above 2.75 per cent and preferably above 2.80 per cent. He believed the Committee should make it clear--by actions not words--that it had not changed policy in either direction. The reference to Treasury financing should be eliminated from the directive. Mr. Clay noted that recent events had underscored the dilemma of monetary policy with which the Federal Open Market Committee had been wrestling for more than two years. This dilemma had resulted from unfavor able developments in the international balance of payments at the same time that the domestic economy was showing little basis for encouragement. It was apparent that the month of October brought little change in the level of seasonally adjusted activity in the national economy. While new auto mobile sales were outstanding, the aggregate performance of the economy in terms of production, employment, and sales added up to little more than seasonal increases. The full meaning of the very favorable beginning of the new automobile sales year was not yet apparent; it would be necessary to await further sales developments in order to be able to gauge the basic 11/13/62 -37 strength of that market and its impact on the economy. Looking ahead, the McGraw-Hill survey of business capital spending plans for 1963 did not foreshadow an expansionary impact from that important sector of the economy. Rather, the report projected a pace of activity that at best was sluggish. All in all, except for the spurt in automobile sales, economic indicators at the moment produced little evidence of ex pansionary forces in the private sectors of the economy leading to sig nificant strides toward fuller employment of manpower and other resources. Under the circumstances, Mr. Clay said, the goal of public policy for domestic purposes should be one ,of endeavoring to stimulate economic activity. For monetary policy, that meant to him a program of monetary ease leading to the provision of member bank reserves and the expansion of bank credit in excess of seasonal proportions and to a further downward movement in the level of interest rates. Recent evidence of declining rates and improving credit availability in the residential mortgage market were one aspect of the response to these policies over past months. Mr. Clay noted that recent developments in the international flow of funds had led to Treasury financing and Committee open market operations fostering higher Treasury bill yields. He felt that this deterrent to down ward movement in short-term rates should not be permitted to inhibit the provision of member bank reserves in excess of seasonal proportions and a further easing of longer term yields. The Committee should seek the attain ment of these objectives by purchasing longer term securities and by con ducting offsetting purchases and sales so far as necessary to attain its goals. 11/13/62 -38 In Mr. Clay\\'s opinion, the Reserve Bank discount rate should be left unchanged. As to the directive, in the present directive\\'s reference to the recent Treasury financing operation and the emergency aspects of the Cuban crisis, it apparently would have to be rewritten. Mr. Scanlon reported that in the Seventh District concern about the business outlook appeared to have taken a favorable turn in recent weeks. The views expressed by the Reserve Bank\\'s directors at their meeting last Thursday tended to reinforce this view. One important factor had been the extremely high level of auto sales. Also, manufacturers of some other con sumer durables had reported a strong rise in sales to dealers. Another factor was the expectation that military spending would be increased more than was planned earlier and that the kinds of items produced in Midwest plants would share in the spending rise. While the impact of these developments could be of short duration, they had tended, in the meantime, to bolster waning busi ness confidence to some extent. As Mr. Noyes had indicated, developments in the auto industry hardly required comment, Sales in October were phenomenal--well above expectations- and orders for future delivery were said to be large in comparison to the experience of recent years. Sales of domestically produced cars in October were the highest for any month in history and were exceeded only by May 1955 on a daily rate basis. Instead of increasing as expected, dealer inventories declined during October. Production schedules had been increased, and called for more than 2 million assemblies in the fourth quarter. If realized, this would exceed the record for the period, established in 1955. 11/13/62 -39 As to policy, while the balance of international payments data clearly indicated that no solution to problems in that area was imminent, Mr. Scanlon suggested that the combination of domestic and international con ditions appeared to call for continuation of the policy objectives stated in the current directive. The directive should be changed to remove the ref erence to imminent Treasury financing and eliminate specific reference to the potential financial effects of the quarantine on military imports to Cuba. He would not change the discount rate at this time. Mr. Deming said the latest available evidence continued to indicate that the Ninth District economy was pushing ahead at a moderate pace, sparked by the excellent farm situation. September personal income was up from August and was 8-1/2 per cent ahead of a year earlier. October bank debits were 8 per cent larger than in October 1961. Nonagricultural employment in Minnesota in October, after seasonal adjustment, rose slightly from the September level. Insured unemployment was well (40 per cent) below year-ago totals in both September and October. In a survey of business opinion taken early in November, two-thirds of the respondents reported retail sales up and auto sales up considerably. The bulk of the respondents reported man ufacturing and nonmanufacturing employment holding even to up slightly and unemployment even to down slightly. For the weeks ahead, two-thirds saw improvement in business as probable or certain, and most of the remainder saw business continuing stable, about the same pattern as had held since early July. 11/13/62 -40 The District banking picture remained about the same, with deposits growing and loan demand fairly strong. In October city bank loans behaved about in normal fashion, but this followed a very strong September expansion. Country bank loans grew at a record level in October, and they also were strong in September. Both types of banks remained in a fairly liquid position. Borrowings from the Reserve Bank were nominal, and those banks in the Federal funds market had been mainly on the selling side. With respect to monetary policy, Mr. Deming commted that although the economy was not doing as well as the Committee might like, he did not see any significant basis for easing. With respect to the balance of pay ments, Mr. Deming said he agreed with Mr. Hayes that the central bank should do everything within reason, particularly in the area of short-term rates. Perhaps, under certain circumstances, the Committee should do more than it had been doing. On the other hand, he would not like at this time to see the short-term rate the major guide for policy; in his opinion, the Commit tee should key its policy primarily to the domestic economy. He thought what Mr. Mitchell had said at this meeting had a great deal of merit: the Committee should seek alternative means for dealing with the balance of payments problem. Mr. Deming said, with respect to the directive, that he was a little puzzled about suggestions to remove reference to the Cuban situation. The reference to imminent Treasury financing should be removed. The Cuban situation remained a factor, however, even though the situation perhaps was not as tense. Therefore, from deletion of the Treasury financing phrase, 11/13/62 -41 he would feel that the directive could be renewed. Mr. Swan reported that the Twelfth District was exhibiting somewhat mixed trends, but that there was a reasonably good level of activity. The data for October were still fragmentary. Going back to September, there was a 4 per cent increase in nonagriculture employment in the District from a year earlier, with an increase in defense-related employment of 10 per cent. In October, department store sales were apparently about unchanged from September. Steel production was down in October, and petroleum refin ing was down slightly. With respect to the financial picture, Mr. Swan said that in the past few weeks the reserve position of major District banks had tightened, and they had switched from being suppliers of Federal funds to net buyers. In the week of November 7th there was a substantial increase in borrowing from the Reserve Bank. Turning to monetary policy, Mr. Swan said the situation stood in delicate balance. The Committee was still faced with a domestic situation that showed no significant expansion. He could not see a basis for a significant switch toward a tighter policy despite problems in early November on the international side. He would think that during the next few weeks the Committee should supply reserves beyond seasonal requirements, which would imply a free reserve position of $400-$450 million. With respect to the directive, Mr. Swan said he would remove the references to Treasury refinancing and the Cuban crisis. 11/13/62 -42- Mr. Irons said that there had been no very significant changes in the Eleventh District economy, but that the level of activity had been favorable. Comparing the current level of economic activity with the fore cast made in late 1961, the economy in that District was not accomplishing what had been predicted. However, comparing the current levels with those of a year ago, the District was up in construction, department store trade, and agriculture, and conditions in the oil industry were not too bad. Turning to the financial picture in the Eleventh District, Mr. Irons reported that demand deposits were down and that there had been little bor rowing from the Reserve Bank. There was little concern on the part of the Reserve Bank\\'s directors with respect to the domestic economy, but growing concern with respect to the international situation. Mr. Irons said he was pretty much in agreement with Mr. Hayes\\' state ment. The Committee had to try to walk a tightrope as between domestic and international problems, but he was inclined to think it should avoid giving any less attention, from the standpoint of the rate structure, to the inter national situation. There was a risk in every approach, but he felt that less risk was involved in the domestic economy than on the international side. He would favor, for the next three-week period, continuing to follow current policy, but he felt the banking system was liquid and he would lean toward being a little less easy, though meeting essential needs for reserves. As to free reserves, he would say under $400 million; $300-$350 million would be all right. For the Treasury bill rate, he would say 2.75-2.85 per cent, with the Federal funds rate rather consistently at 3 per cent. He would not change the discount rate. 11/13/62 -43 With respect to the policy directive, Mr. Irons said he would take out the words relating to Treasury financing. With respect to phrases on the Cuban problem, he would prefer the passage of more time before making any changes. Mr. Ellis described business in New England as unsettled at a relatively high level. Department store sales were lagging behind last year, but automobile sales were strong. Personal income reached a peak in June and was leveling out. Employment had declined slightly in excess of seasonal expectations. In the banking field, demand deposits of weekly reporting member banks, on seasonally adjusted basis, had declined, but loan demand was up. Mr. Ellis said it seemed to him the Committee should be satisfied with the position of monetary policy. He found it difficult to recommend changing the present policy materially, even though recognizing the importance of Mr. Hayes\\' comments with relation to the international policy aspects. He would prefer to wait a while longer. With respect to the directive, he would strike out the phrases regarding the Treasury financing and the Cuban crisis. If that was done, the sense of the directive would come very close to no change in the position of policy. Mr. Balderston said he was of the view that the Committee should consider probing in the direction suggested by Mr. Hayes and Mr, Fulton. The goal of a balance in international payments seemed as far from attainment as it was a year ago. There was some continuing tendency for wage rates and 11/13/62 -44 Governmental costs to increase, and it was just not good enough to depend on European competitors being improvident and impractical. He was disturbed by the behavior of the stock market in recent days, which behavior appeared to be a matter of reacting to fright, and also that the Government would now spend more because of political and military uncertainties. As he pondered those matters, he came back to the question of liquidity, and he felt the amount of liquidity in the banks and economy at large was very great. There fore, as he looked at required reserves held against private deposits, which had increased since June by 3-1/2 per cent, he concluded that the time may have come to probe in the direction of a lower level of free reserves. Chairman Martin said that he had been impressed by the amount of thought reflected in the comments that had been made at this meeting. The discussion pointed up the difficulties of the period which, although perhaps no more difficult than many other periods, was nevertheless an extremely difficult one. Nothing said in the comments this morning had changed essentially the position at which he had arrived before coming into the meeting--a position that the present was not a good time for an overt change in monetary policy. Public psychology had shown several reversals during the past month. Observing these shifts, the Chairman said, it seemed to him that the Federal Reserve System had gained by having maintained a policy of stability in a period when the public had shifted from one extreme to another in a short period of time. Chairman Martin said that he sympathized with the views expressed by Mr. Hayes and would lean in the direction advocated by the latter if it 11/13/62 -45 were not for the pyschological repercussions that he thought he sensed. The views expressed by the members of the Committee seemed more evenly divided than had been the case for a considerable period of time. He doubted that anyone in the room would perceive the right answer to the problems; he did not pretend to do so, but his feeling at this particular time was that monetary policy, if anything, was too easy and may have been so for some little time. He was just as anxious as anyone to see further growth in the economy and to see an expansion in activity that would get rid of un utilized capacity. He was convinced, however, that easier money would not bring about these desired goals. The Chairman then cited a personal expe rience over the past week end that illustrated that banks were not only willing to extend credit but were soliciting loans when there was the slight est sign of a potential borrower. One result of this, he noted, was a lower ing of standards of credit in the lending business. This may not have gone to the point of justifying concern, but in his opinion some concern was warranted. Chairman Martin also commented that the problem of growth in the domestic economy and the solution to the balance of payments problem of this country should not be put on a basis of assigning priority to one over the other. The two problems essentially were one; the Committee was wrestling with the solution of both of them at the same time. He thought that the money market sensed this. In a sense, the Committee was caught between the \"bills only\" pressures and the \"buy long-term securities\" group. He doubted that any devices that might be used would effectively mark certain interest rates 11/13/62 -46 up and others down to deal with the contrasting objectives of domestic growth and the solution to the balance of payments problem. There had been a resurgence of business sentiment and activity within the last week or ten days, the Chairman noted, but no one could tell how long that would last. To base a change in monetary policy on a shift of the sort observed recently would not be desirable, he felt, and if he were to arrive at a policy deci sion entirely on his own, he would make no change at this point in monetary policy. To base a change in monetary policy on a shift of the sort observed recently would not be desirable, he felt, and if he were to arrive at a policy decision entirely on his own, he would make no change at this point in monetary policy, although if he were forced to choose between change in one direction or the other, he would have to come out on the side of slightly less ease rather than on the side of slightly more ease than at the present time. While concluding that the Federal Reserve should maintain the same policy at this point, Chairman Martin remarked that he did not believe that continuance of that policy indefinitely was going to provide the solution to the balance of payments problem. The time might come when the System would have to raise the discount rate in order to deal with the balance of payments problem. Turning to the Committee\\'s discussion, there was a close division of judgment in the views expressed this morning, with a wider gap in the views than he had observed for a long period of time. Several of the members were advocating a shift in policy to provide for greater ease, while several others were advocating a shift to provide for less ease and some wanted no change at all. No one was advocating a change at this time in the discount rate. 11/13/62 -47 With respect to the discount rate and the balance of payments problem, the Chairman said he believed interest rates to be the controlling force in the movements of funds. This might not appear to be so at any given time, but it was his belief that in the longer run the rates were a controlling force. This morning the Committee was between the \"easy money\" view and the \"easier money\" view. He saw no way of resolving the weight of these views other than to call for a vote on the general question. He then suggested that a vote be taken Ln which the members of the Committee would indicate whether they would vote for or against a change in the degree of ease called for by existing policy. On this question a total of five members of the Committee indicated that they would vote for no change (Messrs. Martin, Bryan, Deming, Ellis, and King), while six indicated that they would prefer to make some change in the present policy (Messrs. Balderston, Fulton, Hayes, Mills, Mitchell, and Robertson). Chairman Martin then suggested that to approach a closer under standing of the views he would present the question whether the Committee\\'s policy should be changed at this meeting to provide for a lesser degree of ease. On this question four members voted \"aye\", while seven voted against a change to a policy of less ease. (Messrs. Martin, Balderston, Fulton, and Hayes voted \"yes\", while Messrs. Bryan, Deming, Ellis, King, Mills, Mitchell, and Robertson voted against a change to a policy of less ease.) 11/13/62 -48 Chairman Martin next put the question of a change in policy to provide for a greater degree of ease, and on this question seven members voted against such a policy, with three in favor and one abstaining. Those voting against a change to a greater degree of ease were Messrs. Martin, Hayes, Balderston, Deming, Ellis, Fulton, and King; those voting for a greater degree of ease were Messrs. Mills, Mitchell, and Robertson; and Mr. Bryan did not vote. In the discussion that followed, Mr. Robertson stated that, while his basic inclination was toward a policy of somewhat greater ease, he would he strongly in favor of holding policy unchanged if the only practicable alternatives were a policy of no change or a policy of less ease. Accordingly, he was prepared to change his vote on the first question put to the Committee from a vote against no change to a vote in favor of no change in the present policy. Chairman Martin then called for any further comments with respect to the indications of views. In the absence of comment, he declared that the Secretary should record the Committee\\'s policy vote on the question of whether there should be a change in the present degree of ease as showing six members voting for no change (Messrs. Martin, Bryan, Deming, Ellis, King, and Robertson), and five voting for a change (Messrs. Balderston, Fulton, Hayes, Mills, and Mitchell). Of these five, Messrs. Balderston, Hayes, and Fulton would favor a lesser degree of ease, while Messrs. Mills and Mitchell would favor a greater degree of ease. 11/13/62 -49 With respect to his own position, the Chairman stated that, as he had indicated at the outset, he favored no change in the degree of ease. However, if it had been necessary to vote for a change to greater or lesser ease, he would have favored slightly less ease than at present. The Chairman then took up the question of the current economic policy directive to be issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, noting that some suggestions had been made that reference to the Treasury financing and to Cuba should be deleted from the directive issued at the meeting on October 23. The Chairman stated that he felt the present directive, with a deletion of the reference to the Treasury financing, could be used. Mr. Hayes had suggested a change which would move in the direction of less ease but, in view of the vote of the Committee against such a change, such wording would not be appropriate. During the ensuing discussion several suggestions of wording were presented. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the follow ing current economic policy directive: In view of the recent stability of economic activity, with a margin of underutilized resources and an absence of inflationary pressures, it is the current policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to encourage moderate further increase in bank credit and the money supply, while avoiding money market conditions unduly favorable to capital outflows internationally. It is also the Committee\\'s policy to cushion such unsettlement in money markets as may stem from international developments of an emergency or near emergency character. 11/13/62 -50- To implement this policy, operations for the System Open Market Account during the next three weeks shall be conducted with a view to providing moderate reserve expansion in the banking system and to fostering a steady tone in money markets. Votes for this action: Messrs. Martin, Balderston, Bryan, Deming, Ellis, Fulton, King, Mills, Mitchell, and Robertson. Vote against this action: Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes stated that his vote against the wording of the directive in the foregoing form was based on his feeling that the wording gave too little attention to the difficult international balance of payments situation and that it placed its main emphasis on the domestic situation. Chairman Martin noted that the next meeting of the Committee had been tentatively scheduled for December 4, 1962. Thereupon the meeting adjourned. Secretary ',\n",

Broida Assistant Secretary Howard H, Hackley General Counsel David B. Hexter Assistant General Counsel Guy E. Noyes Economist Daniel H. Brill, J.

Ratchford Upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was selected to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account until the adjournment of the first meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee after February 28, 1965. Upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, Robert W. Stone and Charles A. Coombs were selected to serve at the pleasure of the Federal Open Market Committee as Manager of the System Open Market Account and as Special Manager for foreign currency operations for such Account, respectively, it being understood that their selection was subject to their being satis factory to the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 3/3/64 Secretary\\'s Note: Advice was subsequently received that Messrs. Stone and Coombs were satisfactory to the Board of Directors of the New York Federal Reserve Bank for service in the respective capacities indicated. Upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the minutes of the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee held on January 28 and February 11, 1964, were approved. Consideration then was given to the continuing authorizations of the Committee, according to the customary practice of reviewing such matters at the first meeting in March of each year, and the actions set forth hereinafter were taken. Chairman Martin noted that the Secretariat had distributed, under date of February 24, 1964, a draft of a proposed new continuing authority directive relating to transactions in U. S. Government securities and bankers\\' acceptances, and he invited Mr. Young to comment on the nature of the changes recommended. Mr. Young said that the proposed revisions included an increase from $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the standing limitation specified in paragraph l(a) on changes in System Account holdings of U. S. Government securities between meetings of the Committee; and revisions in the language of the preamble of the directive and of paragraph l(a) that were intended to clarify the Committee\\'s intent and remove certain ambiguities. Two supporting memoranda had been attached to his memorandum of February 24; one, dated February 14, 1964, from Mr. Stone, giving the reasons for the proposal to increase the standing limitation on changes in security holdings, and one, dated February 24, 1964, from 3/3/64 -5 the Secretariat, setting forth the reasons for the proposed language revisions. (Note: Copies of these memoranda have been placed in the files of the Committee.) Following Mr. Young\\'s remarks, Mr. Mills said that the Committee might recall t.hat for a long time he had been distressed over the directive and had offered suggestions for changes because he thought it lacked clarity and led to confusion regarding its meaning. He moved that the Committee resume the type of directive which had been in effect at the beginning of 1961 and in use for many years previously. He thought that in those directives the intent of the Committee with respect to current policy was clearly expressed by clause (b) of paragraph 1. For example, the clause in effect in the latter part of 1961 provided for open market operations with a view \"to encouraging credit expansion so as to promote fuller utilization of resources, while giving consideration to international factors.\" Mr. Mills also moved that the Committee resume the statements of operating policies that were in effect from 1953 until December 19, 1961. Mr. Robertson seconded Mr. Mills\\' motion, expressing the view that the former type of directive provided greater restrictions on and better guidelines for operations in the System Open Market Account than did the continuing authority directives of the more recent type, which provided blanket auttority and served no purpose. He thought the Committee would recall that he had taken the same position on earlier occasions. 3/3/64 -6 In the ensuing discussion, Mr. Balderston asked whether the focus of Messrs. Mills\\' and Robertson\\'s objections was on the con tinuing authority directive or on the current economic policy directive. Mr. Mills rep.ied that he was concerned both with the directive that was issued to the Manager at each meeting, and, of greater importance, with the continuing directive that provided operating guidelines. Mr. Robertson said that his remarks at this stage were directed solely to the continuing directive. Mr. Mitchell observed that he felt the current policy directives the Committee had been issuing were unsatisfactory; the Manager was at times given inconsistent instructions and was forced to make policy judgments if he was to operate at all. Mr. Mitchell said he did not know whether Mr. Mills\" proposal would provide the solution, but he felt something should be done. He thought that the Committee\\'s staff might be able to suggest some means of dealing with the problem. Chairman Martin said he thought all members of the Committee were interested in improving the form of the current policy directive, but the question was how to do so. He personally would not want to return to the procedures the Committee had followed earlier, which in his opinion were inadequate. The problem facing the Committee was the perennial one of language and the meaning attached to words. Mr. Hayes commented that in his judgment a detailed defense of present procedures was not necessary. It seemed to him that the change 3/3/64 -7 the Committee had made from its former procedures was clearly an improvement. While present procedures we::e not perfect, on the whole they were working well, and he failed to see the basis on which Mr. Mitchell objected to them. Mr. Mitchell said that under present procedures one might argue that there were occasions when the responsibilities of the Open Market Committee were in fact transferred to the Manager of the Account, and Mr. Hayes replied that he could not agree with such an argument. Chairman Martin observed that since the subject under discussion was so important it was desirable for everyone to have an opportunity to comment on it. Such a discussion was articularly appropriate today, since this was the Committee\\'s organization meeting. He noted that Mr. Young had been concerned with the problem of the directive and he invited him to comment. Mr. Young said he thought that the nature of the instruct ons given the Manager should be reviewed intensively from a technical standpoint from time to time. The problem was a continuing one to which no one as yet had found the solutior. If the Committee so desired, it could designate a staff group to take the matter under study and make recommendations for the Committee\\'s consideration. Mr. Ellis agreed that the Committee should re-examine its techniques from time to time, and at least once each year. He felt the 3/3/64 -8 Committee had made progress when it had established its present techniques, and that it probably could make further progress. He favored the proposal that a staff committee be appointed to suggest further improvements. Mr. Irans thought the Committee\\'s present procedure and directive were much better than those used previously. He did not consider them perfect, and he agreed that they could, and perhaps should, be studied periodically. It might be desirable to have a staff committee appointed for this purpose at this time. However, he was not dissatisfied with present procedures. Mr. Swan said that he felt much the same as Mr. Irons. The present continuing authority directive was better than the previous one, he thought, ard perhaps could be improved further. With respect to the current directive, he tended to share Mr. M:tchell\\'s attitude. He would like to see the current directive formulated in more precise terms, but he did not know just how to do so. He did not favor returning to the former procedures. Mr. Deming observed that he had no real criticism of the continuing authority directive, and he would not want to resume the operating policy statements as Mr. Mills had suggested. However, he agreed with Mr. Mitchell that the current policy directive was not as clear-cut as it might be, and that it should be possible to improve it. He thought this was something the Committee usefully could give attention to. 3/3/64 -9- Mr. Scanlon said that he agreed with Mr. Irons. However, he thought that it would be desirable to ask the staff to make specific proposals for Committee consideration. Chairman Martin commented that the staff had been doing that; for this meeting they had prepared alternate drafts of the current directive that. would be distributed at the appropriate time. But a thorough review of the alternatives would be a rather difficult operation, since twelve people had to be satisfied. The Committee had once attempted a procedure under which it reconvened in the afternoon to review a draft of the directive prepared by the staff on the basis of the discussion in the morning session, but this had not proved wholly satisfactory. Perhaps some better procedure could be devised. Mr. Mitchell said that he had had a somewhat different quetion in mind. It seemed to him that there were some typical problems in the directive, involving conflicts between objectives specified in terms of interest rates, and money market conditions on the one hand, and in terms of bank reserves on the other. He hoped that the staff could suggest ways by which the Committee could avoid such conflicts. Mr. Clay said that he did not think the directive could be made perfectly precise. He often had felt sympathy for the Manager in view of the nature of his instructions. On the whole, however, he thought the Manager had produced about the results that the Committee had intended. While he agreed that the Committee should continue to struggle 3/3/64 -10 for improvement in the directive, he did not think the present procedures were bad. Mr. Wayne commented that it would be useful for the staff end the Committee to consider this subject and to circulate memoranda, but it was his personal feeling that the search for precision in the directive was futile. Unless the Committee was prepared to meet daily, its instructions had to be general in nature. The real problem, he thought, was not one of the degree of precision in the directive, but of difference in philosophy and views among the members of the Committee itself. Some members would favor returning to a \"bills preferably\" policy, and they would like to have the directive so drawn. Other members would not favor such a course, and they would not wart the directive so drawn. In his opinion the present form of directive was an improvement over the former one, and he would not want to change it at this time, although he had no objection to discussion of the matter. Mr. Shepardson said he felt much the same way as Mr. Wayne. He thought the present directive was definitely an improvement over the previous one. He agreed that the subject should be studied from time to time and that it would be desirable for the staff to be given a specific assignment for such a study now, with their report scheduled for consideration and discussion by the Committee. Until then, he would favor retaining the present form of the directive. 3/3/64 -11- Mr. Robertson noted that the discussion had been broadened to relate to the current directive as well as the continuing authority directive. He then made the following statement: To my mind some revision in the language of our current policy directive to the Manager is very much in order for three reasons: (1) to gradually work away from so intense a focus on stable money market conditions as our prime operational target; (2) to reorient our attention towards more objective reserve measures, in so far as our present abilities allow us to estimate their current magnitude and the levels most appropriate for promoting the desired per formance of the over-all economy; (3) to recognize more explicitly the fact that money market and reserve developments may not always unfold in the pattern we had in mind, and to give the Manager guidance for some appropriate redirecting of his operations on such occasions. When. it comes to the precise wording to achieve these purposes, I have not been able to improve the phraseology I suggested about a year ago. You may think that it has not improved with age, but let me reiterate it nonetheless as a way of exemplifying my thinking: \"To implement this policy, operations for the System Open Market Account during the next three weeks shall be conducted with a view to maintaining marginal reserve availability at about the average level thus far this year, fluctuating as necessary to moderate substantial swings in money market conditions and to partly offset any tendency for aggregate reserve expansion to deviate substantially from the average rate for 1963 as a whole.\" 3/3/64 -12 To give you a concrete idea of the reserve statistics which this kind of directive would be asking the Desk to keep in mind, let me report that thus far this year free reserves have averaged about $135 million and borrowings around $;70 million and that total reserve expansion for the year 1963 as a whole averaged a shade over 3 per cent. I would not want to include these specific figures in any directive, because I would not want either the Manager or the public to be Led into thinking that the Committee wished to achieve any precise statistical objectives, or that it had any illusions that the Manager could in fact hit such statistical targets even if they were desired. Rather, I think the purpose of our directive should be to suggest, in clearly objective terms, the kind of money market and reserve climate that the Desk should be seeking to achieve and the general way in which the Desk should modify its operations if resul:s do not turn out as desired. Mr. Daane said that he had a great deal of sympathy with Mr. Wayne\\'s position. The Committee had been struggling with this problem for a long time, and, it seemed, the more it strove for precision in wording the more it retrogressed. He felt that the Comittee members sometimes failed to indicate clearly to the Desk the tenor of their objectives and philosophy To his mind this, rather than the lack of precise reserve or rate targets in the directive, was the real gap. He agreed with Mr. Hayes that the Committee had not abdicated from its responsibilities in favor of the Desk, and while he thought the Committee could give clearer guidance to the Desk, he doubted that the appropriate mechanism lay in making the wording of the directive more precise. Mr. Hickman said he agreed essentially with Mr. Daane and others who had taken a similar position. He thought that the present continuing authority directive was better than the previous one. There was always 3/3/64 -13 room for improvement in the current policy directive, but since Committee members did not agree in general philosophy or with respect to particular objectives, it was necessary to cast the language of the directive in general terms; in order to reach some measure of consensus. He thought that the operations of the Desk yielded a remarkably accurate reflection of the Committee\\'s intentions. Mr. Bopp remarked that he would prefer a more precise directive, but it should be cast in terms of magnitudes over which the Account Manager had direct control, such as the amount and composition of the System portfolio or particular market rates. He did not believe that precise targets should be set in terms of such variables as reserves or the volume of money, over which the Manager had no direct control, certainly not in the short run. The directives often specified in consistent objectives, and there was room for improvement in this connection. But any directive had to leave the Manager some degree of flexibility in operations. Mr. Bryan said that he saw several separate problems. One was to give directions to the Manager in terms sufficiently precise to make clear that the Committee was not delegating its powers to him. Unfortunately the Committee had never been able to agree on what criteria were most appropriate, and, he thought, for good reason. He personally had experimented with criteria drawn in terms of free reserves, nonborrowed reserves, and reserves against private deposits, but he had not gotten far because of the difficulties inherent in the problem. 3/3/64 -14 Secondly, there was a problem beyond that of criteria--namely, that of the general philosophy on which the Committee operated. Behind the old form of directive there had been a concept of a free market in which it was assumed that, while intervention by the central bank was necessary, it should occur at the point at which it would have the least impact on the market. The Committee operated on the reserve base, taking into account these things that needed to be taken into account, such as employment, the general price level, and so forth. He thought the idea of the free market was a good one and the least dangerous to the central bank in the long run. But the Committe. had received almost no academic or other support for this position Moreover, the Committee had found that \"bills preferably\" simply did not suit its policy objectives as time passed, and accordingly it had changed. Mr. Bryan said he was afraid that in the long run the Committee would find itself in difficulty as a result of that change. Mr. Shuford said he, as everyone else would like to give more definitive instructions to the Desk; he was sure that such instructions would be helpful to them. The Committee was continually working on the problem of improving its instructions. He was in accord with the observation of Mr. Wayne that the basic problem was one of differences in philosophy and approach, and differences of view with respect to the variables that should be given the most consideration. He had talked with economists who urged that the Committee use specific guidelines in 3/3/64 -15 its operations, but he had been. interested to note that each had a dif ferent set of guidelines in mind. This sort of problem probably would always exist in an evolving economy. Mr. Shuford said he thought the Committee should work toward de veloping more definitive directions to the Desk. The Committee had made a little progress in this direction, and in general the Desk had operated in the manner the Committee had intended. In his opinion Mr. Robertson\\'s suggestion was helpful, and he agreed that study of the directive by the Committee staff would be constructive. He thought this was a problem the Committee would have to continue to work with; as long as the economy was dynamic and changing, and there were differences of opinion as to what yardsticks deserved most attention, it would be difficult to formu late explicit instructions. Mr. Balderston said that his approach to the continuing authority directive was somewhat like that expressed by Mr. Bryan. He viewed this directive as equivalent to a set of by-laws, subject to review once a year and providing the legal basis upon which the Desk operated. For many years after coming to the Board he had felt that the conclusion of the Ad Hoc Subcommittee that it would be desirable to give the dealers the confidence necessary to operate as dealers and not as brokers was important; and he had been among those who had defended the bills pref erably doctrine as a philosophy that made for greater depth, breadth, and resiliency in the market and for a healthier market. However, he had come 3/3/64- -16 to feel eventually that, although the Committee said it was not doctrinaire in its views, it was considered to be so by many others. Mr. Balderston said he felt the present continuing authority directive was an advance over the one in effect earlier, and he had not seen any evil effects flowing from it. As to the current directive, he shared the feeling expressed by several others that there often were internal inconsistencies in its language, and he favored giving serious consideration to Mr. Robertson\\'s proposal. He did not know whether the Committee could go much beyond calling for about the same degree of ease, or more or Less ease. When the Committee attempted to be more specific, difficulties arose from the differences among the members\\' general philosophies. Mr. Hayes said that in his judgment the problem facing the Committee was not primarily one of wording in the directive, which could be solved by having the staff give the Committee a number of alternative drafts. The main problem was one of self-education by the members with respect to the nature of the measures--whether bank reserves, liquidity, the money supply, time deposits or whatever--that were of real importance in the effort to implement the Committee\\'s objectives through the variables that the Committee could affect directly. A continuing flow of studies and memoranda from the Committee\\'s staff and from others would contribute greatly to this general process of education. It seemed to Mr. Hayes that that was the main avenue through which the Committee could get a fruitful discussion of criteria. 3/3/64 -17 Chairman Martin observed that the problem was extremely complicated, and was made even more complicated by the fact that the Treasury was continually operating in the market. The difficulties of meshing the two sets of operations was a source of constant concern to both the Committee and the Desk. He thought the Committee had to keep working on the problem of the directive--all aspects of it--to see what could be pulled together. It would be desirable, he thought, to have Mr. Young and the Secretariat review the matter in the light of today\\'s discu:sion, and to prepare a memorandum dealing, among other things, with the problem that Mr. Mitchell had noted with respect to inconsistency in the instructions contained in the directive. The Chairman then called for a vote on Mr. Mills\\' motion, with the following result: Votes for the motion: Messrs. Mills and Robertson. Votes against the motion: Messrs. Martin, Hayes, Balderston, Daane, Hickman, Mitchell, Shepardson, Shuford, Swan, and Wayne. Mr. Robertson observed that he had voted for Mr. Mills\\' motion not because he thought the previous form of the directive was perfect, but because he considered it better than the present form. He felt that a thorough review of both the continuing authority and current policy directives was desirable. Chairman Martin said that it was useful to have had this matter raised today; he thought the discussion had been valuable. While he 3/3/64 -18 would not like to see the Committee return to its previous procedure with respect to the directive, it was clear from the discussion that the present procedure was not regarded as wholly satisfactory. He would hope that the Committee would continue to work actively on the matter. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, it was voted, with Messrs. Mills and Robertson dissenting, to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following continuing authority directive relating to transactions in U. S. Government securities and bankers\\' acceptances: 1. The Federal Open Market Comm\\'.ttee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent current economic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee. (a) To buy or sell United States Government securities in the open market, from or to Government securities dealers and foreign ard international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices and, for such Account, to exchange maturing United States Government securities with the Treasury or allow them to mature without replacement; provided that the aggregate amount of such securities held in such Account at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action is taken with respect to a current economic policy directive shall not be increased or decreased by more than $1.5 billion during the period commencing with the opening of business on the day following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting. (b) To buy or sell prime bankers\\' acceptances of the kinds designated in the Regulation of the Federal 3/3/64 -19 Open Market Committee in the open market, from or to acceptance dealers and foreign accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at market dis count rates; provided that the aggregate amount of bankers\\' acceptances held at any one time shall not exceed $75 million or 10 per cent of the total of bankers\\' acceptances outstanding as shown in the most recent acceptance survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. (c) To buy United States Government securities with maturities of 24 months or less at the time of purchase, and prime bankers\\' acceptances with maturities of 6 months or less at the time of purchase, from non bank dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities or acceptances in 15 calendar days or less, at rates not less than (1) the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time such agreement is entered into, or (2) the average issuing rate on the most recent issue of 3-month Treasury bills, whichever is the lower; provided that in the event Government securities covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall to sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account; and provided further that in the event bankers\\' acceptances covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the seller, they shall continue to be held by the Federal Reserve Bank or shall be sold in the open market. 2. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to purchase directly from the Treasury for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (with discretion, in cases where it seems desirable, to issue participations to one or more Federal Reserve Banks) such amounts of special short-term certificates of indebtedness as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury; provided that the rate charged on such certificates shall be a rate 1/4 of 1 per cent below the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of such purchases, and provided further that the total amount of such certificates held at any one time by the Federal Reserve Banks shall not exceed $500 million. 3/3/64 -20 Upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the Authorization Regarding Open Market Transactions in Foreign Currencies, as reaffirmed March 5, 1963, and the Guidelines for System Foreign Currency Operations, as amended May 28, 1963, were reaffirmed: AUTHORIZATION REGARDING OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES Pursuant to Section 12A of the Federal Reserve Act and in accordance with Section 214.5 of Regulation N (as amended) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Open Market Committee takes the following action governing open market operations incident to the opening and maintenance by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (hereafter sometimes referred to as the New York Bank) of accounts with foreign central banks. I. Role of Federal Reserve Bank of New York The New York Bank shall execute all transactions pursuant to this authorization (hereafter sometimes referred to as transactions in foreign currencies) for the System Open Market Account, as defined in the Regulation of the Federal Open Market Committee. II. Basic Purposes of Operations The basic purposes of System operations in and holdings of foreign currencies are: (1) To help safeguard the value of the dollar in international exchange markets; (2) To aid in making the existing system of international payments more efficient and in avoiding disorderly conditions in exchange markets; (3) To further monetary cooperation with central banks of other countries maintaining convertible currencies, with the International Monetary Fund, and with other international payments institutions; (4) Together with these banks and institutions, to help moderate temporary imbalances in international payments that may adversely affect monetary reserve positions; and (5) In the long run, to make possible growth in the 3/3/64 -21- liquid assets available to international money markets in accordance with the needs of an expanding world economy. III. Specific Aims of Operations Within the basic purposes set forth in Section II, the transact.ions shall be conducted with a view to the following specific aims: (1) To offset or compensate, when appropriate, the effects on U.. S. gold reserves or dollar liabil ities of disequilibrating fluctuations in the international flow of payments to or from the United States, and especially those that are deemed to reflect temporary forces or transitional market unsettlement; (2) Totemper and smooth out abrupt changes in spot exchange rates and moderate forward premiums and discounts judged to be disequilibrating; (3) To supplement international exchange arrangements such as those made through the International Monetary Fund; and (4) In the long run, to provide a means whereby reciprocal holdings of foreign currencies may contribute to meeting needs for international liquidity as required in terms of an expanding world economy. IV. Arrangements with Foreign Centra. Banks In making operating arrangements with foreign central ba-ks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the New York Bank snall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. The Bank shall instruct foreign central banks regarding the investment of such holdings in excess of minimum working balances in accordance with Section 14(e) of the Federal Reserve Act. The Bank shall consult with foreign central banks on coordination of exchange operations. Any agreements or understandings concerning the administra tion of the accounts maintained by the New York Bank with the central banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N (as amended) are to be referred for review 3/3/64 -22 and approval to the Committee, subject to the provision of Section VIII, paragraph 1, below. V. Authorized Currencies The New York Bank is authorized to conduct transactions for System Account in such currencies and within the limits that the Federal Open Market Committee may from time to time specify. VI. Methods of Acquiring and Selling foreign Currencies The New York Bank is authorized to purchase and sell foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the Stabilization Fund of the Secretary of the Treasury established by Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 and with foreign monetary authorities. Unless the Bank is otherwise authorized, all transactions shall be at prevailing market rates. VII. Participation of Federal Reserve Banks All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3 G (1) of the Board of Governors\\' Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944. VIII. Administrative Procedures The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes a Subcommittee consisting of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Committee and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors (or in the absence of the Chairman or of the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governcrs the members of the Board designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee his alternate) to give instructions to the Special Manager, within the guidelines issued by the Committee, in cases in which it is necessary to reach a decision on operations before the Committee can be consulted. All actions authorized under the preceding paragraph shall be promptly reported to the Committee. 3/3/64 -23- The Committee authorizes the Chairman, and in his absence the Vice Chairman of the Committee, and in the absence of both, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors: (1) With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the Secretary; (2) To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary on such policy matters as may relate to the Secretary\\'s responsibilities; (3) From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems. IX. Special Manager of the System Open Market Account A Special Manager of the Open Market Account for foreign currency operations shall be selected in accordance with the establisted procedures of the Federal Open Market Committee fcr the selection of the Manager of the System Open Market Account. The Special Manager shall direct that all transactions in foreign currencies and the amounts of all holdings in each authorized foreign currency be reported daily to designated staff officials of the Committee, and .hall regularly consult witn the designated staff officials of the Committee on current tendencies in the flow of international payments and on current developments in foreign exchange marke:s. The Special Manager and the designated staff officials of the Committee shall arrange for the prompt transmittal to the Committee of all statistical and other information relating to the transactions in and the amounts of holdings of foreign currencies for review by the Committee as to conformity with its instructions. The Special Manager shall include in his reports to the Committee a statement of bank balances and investments payable in foreign currencies, a statement of net profit or loss on transactions to date, and a summary of outstanding unmatured contracts in foreign currencies. 3/3/64 -24- X. Transmittal of Information to Treasury Department The staff officials of the Federal Open Market Committee shall transmit all pertinent information on System foreign currency transactions to designated officials of the Treasury Department. XI. Amendment of Authorization The Federal Open Market Committee may at any time amend or rescind this authorization. GUIDELINES FOR SYSTEM FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS 1. Holdings of Foreign Currencies Until otherwise authorized, the System will limit its holdings of foreign currencies to that amount necessary to enable its operations to exert a market influence. Holdings of larger amounts will be authorized only when the U. S. balance of international payments attains a sufficient surplus to permit the ready accumulation of holdings of major con vertible currencies. Holdings of a currency shall generally be kept sufficient to meet forward contracts in that currency (exclusive of con tracts made under parallel arrangements with foreign monetary authorities which provide their own cover) expected to mature in the following three-week period. Foreign currency holdings above a certain minimum shall be invested as far as practicable in conformity with Section 14(e) of the Federal Reserve Act. 2. Exchange Transactions System exchange transactions shall be geared to pressures of payments flows so as to cushion or moderate disequilibrating movements of funds and their destablizing effects on U. S. and foreign official reserves and on exchange markets. In general, these transactions shall be geared to pressures connected with movements that are expected to be reversed in 3/3/64 -25- the foreseeable future; when expressly authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee, they may also be geared on a short-term basis to pressures connected with other movements. Subject to express authorization of the Committee, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York may enter into reciprocal arrangements with foreign central banks on exchange transactions (\"swap\" arrangements), which arrangements may be wholly or in part an a standby basis. Drawings made by either party under a reciprocal arrange ment shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay. The New York Bank shall, as a usual practice, purchase and sell authorized currencies at prevailing market rates without trying to establish rates that appear to be out of line with underlyirg market forces. If market offers to sell or buy intensify as System holdings increase or decline, this shall be regarded as a clear signal for a review of the System\\'s evaluation of international payments flows. This review might suggest a temporary change in System holdings of a particular convertible currency and possibly direct exchange transactions with the foreign central bank involved to be able to accommodate a larger demand or supply. Starting operations at a time when the United States is not experiencing a net inflow of any e igible foreign currency may require that initial System holdings (apart from sums that might be acquired from the Stabilization Fund) be purchased directly from foreign central banks. It shall be the practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions in order that System transactions do not conflict with those being undertaken by foreign monetary authorities. 3. Transactions in Spot Exchanges The guiding principle for transactions in spot exchange shall be that, in general, market movements in exchange rates, within the limits established in the International Monetary 3/3/64 -26- Fund Agreement or by central bank practices, index affirmatively the interaction of underlying economic forces and thus serve as efficent guides to current financial decisions, private and public. Temporary or transitional fluctuations in payments flows may be cushioned or moderated whenever they occasion market anxieties, or undesirable speculative activity in foreign exchange transactions, or excessive leads and lags in international payments. Special factors making for exchange market instabilities include (i) responses to short-run increases in international political tension, (ii) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, or (iii) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions. Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions are appropriate if the Special Manager, in consultation with the Federal Open Market Committee, or in an emergency with the members of the Committee designated for that purpose, reaches a judgment that they may help to re-establish supply and demand balance at a level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments Whenever supply or demand persists in influencing exchange rates in one direction, System transactions should be modified, curtailed, or eventually discontinued pending a re assessment by the Committee of supply and demand forces. 4. Transactions in Forward Exchange Occasion to engage in forward transactions will arise mainly when forward premiums or discounts are inconsistent with interest rate differentials and are giving rise to a disequilibrating movement of short-term funds, or when it is deemed appropriate to supplement existing market facilities for forward cover as a means of encouraging the retention or accumulation of dollar holdings abroad. Proposals of the Special Manager to initiate forward operations shall be submitted to the Committee for advance approval. For such operations, the New York Bank may, where authorized, take over from the Stabilization Fund outstanding contracts for forward sales or purchases of authorized currencies. 3/3/64 -27 The New York Bank may also, where authorized, purchase currencies through forward transactions for the purpose of allowing greater flexibility in covering commitments under reciprocal currency agreements. The New York Bank may further, where authorized, purchase and sell currencies through forward as well as spot transactions for the purpose of settling commitments denominated in one currency by means of utilizing the Bank\\'s holdings of another currency. 5. Exchange Rates Insofar as practicable, the New York Bank shall purchase a currency through spot transactions at or below its par value, and should lower the rate at which it is prepared to purchase a currency as its holdings of that currency approach the estab lished maximum. The Bank shall also, where practicable, sell a currency through spot transactions at rates at or above its par value, and should raise the rate at which it is prepared to sell a currency as its holdings of that currency approach zero. Spot transactions at rates other than those set forth in the preceding paragraphs shall be specially authorized by the members of the Committee designated in Section VIII of the Authorization for Open Market Transactions in Foreign Currencies. Upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the following con tinuing authority directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with respect to foreign currency operations was approved: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is authorized and directed to purchase and sell through spot transactions any or all of the following currencies in accordance with the Guidelines on System Foreign Currency Operations reaffirmed by the Federal Open Market Committee on March 3, 1964; provided that the aggregate amount of foreign currencies held under reciprocal currency arrangements shall not exceed $2.05 billion equivalent at any one time, and provided further that the aggregate amount of foreign currencies held as a result of 3/3/64 -28 outright purchases shall not exceed $130 million equivalent at any one time: Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Netherlands guilders Swiss francs Belgian francs Canadian dollars Austrian schillings Swedish kronor Japanese yen The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is also authorized and directed to operate in any or all of the foregoing currencies in accordance with the Guidelines and up to a combined total of $150 million equivalent, by means of: (a) purchases through forward transactions, for the purpose of allowing greater flexibility in covering commitments under reciprocal currency agreements; (b) purchases and sales through forward as well as spot transactions, for the purpose of utilizing its holdings of one currency for the settlement of commitments denominated in other currencies; and (c) purchases through spot transactions and sales through forward transactions, for the purpose of restraining short-term outflows of funds induced by arbitrage considerations. The Federal Reserve Bank of New Ycrk is also authorized and directed to make purchases through spot transactions, including purchases from the U. S. Stabilization Fund, and concurrent sales through forward transactions to the U. S. Stabilization Fund, of any of the foregoing currencies in which the U. S. Treasury has outstanding indebtedness, in accordance with the Guidelines and up to a total of $100 million equivalent. Purchases may be at rates above par, and both purchases and sales are to be made at the same rates. 3/3/64 -29 In presenting for approval the procedures with respect to allocations of the System Open Market Account, Chairman Martin commented that no changes were proposed from the procedures approved on December 3, 1963. Mr. Mills inquired if that was really the disposition of the Committee. His recollection was that the present allocation formula had been adopted on December 3 as a temporary measure, for a period of two or three months, to carry over the year end. There had been some differences of opinion then, and his own position had been that it would be preferable to follow the law Literally and adopt the alternative mentioned in clause (c) of a memorandum prepared by Messrs. Stone and Farrell under date of November 27, 1963: \"to choose to let intra-weekly deficiencies occur without attempting remedial adjustments.\" When deficiencies occurred at Federal Reserve Banks, they would be recorded and appropriate taxes paid. Instead, a formula had been accepted, on a temporary basis as he understood it, under which the allocations were shuffled .round to disguise the facts and to avoid the deficiencies that otherwise would have occurred. Mr. Stone noted that the procedures that had been in effect before December 3, 1963, specified that, to avoid a deficiency at a Reserve Bank on a statement date, a special \"as of\" adjustment would be undertaken the following morning, before the books for the statement date had been closed. Such procedures did not extend this \"as of\" adjustment to any other day 3/3/64 -30 of the veek. It had seemed to the Account Management that intra-weekly deficiencies would be likely to occur in the period between December 3 and the end of the year. If they did occur, that fact would be noted in the Board\\'s Annual Report, scheduled for publication in March 1964. The question put to the Committee then was whether it wanted to have the fact of a Reserve Bank deficiency publi,,hed in March. There had been extensive discussion of the matter at the joint meeting of the Board and the Reserve Bank Presidents on the afternoon of December 3, following which the meeting of the Open Market Committee had been reconvened and an alternative adopted under which the Account Management was instructed to make \"as of\" adjustments to avoid deficiencies--whether on a statement date or not. It had been suggested then that sometime during 1964 the question should be reviewed of permitting deficiencies to occur, which would require their publication in the Board\\'s Annual Report covering 1964. The thought was that the public would be made aware by this means that a problem was developing with respect to the reserves of the F deral Reserve Banks, and perhaps a process of discussion would be generated and a fund of understanding built up, so that there would be less adverse reaction if the time came when there simply were not enough reserves in the System to avoid deficiencies on statement dates. Mr. Scanlon said that he happened to have been one whose view at the December meeting differed from that of the majority, but he had not thought that there was anything temporary about the new allocation 3/3/64 -31 procedure. He had accepted it as continuing indefinitely until the Committee chose to make another change. Mr. Sherman recalled that the allocation procedure had been discussed briefly at the December 3 Open Market meeting and more extensively at meetings of the Board and of the Board jointly with the Presidents. The discussion ran to the question of whether either the Board or the Reserve Banks felt that it was desirable, as a matter of System policy, to permit deficiencies to occur and taxes to be levied on the Reserve Banks and to have the facts published in their respective publications. A rather novel suggestion for a different approach to the question of allocating reserves had been made, Mr. Sherman said, and some thought had been given to this suggestion by the staff. But he believed no memorandum or specific proposal for a change was being prepared at present. Chairman Martin observed that the discussion pointed up the need for further study of the subject, with a view to consideration at some later time. He thought it would be a mistake to return now to the previous allocation procedure. After further discussion, upon motion duly made and seconded, with Mr. Mills dissenting, the procedures with respect to allocations of the System Open Market Account as approved December 3, 1963, were reaffirmed. The procedures read as follows: 3/3/64 -32 1. Securities in the Syster Open Market Account shall be reallocated on the last business day of each statement week and of each month by means of adjustments proportionate to the adjustmerts that would have been required to equalize approx imately the average combined reserve ratios of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks based on the most recent available five business day\\'s reserve ratio figures. 2. The Board\\'s staff shall calculate, in the morning of each business day, the reserve ratios of each Bank after allowing for the indicated effects of the settlement of the Interdistrict Settlement Fund for the preceding day. If these calculations should disclose a deficiency in the reserve ratio of any Bank, the Board\\'s staff shall inform the Manager of the System Open Market Account, who shall make a special adjustment as of the previous day to restore the combined reserve ratio of that Bank to the average of all the Banks or to such higher level as may be necessary to eliminate the deficiency in note or deposit reserves. However, such adjustments shall not be made beyond the point where a deficiency would be created at any other Bank. Such adjustments shall be offset against the participation of the Bank or Banks best able to absorb the additional amount or, at the discretion of the Manager, against the participation of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Board\\'s staff and the Bank or Banks concerned shall then be notified of the amounts involved and the Interdistrict Settlement Fund shall be closed after giving effect to the adjustments as of the preceding business day. 3. Until the next reallocation the Account shall be apportioned on the basis of the ratios determined in paragraph 1, after allowing for any adjustments as provided for in paragrapn 2. 4. Profits and losses on the sale of securities from the Account shall be allocated on the day of delivery of the secu rities sold on the basis of each Bank\\'s current holdings at the opening of business on that day. Mr. Mills said that he dissented from this action because of the matter of principle involved; he did not approve the continuance of procedures that in his judgment were not consistent with either the spirit or the letter of the statute. He had not dissented at the time of the 3/3/64 -33 adoption of the present allocation procedure on December 3, 1963, because it had been his belief that the action was temporary, and that the matter would be reviewed after the year end. Mr. Stone commented that he was not sure that the basic iss.es had changed much since December, but he would undertake to review the Stone-Farrell memorandum of November 27, 1963, see whether any changes were indicated, and lay the matter before the Committee again. The authorization for distribution of periodic reports prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the Federal Open Market Committee was presented for consideration and approval. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unamimous vote, authorization was given for the following distribution: 1. The Members of the Board of Governors. 2. The Presidents of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks. 3. Officers of the Federal Open Ma;ket Committee. *4. The Secretary and the Under Secretary of the Treasury. *5. The Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs and the Deputy Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs. *6. The Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury working on debt management problems. *7. The Fiscal Assistant Secrecary of the Treasury. 8. The Director of the Division of Bank Operations of the Board of Governors. 9. The officer in charge of research at each of the Federal Reserve Banks not represented by its President on the Federal Open Market Committee. Weekly reports of open market operations only. 3/3/64 -34- 10. The alternate member of the Federal Open Market Committee from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; the Assistant Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York working under the Manager of the System Account; the Managers of the Securities Department of the New York Bank; the officer in charge and Assistant Vice President of the Research Department of the New York Bank; and the confidential files of the New York Bank as the Bank selected to execute transactions for the Federal Open Market Committee. 11. With the approval of a member of the Federal Open Market Committee or any other President of a Federal Reserve Bank, with notice to the Secretary, any other employee of the Board of Governors or of a Federal Reserve Bank. The Committee reaffirmed by unanimous vote the authorization, first given on March 1, 1951, for the Chairman to appoint a Federal Reserve Bank to operate the System Open Market Account temporarily in case the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is unable to function. The following resolution to provide for the continued operation of the Federal Open Market Committee during an emergency was re affirmed by unanimous vote: In the event of war or deferse emergency, if the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Federal Open Market Committee (or in the event of the unavailability of both of them, the Secretary or Acting Secretary of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) certifies that as a result of the emergency the available number of regular members and regular alternates of the Federal Open Market Committee is less than seven, all powers and functions of the said Committee shall be performed and exercised by, and authority to exercise such powers and functions is hereby delegated to, an Interim Committee, subject to the following terms and conditions: Such Interim Committee shall consist of seven members, com prising each regular member and regular alternate of the Federal Open Market Committee then available, together with an additional number, sufficient to make a total of seven, which shall be made up in the following order of priority from those available: 3/3/64 -35- (1) each alternate at large (as defined below); (2) each President of a Federal Reserve Bank not then either a regular member or an alternate; (3) each First Vice President of a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that (a) within each of the groups referred to in clauses (1), (2), and (3) priority of selection shall be in numerical order according to the numbers of the Federal Reserve Districts, (b) the President and the First Vice President of the same Federal Reserve Bank shall not serve at the same time as members of the Interim Committee, and (c) whenever a regular member or regular alternate of the Federal Open Market Committee or a person having a higher priority as indicated in clauses (1), (2), and (3) becomes avail able he shall become a member of the Interim Committee in the place of the person then on the Interim Committee having the lowest priority. The Interim Committee is hereby authorized to take action by majority vote of those present whenever one or more members thereof are present, provided that an affirmative vote for the action taken is cast by at least one regular member, regular alternate or President of a Fedecal Reserve Bank. The delegation of authority and other procedures set forth above shall be effec tive only during such period or periods as there are available less than a total of seven regular members and regular alternates of the Federal Open Market Committee. As used herein the term \"regular member\" refers to a member of the Federal Open Market Committee duly appointed or elected in accorcance with existing law; the term \"regular alternate\" refers to an alternate of the Committee duly elected in accordance with existing law and serving in the absence of the regular member for whom he was elected; and the term \"alternate at large\" refers to any other duly elected alternate of the Committee at a time when the member in whose absence he was elected to serve is available. The following resolution authorizing certain actions by the Federal Reserve Banks during an emergency was reaffirmed by unanimous vote: The Federal Open Market Committee hereby authorizes each Federal Reserve Bank to take any or all of the actions set forth below during war or defense emergency when such Federal Reserve Bank finds itself unable after reasonable efforts to be in communication with the Federal Open Market Committee (or with the Interim Committee acting in lieu of the Federal Open Market Committee) or when the Federal Open Market Committee (or such Interim Committee) is unable to function. 3/3/64 -36 (1) Whenever it deems it necessary in the light of economic conditions and the general credit situation then prevailing (after taking into account: the possibility of providing necessary credit through advances secured by direct obligations of the United States under the last paragraph of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act), such Federal Reserve Bank may purchase and sell obligations of the United States for its own account, either outright or under re purchase agreement, from and to banks, dealers, or other holders of such obligations. (2) In case any prospective seller of obligations of the United States to a Federal Reserve Bank is unable to tender the actual securities representing such obligations because of conditios resulting from the emergency, such Federal Reserve Bank may, in its discretion and subject to such safeguards as it deems necessary, accept from such seller, in lieu of the actual securities, a \"due bill\" executed by the seller in form acceptable to such Federal Reserve Bank stating in substantial effect that the seller is the owner of the obligations which are the subject of the purchase, that ownership of such obligations is thereby transferred to the Federal Reserve Bank, and that the obligations themselves will be delivered to the Federal Reserve Bank as soon as possible. (3) Such Federal Reserve Bank may in its discretion purchase special certificates of indebtedness directly from the United States in such amounts as may be needed to cover overdrafts in the general account of the Treasurer of the United States on the books of such Bank or for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, but such Bank shall take all steps practicable at the time to insure as far as possible that the amount of obligations acquired directly from the United States and held by it, together with the amount of such obligations so acquired and held by all other Federal Reserve Banks, does not exceed $5 billion at any one time. Auttority to take the actions above set forth shall be effective only until such time as the Federal Reserve Bank is able again to establish communications with the Federal Open Market Committee (or the Interim Committee), and such Committee is then functioning. By unanimous vote the Committee reaffirmed the authorization, first given at the meeting on December 16, 1958, providing for System personnel assigned to the Office of Emergency Planning, Special Facilities Branch (formerly, Office of Civil and Defense 3/3/64 -37 Mobilization--Classif.ed Location) on a rotating basis to have access to the resolutions (1) providing for continued operation of the Committee during an emergency and (2) authorizing certain actions by the Federal Reserve Banks during an emergency. There was unanimous agreement that no action should be taken to change the existing procedure, as called for by resolution adopted June 21, 1939, requesting the Board of Governors to cause its examining force to furnish the Secretary of the Federal Open Market Committee a report of each exam ination of the System Open Market Account. Reference was made to the procedure authorized at the meeting of the Commrittee on March 2, 1955, and most recently reaffirmed on March 5, 1963, whereby, in addition to members and officers of the Committee and Reserve Bank Presidents not currently members of the Committee, minutes and other records could be made available to any other employee of the Board of Governors or of a Federal Reserve Bank with the approval of a member of the Committee or another Reserve Bank President, with notice to the Secretary. It was stated that lists of currently authorized persons at the Board and at each Federal Reserve Bank (excluding secretaries and records and duplicating personnel) had recently been confirmed by the Secretary of the Committee. The current lists were reported to be in the custody of the Secretary, and it was noted that revisions could be sent to the Secretary at any time. 3/3/64 -38 It was agreed unanimously that no action should be taken at this time to amend the procedure authorized on March 2, 1955. This concluded the consideration of the continuing authorizations of the Open Market Committee, and the Committee turned to a review of operations during the period since the meeting of the Committee on February 11, 1964. Before this meeting there had been distributed to the members of the Committee a report from the Special Manager of the System Open Market Account on foreign exchange market conditions and on Open Market Account and Treasury operations in foreign currencies for the period February 11 through February 26, 1964, and a supplementary report covering the period February 27 through March 2, 1964. Copies of these reports have been placed in the files of the Committee. Supplementing the written reports, Mr. Coombs commented that the gold stock would remain unchanged this week. As of today, he said, the Stabilization Fund had on hand $74 million of gold, including $18 million received in the February distribution of the Gold Pool. Sales of at least $53 million during March were expected. The Russians were still on the sidelines of the London market. There had been a great deal of activity in the exchange markets during the past three weeks, Mr. Coombs said, with ominous speculative tendencies developing in the markets for both sterling and the German mark. In the case of sterling, publication of some disappointing trade 3/3/64 -39 figures for January triggered a strong burst of speculation against sterling begirning about 10 days before the British Bank rate increase and the Bank of England was forced to disburse at least $85 million in intervention operations. While various statements by British official spokesmen explaining the Bank rate increase had stressed the overheating of the domestic economy, Mr. Coombs felt sure they were equally concerned with the drain on their reserve position. In 1961, when a similar speculative drive on sterling developed in March of that year, the British delayed action until August and, in the meanwhile, lost more than $1 billion. On this occasion, the swift and decisive response of the Bank of England in the form of a 1 per cent Bank rate increase had thrown back the speculative drive before it could gather momentum. Since last Friday, Mr. Coombs said, the Bank of England had recovered nearly half of its previous reserve losses and the sterling rate had moved back up from a low of 2.7945 to approximately 2.7980. On balance, British reserves decreased nearly $48 million in February. Short covering seemed to be the major factor in the rise in the sterling rate with no irdication as yet of any movement of short-term investment money from New York to London. Since last Thursday, the covered interest arbitrage differential had been close to zero and this might partly reflect market knowledge both in London and New York that the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve were in a position to squeeze out quickly any sizable differential which might appear. 3/3/64 -40- The counterpart of the speculative attack on sterling, Mr. Coombs continued, was the development of strong buying pressure on the German mark as rumors of a possible revaluation began to flood the market. During the first three weeks of February the Bundesbank took in more than $200 million. During this period, Mr. Coombs said, he had repeatedly suggested to Bundesbank officials the desirability of a resumption of forward operations in order to reassure the market that the mark parity would remain unchanged. Possibly because these Bundesbank officials were not themselves fully persuaded of their government\\'s firmness on this matter, they suggested waiting a while longer. The British Bank rate decision might have helped to stiffen the Bundesbank\\'s position, however, and they concurred last Thursday in a resumption of Federal Reserve spot operations financed by a swap drawing, and, on Friday, in a resumption of forward operations for joint Treasury and Bundesbank account. So far, these operations on both the spot and forward markets seemed to have had some useful results not only in strengthening the dollar rate against the mark but, much more importantly, in providing the market with official reassurances that the mark parity would not be changed. Sales of $7.5 million equivalent of forward marks had brought the forward premium on the mark down to about 0.66 per cent today from 1.05 per cent when the operation was begun, and the whole market had a much better tone. It was expected that these operations would be further reinforced next week, when the Bundesbank would offer forward cover at 3/3/64 -41 a cost of 1/2 per cent to German commercial banks placing funds in U. S. Treasury bills. The technical effect of this operation would be to shift dollars from the Bundesbank to the commercial banks, but the willingness of the Bundesbank to assume a short position in marks by thus providing forward cover should help still further to reassure the market that the mark parity would remain unchanged. The lira continued under pressure, Mr. Coombs said, and the Bank of Italy would show a sizable reserve loss for February. The Italian Government had not yet put together a comprehensive balance of payments program although the Bank of Italy had unobtrusively brought about a considerable measure of credit restraint, and, last month, the Government took several tax measures designed to curtail luxury imports and to strengthen confidence in the security markets. Mr. Coombs reported that on March 9 the Treasury, in order to pay off a maturing lire bond, would take over $50 million of the lire that the Account had sold forward to the Treasury. In the Netherlands, he observed, the guilder had continued to weaken and last week the System was able to purchase for Treasury account $17 million of guilders. These guilders would be used to reverse an earlier Treasury swap of marks against guilders and provided, Mr. Coombs thought, another good illustration of the usefulness of the technique of moving through swaps from one European currency to another. 3/3/64 -42 The Swiss franc also showed a weakening tendency, Mr. Coombs reported, partly because of seasonal influerces and partly because of the deterioration of the Swiss balance of payments position. The dollar holdings of the Swiss National Bank had now become reduced to their normal level of $175 million and this would mean that any net demand for dollars in Switzerland would now give the System an opportunity to sell dollars for Swiss francs. Mr. Coombs was hopeful of making rapid progress in reducing the System\\'s Swiss franc debt over the next few months. Mr. Wayne asked what the source was of the gold that the London Pool had distributed in February, and Mr. Coombs replied that he was not entirely sure. He thought there had been some weakening of speculation in gold, and he was hopeful that if there were continued improvement in the U. S balance of payments this tendency toward dishoarding would be reinforced. Also, the South Africans were not doing quite as well as earlier, and they were supplying a larger proportion of their gold output to the ma ket. In answer to a question by Mr. Daane, Mr. Coombs said that British reserves had increased $28 million immediately after the change in the Bank rate, and there had been some further accruals since. The situation was not yet solid. Their bill rate was left at a very low level in relation to the Bank rate when the latter was raised. If sterling showed any weakening tendencies, the authorities might have to move the bill rate up a bit more. 3/3/64 -43 Mr. Ellis referred to Mr. Coombs\\' ccmment that the Bank of England and. the System were in a position to squeeze out any sizable covered interest differential between New York and London, and asked Mr. Coombs what his expectations were with respect to the differential. Mr. Coombs replied that he would no: want to see a differential develop of more than 25 basis points in favor of London, and would plan to operate in the spot and forward markets to prevent it. With a larger covered spread there was a risk that funds would flow out. He noted that the same situation existed with respect to the spread between New York and Montreal; it had not exceeded 25 basis points in recent months. In reply to further questions, Mr. Coombs said he had not heard reports of funds moving abroad on an uncovered basis. The main short run effect of the increase in British interest rates, he thought, was to make the London market a more expensive source of financing, and to lead to a tendency for borrowers to seek furds in the Euro-dollar market or in New Yo-k. There already were indications that Euro-dollar rates were moving up and this possibly would go further. Thereupon, upon motion culy made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the System Open Market Account trans actions in foreign currencies during the period February 11 through March 2, 1964, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. 3/3/64 -44 Mr. Coombs recommended renewal of the standby swap arrangement of $100 million with the Netherlands Bank for a further three-month period, and renewal for another three months of a $13 million swap with the Bank for International Settlements of sterling against Swiss francs. Renewals for further three-month periods of the standby swap arrangement of $100 million with the Netherlands Bank, and of a $13 million swap with the Bank for International Settlements of sterling against Swiss francs, as recommended by Mr. Coombs, were approved. Before this meeting there had been distributed to the members of the Committee a report from the Manager of the System Open Market Account covering open market operations in U. S. Government securities and bankers\\' acceptances for the period February 11 through February 26, 1964, and a supplemental report covering the period February 27 through March 2, 1964. Copies of both reports have been placed in the files of the Committee. In supplementation of the written reports, Mr. Stone commented as follows: The prices of Government securities have drifted irregularly lower since the last meeting of the Committee, largely in adjustment, first, to discussion of the possibility of a rise in the British Bank rate, and then to the 1 per cent increase in that rate on February 27. The market\\'s reaction to the actual increase in the Bank rate was notably mild, with prices declining generally 6/32 to 8/32 before the week end and then recovering 1/32 to 2/32 yesterday. The moderate nature of the adjustment thus far undoubtedly reflects the extent to which the market had already had an opportunity to weigh the implications of a move by the British 3/3/64 -45- for the future course of domestic interest rates. There was no precipitate break in prices such as might have occurred had the rate change caught the markets unaware. By the time the change occurred, the market was in a reasonably good technical position, with dealer holdings of issues maturing in over five years down to $93 million from $280 million at the time of the Committee\\'s last meeting. Dealer\\'s net positions in such issues receded further to $16 million at Friday night\\'s close as a result both of purchases for Treasury investment accounts and some small investment buying. The market at the present time is waiting and watching cau tiously to see how the passage of the tax bill and the change in the Bank rate affect the course of the American economy and the pattern of international money flows over the weeks and months ahead. Treasury bill rates also moved higher over the period since the last meeting in response to the same factors affecting the market for coupon securities. In yesterday\\'s weekly auction a strong demand developed for Treasury bills at the higher levels to which rates had risen after the Bank rate change. While market discussion before the auction had pointed to rates of 3.60-3.62 per cent on the three-mcnth bill and 3.80-3.81 per cent on the six-month bill, the average issuing rates actually established were about 3.59 and 3.78 per cent, respectively. Prices of outstanding corporate and municipal bonds reached their highest levels of the year at about the time of the Committee\\'s last meeting and then declined irregularly in response to an increased supply of new offerings as well as to the uncertainties stemming from the factors affecting the Government securities market. Offering rates on new issues coming to the market worked irregularly higher over the interval as investors resisted the efforts of underwriters to lead the market toward lower yields. Looking ahead, the calendar of municipal offerings remains near recent high levels while activity in the corporate market is dominated by the offering by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company of rights to subscribe to about $1.2 billion of additional stock. Turning to open market operations, the System conducted operations in the market on only two days during the first two weeks of the period. Since last Wednesday, however, the System has bought about $650 million Treasury bills, almost all in the market, as market factors have absorbed reserves more rapidly than had been estimated on the basis of past behavior. 3/3/64 -46 Mr. Deming asked whether Mr. Stone would associate a present bill rate of about 3.60 per cent with approximately the same market conditions as obtained three weeks ago, when the bill rate was at 3.53 per cent. In other words, would a higher level of reserve availability be required now than three weeks ago to reduce the bill rate to its earlier level? Mr. Stone replied that for the immediate future there probably would be sufficient uncertainty in the market to require greater reserve availability than formerly to reduce the bill rate to about 3.53 per cent. But after perhaps another ten days or two weeks the market would have formed a consensus, and if that consensus was that there would be no immediate policy response to the increase, in the British Bank rate and the tax cut, the bill rate probably would settle back to its previous neighborhood. Mr. Mills said that he did not know how it could have been avoided, but last Wednesday the Account had purchased about $200 million in bills on the last day of a reserve week vhen there were indications that reserves were needed. But previously the Account had operated on a line that yielded free reserves somewhat below $100 million. The $200 million purchase raised the average level of free reserves above $100 million but did not affect the tone of the market, which tone was exhibited in the Federal funds rate and the Treasury bill rate. What concerned him, Mr. Mills said, was the unintentional element of dissimulation in raising 3/3/64 -47 free reserve averages for the week in statistical terms but not changing the underlying market conditions. Mr. Stone said the operation last Wednesday was undertaken primarily to offset what had seemed to the Management to be a sharp tightening of market conditions. Daily figures on member bank borrowing through Tuesday clearly indicated that the market was in process of developing substantial pressure. On Friday, February 21, borrowings were $74 million; on Monday, $244 million; and on Tuesday, $313 million. The performance of the market on Wednesday suggested that these pressures were not only continuing but intensifying, and in the light of the signals coming from the market, the Desk bought $212 million of bills on Wednesday. Member bank borrowings on that day were $57,+ million. When he saw that figure the next morning, Mr. Stone said, it seemed to him that the Desk\\'s reading of the market had been right. Had the Wednesday purchases not been made, borrowings could have risen to close to $1 billion that day. In reply to questions by Mr. Ellis, Mr. Stone reported that the Treasury anticipated announcing a cash fina:cing of about $1-1/2 billion sometime during the last full week of March, with payment in the early part of April. The next major financing would be the May refunding, which the Treasury would discuss with its advisory committees during the last week in April. If the cash financing involved fairly short-term securities with a payment date around April 8, the securities probably would be fairly well digested by the payment date. The Committee would 3/3/64 -48- then have a \"free period\" of about three weeks before the May refunding. If the cash financing involved longer term bonds, the free period would be reduced. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities and bankers\\' acceptances during the period February 11 through March 2, 1964, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. Chairman Martin then called for the staff economic and financial reports, supplementing the written reports that had been distributed prior to the meeting, copies of which have been placed in the files of the Committee. Mr. Koch commented on economic conditions as follows: The two major domestic economic considerations most relevant to the determination of monetary policy are: (1) the existing degree of resource utilization, and (2) the balance and sustainability of recent developments. What are the new facts available relating to these considerations, particularly as to their implications for the future? As for resource utilization, the unemployment rate in February was probably little changed from January\\'s 5.6 per cent. Thus, it remained in the narrow 5-1/2 to 6 per cent range in which it has fluctuated now for two years. The rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity is estimated to still be at 87 per cent, a level which it reached in the second quarter of 1963 and at which it remained for the rest of the year. For major materials, which have more to do with the beginnings of inflation than manufacturing as a whole, the utilization rate is estimated at 82 per cent. In the past, upward price and cost pressures have tended to develop when major materials output approached 90 per cent of capacity. Now that the tax cut is a reality, utilization of both labor and capital will no doubt increase over the coming months, but the rise is likely to be gradual and to take place only after some time lag. Turning to the character of recent economic developments, let me comment briefly now on four strategic areas, namely, 3/3/64 -49 inventories, fixed investment, prices, and wages. Manufacturing inventories decreased moderately in January, after showing a fairly large increase in the fourth quarter. Average stock/sales ratios, which had been running at historically low levels, actually took an appreciable dip in December and January when factory shipments rose substantially after showing Little change for some months. Recent inventory developments suggest that business manage- ment is still apparently more interested in economizing on stocks rather than in hedging future price increases. One evidence of this is that stocks of finished goods have been rising, while stocks of raw materials have been declining. Moreover, most purchasing agents report their inventory holdings as at about desired levels, and they indicate little change in future buying commitments. As for fixed investment, new orders for durable goods picked up sharply in January following two months of decline. The January rise was due mainly to heavier ordering of steel, aircraft, and missiles. This pickup may also have been partly a seasonal development, since the seasonally adjusted series on orders also jumped sharply in January of the two preceding years. New orders for durable goods have shown sharp fluctuations around a fairly stable level since early last year, with the fluctuations due mainly to variations in steel and defense ordering. However, over this period new orders for producers\\' equipment have shown a fairly ;teady and large rise. In January, with total new orders up 5 per cent from a year earlier, new orders for nonelectrical machinery were up 13 per cent. According to a recent NICB survey, new capital appropriations of large manufacturing companies, which generally precede spending by from 6 to 9 months, declined 13 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1963. This decline followed sharp increases in the two preced ing quarters. In the past, periods of sharp increase have typically been followed by brief declines. These new orders and capital appropriations data can still be considered consistent with the conclusion of the recent McGraw-Hill resurvey, namely, that businessmen are showing quiet confidence in their fixed investment spending programs rather than a boom psychology. Lionel D. Edie & Co. estimates a 12 per cent rise in business fixed capital outlays this year, asagainst the McGraw-Hill 9 per cent, but this, too, does not add up to a capital spending boom. Price developments continue to raise gnawing concern about their possible cumulative potentialities. Dramatic developments are centered in nonferrous metals. Tim prices first rose sharply 3/3/64 -50- and then fell back when sales from the Government\\'s stockpile were stepped up. Copper is up in price in speculative markets and being rationed. Major producers of zinc failed to go along with an attempted price increase, although demand has been strong. There is some hope that price increases in the nonferrous metals area will be limited by the increases in production that are being stimulated. Recent price developments in the nonferrous metals area raise the question of import quotas that remain in effect for lead and zinc, and Government stockpiles which continue high in the case of most metals. If the price rise continues and remains of particular concern in the nonferrous metals area, specific Government action regarding import quotas and stockpiles would appear more desirable alternatives than general measures to restrain over-all demand. The most significant wage settlement thus far this year las been in the trucking industry where a 38 month contract has been signed involving a total wage increase, including fringe benefits, amounting to an annual rate of a little under 4 per cent. In general, moreover, wage increases received by the Teamsters in recent years have been somewhat larger than those in most other industries. This recent settlement in trucking, along with those in glass and apparel, are roughly comparable in amount to the average reached in last year\\'s negotiations. More generally, with labor productivity continuing to rise, wage rate increases equal to those of recent years would result in further stability of unit labor costs. Bargaining in nonferrous metals, autos, farm equipment, and meat packing is still to come. Auto bargain ing, in particular, could either confirm or upset the recent stability in labor costs. Recent comments by Walter Reuther and George Meany suggest a further f:rming of bargaining positions and a disinclination to pay much attention to the wage/price guidelines proposed by the Administration. Recent management comment on the guidelines also has been critical. But all this may be bargaining tactics, and when the participants in the auto industry sit down at the bargaining table, reason is still likely to prevail. The adversaries are strong, sophisticated, and well-informed, and have done business with each other before. To sum up my reading of the domestic economic information recently becoming available to us, it suggests continuing ample availability of labor and plant capacity, stability in labor costs and in the general price level, and still little evidence of imbalances or excesses developing in key areas of activity. From the point of view of the available evidence on domestic economic developments and despite the tax cut, no change in monetary policy is called for at this time. 3/3/64 -51- Mr. Noyes made the following statement concerning monetary and credit developments: Preliminary figures for the last half of February suggest that the conventionally defined money supply drifted down a little further from the early January high. Over the same period, time deposits at commercial banks have moved erratically- most recently up again--as the changes have been dominated by the aggressiveness with which banks have marketed negotiable C.D.\\'s. Passbook savings have tended to rise somewhat less vigorously since the turn of the year. After a small seasonally adjusted decline in January, bank cred.t expansion appears to have picked up again in February. This was due in part to the fact that bank holdings of Governments, which usually decline, remained substantially unchanged, while bank investment in municipal and agency issues increased a little. Among the loan categories, business loans picked up as compared to January, but are still well below the rate of expansion that prevailed in the last half of 1963. Real estate and consumer loans also rose somewhat and security loans showed less than the normal seasonal decline. All of the measures of aggregate reserves--total nonborrowed, total required, and required reserves behind private deposits- have drifted down since early January. Free reserves have fluctuated rather widely, both from week to week and as between the preliminary and final figures. The tone in the money market remained steady, however, up to the announcement of the Bank rate change Thursday. After the announcement, 90-day bill rates moved up to 3.60 but the general tone of te money market did not change dramatically. The tone was maintained with System purchases Thursday, Friday and yesterday that were no larger than were needed to meet seasonal reserve needs, and, in fact, the current outlook is for a somewhat lower free reserve figure this week than last. The projections suggest that the System will have to make further purchases to offset market factors next week, and in subsequent weeks through early April, except perhaps for the week ending March 18. So far, at least, it does not appear that market developments since the Bank rate increase are in any sense forcing the System\\'s hand in the direction of a particular policy change. In other words, there is not, at present, a situation in the market which would in itself dictate either a change in open market policy or in discount rates. 3/3/64 -52- Apart from any change in policy, both the staff and some Committee members have felt concern recently with regard to the present wording of the economic directive. The first paragraph of the directive is in obvious need of revision at this meeting to take account of new information on economic and financial developments. But the concern to which L refer relates more specificially to the second or operational paragraph. It runs in part to the implications of continuing for too long a period a primary target expressed in terms of the \"maintenance of the same money market conditions,\" and in part to the problems associated with the actual or potential conflict between such a target and \"accommodating moderate expansion in aggregate bank reserves.\" There are certainly times when the words \"maintain the same conditions in the money market\" express the desires of the Committee as well or better than any other words that might be chosen. But perhaps the dangers involved in a continued use of such a phrase are best illustrated by the fact that it has not seemed appropriate to change it as we move into and out of periods in which an \"even keel\" is dictated by Treasury financing operations. Thus, the record could be read to suggest that the Manager has been directed to maintain on \"even keel\" continuously since early last fall--and the behavior of the market might be inter preted to suggest that he has been reasonably successful in carrying out just such a directive. Yet it seems doubtful that any member of the Committee who has voted to approve the directive would wish to have his position interpreted in this way. From this, I conclude that the phrase \"maintain about the same money market conditions\" should, if possible, be reserved for those occasions when it is literally the Committee\\'s intention, which would be during periods of Treasury financing and perhaps a few others, and that other words should be employed to direct the continuation of about the same policy from meeting to meeting. Let me comment briefly on the conflict aspect of the directive. I think everyone who has been exposed to the working of the Committee has had a try at revising the directive so as to maintain short-run instructions, such as a bill rate, market tone, or free reserve target on the one hand, and at the same time give recognition to a medium-term goal of appropriate change in one or another of the total reserve measures. Despite the remarks of ill-informed critics, there is no doubt whatever in my mind that the people in this room are as aware as anyone of the relationship between money market conditions and aggregate bank reserve expansion or contraction. It is not ignorance or humility but wisdom which has caused them to avoid 3/3/64 locking policy to prescribed rate of growth in one or another of the total reserve measures. Yet, the same wisdom leads them to acknowledge the fact that any given policy posture toward market conditions has implications for the rate of total reserve expansion, difficult as it may be to quantify that relationship for a short period. As I have indicated, I do not believe it is presently feasible to cast a meaningful current operational directive primarily in terms of a rate of growth in some aggregate reserve measure. What is possible is to state the desired policy in terms of a market target or targets, cast in terms of rates, tone and feel, or free reserves, which may be as specific or as broad as the Committee wishes, and then express the expected implications of such a policy for aggregate reserve expansion in the light of anticipated external mar.et conditions. The first two alternative drafts prepared by the staff for your consideration later in the meeting recast the direc.ive along these lines. Mr. Furth commented on the balance of payments as follows: Preliminary payments data for the first two months of the year have been surprisingly favorable. The payments deficit for January amounted to $143 million, and the tentative weekly data for February suggest a deficit of only $40 million, after deducting from U. S. receipts $80 million of German military prepayments, If final data confirm these figures, the payments deficit for the first two months would be at an annual rate of only $1.1 billion, as compared with a rate of $1.5 billion in the second half of 1963. The recent figures are particularly satisfying for three reasons. First, foreign private dollar holdings rose in January by .400 million, offsetting the decline in those holdings during December. Hence, on the basis of \"official settlements\" January would have shown a substantial surplus rather than a deficit. Second, U. S. bank-reported claims on foreigners rose in January more than $200 million; even if only short-term U. S. claims are taken into consideration, the U. S. liquidity position would on balance show some improvement rather than deterioration. On the basis of the tentative February data, it seems that in February, too, \"official settlements\" yielded a U. S. surplus, and the rise in U. S. bank-reported claims on foreigners exceeded the amount of the conventional deficit. Finally, the U. S. trade balance appears to continue to improve. Export figures for January are not yet available but imports reveal welcome stability. And two factors should contribute to the maintenance of our export volume in the current quarter. One is 3/3/64 -54- the beginning of U. S. grain shipments to Russia. The other is the improvement in the aggregate payments position of the less developed countries, which should induce these countries to increase their imports, including imports from the United States. Whether or not the favorable paymer ts trend can be expected to continue in the longer run, however, will largely depend on the effects of the recent tax cut and on the course of monetary policies in foreign developed countries. The tax cut will presumably raise U. S. imports--I understand that a rise at an annual rate of $1 billion is expected for the rest of this year--but it should also keep capital outflows down, even in the absence of significant changes in U. S. interest-rate levels. First, the increased government deficit will absorb a larger amount of loanable funds. Second, the expected rise in consumption will sooner or later induce an increase in business investment and therefore also lead to an increased absorption of investible funds. And third, the expected rise in economic activity should attract foreign investors. The resulting reduction in the net outflow of capital might well be more than sufficient to offset the effects not only of the rise in imports but also of an increase in foreign bond flotations in New York which may follow the enactment of the irterest equalization tax. Incidentally, the civil rights filibuster in the Senate will presumably further delay enactment of the IET and thereby prolong the favorable effect of the prevailing uncertainty on the U. S. payments balance. The main threat to continued favorable developments in U. S. international payments is posed by the possibility of larger outflows of volatile funds in response to actions of European authorities. The recent increase in the British Bank rate was clearly de:ensive; nevertheless, a fall in the forward sterling discount could make the covered differertial between London and New York large enough to attract a substantial volume of funds from the United States, especially into British hire-purchase paper. And there remains the risk of further restrictive measures in Britain or on the Continent. The British domestic and international position as such should not warrant anxiety about further basic deterioration which might force Britain to take more drastic action. Temporary outflows of funds from Britain in response to election uncertain ties and similar random factors could easily be offset by British drawings on the IMF or on existing bilateral arrangements, including the Federal Reserve swaps. On the Continent, most countries enjoy not only full employment but, except for Italy, France, and Germany, also reasonable payments equilibrium. 3/3/64 -55 In Italy, further moderate corrective measures, preferably in the field of fiscal policy, may suffce to stop the infla tionary spiral and reduce the payments deficit without inducing disruptively large international flows of capital or putting an end to Italy\\'s domestic expansion. The French payments surplus is definitely declining; recent French accumulations of dollars have been insignificant, a change gratifying as much for its political as its purely financial connotations. But the German surplus, far from declining, appears to be rising as fast as, or faster than., the combined surplus of the rest of Europe is shrinking. In view of the combination of domestic full employment and external surplus, simple traditional expansionary or restrictive policies would obviously be as inappropriate in Germany as they are in the opposite case of the United States. The Germans are unwilling to reduce the competitive advantage of their export industries, either by letting wages and prices gradually creep up, or by undertaking another revaluation of the mark. But if they find it impractical to apply new fiscal measures of the kind proposed for dealing with situations like theirs, the payments surplus will inevitably not only accelerate their domestic monetary expansion but also put increased pressure on exchange rates. This pressure would hit first the weaker currencies such as sterling but eventually also the stronger currencies, including the dollar. This problem may well turn out to be the touchstone for the ability of the present payments mechanism to maintain international equilibrium under fixed exchange rates together with adequate economic growth with the help of mutual consultation and cooperation. Chairman Martin invited Mr. Young to comment on the recent neeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development he had attended. Mr. Young made the following comments: From the latest discussions in OECD meetings in Paris--namely, of its Economic Policy Committee and Working Party 3 groups--one carried away the impression that Europe no longer worries much about the U. S. payments deficit and its potential threat to the dollar, but is now mainly preoccupied with European inflationary pressures already generated or threatening to be generated by the cumulative payments surpluses or their aftermath. Indeed, one came away with the distinct feeling that 1964 is likely to be a swing year in international payments, with the U. S. deficit and the over-all European surplus against the rest of the world both much 3/3/64 -56- reduced, but with varying degrees of developing imbalance among European countries. The outlook for European balances of payments in 1964 was reported in these discussions about as tollows: U. K. - Expecting a small surplus on current account, but a small-to-moderate over-all deficit because of capital outflow. France - Expecting a swing from a payments surplus exceeding $1 billion to balance or possibly to a small over-all deficit. Italy - Expecting a continued over-all deficit of roughly the same magnitude as in 1963--about $1-1/4 billion. Germany - Expecting a sharp increase in over-all surplus, ir all likelihood exceeding $2 billion and stemming from both export trade and capital inflow developments. Netherlands - Expecting a swing from a payments surplus in 1963 of around $100 million to a deficit in 1964 in the neighborhood of $275 million. Belgium - Expecting about balance. Switzerland - Expecting some worsening of current account deficit plus a much smaller capital inflow; hence, a smaller over-all surplus. Scandinavian countries - Expecting payments to balance roughly. These expectations do not add up. If European countries other than Germany are either in near balance or have substantial deficits, and only Germany has a large surplus, then the rest of the world should be at least in balance if not in moderate surplus. But all non-European industrial countries and Canada expect a deficit. This leaves the less developed countries as the main surplus areas, which seems unlikely. Apparently economic fore sight in the balance of payments sector is little better than i. other sectors of the economy. Comment in the meetings fccused especially on Germany and Italy. German representatives asserted that the Federal Government was sifting all possibilities for action to bring down her payments surplus. It had considered and renounced revaluation as a solution. But, as possibilities, it was still considering some kind of uni lateral tariff action for non-EEC countries; possible enactment of an interest withholding tax applicable to foreign investors or even of a nondiscriminatory withholding tax; and finally, with a view to stimulating capital exports, elimination of the capital issues tax of 2-1/2 per cent. And, of course, it was emphasized that there were serious obstacles to each of these courses of action. 3/3/64 -57- The official German view was that there was little that monetary policy could do under the circumstances of large payments surplus except to let that surplus have its monetary expansion effects. And so the posture of the Bundesbank would be passive or neutral, even though the monetary effects internally could be strongly inflationary in direction. Operations to lower the long-term interest rate could not help much, because non interest motivations were playing such a large role in the capital inflow. The Italian report was an explanation in depth of the additional stabilization measures taken last weekend. As you know, these included a strengthening of tax collection processes; a curb on consumption expenditures on durable goods, with the hope of some redirect:on of output of these goods to export markets; regulation of key food and pharmaceutical prices; the diversion of additional revenues to the financing of essential public investment expend itures; and institution of a policy of wages-productivity guidelines. The earlier stabilization steps had had the objective of stopping expansion of government expenditures; relieving demand pressures on the construction industry; and setting in motion Bank of Italy curbs on bank credit and monetary expansion. The target for this latter cutback had now been set at 12 per cent, down from a 20 per cent rate of increase in 1963, to be achieved as rapidly as possible, but not so rapidly as to risk a deflationary upset. Whether the Italian stabilization program is adequate to cope with swelling inflationary movement was doubted by a number of European participants in the discussion, but it was generally agreed that it was taking a desirable shape and, that, in its present form, it represented much hard decision-taking by the new coalition government. The report by the Dutch representative was noteworthy mainly for its frankness in admitting a real breakdown in Dutch stabilization efforts as a result of repressed wage pressures. For an interim period, it was admitted the Netherlands\\' economy had to go through still more inflationary wage and price adjustment--something above 7 per cent each year. In this process, rising interest rates, both short- and long-term, were to be expected in the months ahead. The reports of French and Swiss representatives were accounts of their respective anti-inflation efforts, but for neither country did the representatives claim that full containment of inflationary pressures was foreseen for the near-term future. On the contrary, the implication in both cases was that inflationary trends internally were likely to continue, though hopefully a stage of stability might be reached late in 1964. The Swiss, of course, renounced both revaluation of the franc and rising domestic interest rates as alternatives of a national policy. 3/3/64 -58 In conclusion, I should comment briefly on the report of the U. K. representatives. On the whole, their diagnosis of internal and external developments was on the gratified and optimistic side. The only indications of possible early restrictive Bank rate action were incidental references to the recent increases in wage rates in excess of productivity gains, the recent rise in imports and in prices of some important export lines, and some contra-seasonal weakness in sterling, but these were only indications in hindsight. Otherwise, their report exuded confidence that economic trends would work out reasonably satisfactorily for the U. K., with the year 1964 one of impressive gains domestically and of no unmanageale deterioration externally. Mr. Daane reported that he had attended a meeting of the deputies of the Group of 10 on February 27 and 28, at which they had completed the exploratory phase of their study. They were now heading for the negotiation phase. The first day of the meeting was rather chaotic, but the second day was better and there were grounds for hoping that something useful would be accomplished by the study. The effort of some countries to lire up a European front against the U. S. and in favor of proposals to supplant partially or totally the reserve currency system was not successful. It did not appear that anything immediately affecting the System would come out of this study except in the broader sense. As to the meeting itself, he thought it significant that there was an improvement in atmosphere as the meeting went along from the standpoint of sympathy with the U. S. point of view. There had been a full discussion on the subject of IMF quotas with a wide range of views expressed, variously favoring no increase in quotas, a general increase, and selective increases. Under Secretary Roosa took a stance favorable to a general increase in quotas. Dr. Emminger of the 3/3/64 ..59- Bundesbank gave an able summary of the main proposals for improving international liquidity, such as the Triffin, Paathuma, and Stamp plans, that had originated outside the group, It was possible that the text of his paper might be available for study at some point. Chairman Martin then called for the usual go-around of comments and views on economic conditions and monetary policy beginning with Mr. Hayes, who commented as follows: Two major events have occurred since our last meeting which may ultimately have an important bearing on our policies but which at the moment are almost impossible to evaluate. I have in mind the long-awaited enactment of the tax reduction bill last Wednesday and the increase in the British Bank rate from 4 to 5 per cent last Thursday. I should like to consider with you some of the possible repercussions of these actions in the light of the general economic and financial background. The jusiness situation is still basically favorable. Business sentiment continues to be stronger than a year ago and appears to have avoided the usual inter doldrums. Although a number of statistical series weakened in January, such-leading indicators as housing starts and new orders for durables rose substantially. Consumer buying plans remain well above the level of a year ago and expectations of a sizable expansion ir business spending in 1964 have received further confirmation. In contrast with many periods in recent years, the uncertainties in the current outlook relate largely not to whether business will be advancing in the coming months, but to the pace of the advance. There seems to be some evidence that the rate of increase in wholesale industrial prices has slackened off in the last few weeks. Thus we may have some respite, in the immediate future, with respect to our worries over possible revival of inflationary pressures; but for the longer pull we must remain very much on our guard, especially in view of the important wage negotiations this summer and the uncertain impact of the tax cut. The unemployment situation remains virtually the same as it has been for many months. Widely divergent views may be found on the probable timing and strength of the tax cut\\'s stimulating influence on the economy. It seems to me that perhaps too little attention has been paid to the problem of under-withholding resulting from the very sharp 3/3/64 -60- drop in the withholding rate. This means that the direct stimulus to consumer spending may be concentrated in 1964 even more than the distribution of the reduction in personal tax liabilities between the years 1964 and 1965 would suggest. On the other hand, it probably remains true, as both the C.E.A. and Secretary Dillon have emphasized, that the greatest over-all impact will be felt in 1965 because of the natural lag in secondary effects. It seems probable that, on balance, the tax cut will have sizable beneficial impact both on consumer spending and on business investment. On the Federal expenditure side it is by no means clear how soon the rather drastic control of expenditures will \"take hold\" and how the timing of such effects will mesh with the tax effects already discussed. The latest balance of payments statistics are rather encouraging. The January deficit was relatively small after allowing for special factors, and this appears to be true also of the fragmentary February data, despite a sizable increase in United States acquisitions of Canadian and other foreign bonds. Our export and import statistics also make satisfactory reading, with the trade surplus for the fourth quarter of 1963 rising to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $6.1 billion ($6.8 billion in December). On the other hand, aggregate capital outflows continue substantial, and there is some apprehension abroad as to a possible upsurge in new foreign issues if and when the interest equalization tax is finally passed. As for the British Bank rate move, I am hopeful that this action will not trigger any competitive moves on the European Continent, although it is possible that some central bank or banks might find it necessary at some future date to tighten credit still further to deal with domestic inflationary problems. The large uncovered spread that has now opened up between British and U. S. bill rates is substantially offset by certain risk factors associated with the coming British, election. It seems to me that we can only applaud Britain\\'s determination to defend decisively the present sterling exchange rate, since any other course might well in due course have set in motion dangerous speculation against the dollar. The British move has been weathered well so far in the exchange and security markets. It would be most unwise, however, to assume that our balance of payments problems are behind us. If the recent Administration estimate of a $2 billion over-all payments deficit in 1964 is anywhere near the mark, it raises very serious questions as to how so large a figure is to be financed, coming as it does in the seventh year of heavy American deficits. Moreover, even from a short-term point of view the dollar\\'s position in the exchange markets is by no means assured just because it has survived well the first impact of the British rate action. 3/3/64 -61- For example, the Euro-dollar rate has risen significantly in the last few days, possibly reflecting a shift of borrowing from London to the Euro-dollar market for f nancing of international trade and payments. Turning to credit developments, we find a mixed picture with no clear evidence of any pronounced change in the trends observed in the past year or two. The strength in total bank credit and bank loans in the first three weeks of February must be viewed against the background of the unusually sharp fluctua tions in the various credit and loan series around the year end, and the very large declines in these series in January. We get the general impression from the New York banks that there has been no major change in the underlying trend of loan demands, which is one of continuing but gradual strengthening. As we look ahead to prospective Treasury offerings beginning around the end of March and lasting through the middle of May (except perhaps for a relatively short period in April), there might be a natural inclination to take advantage of the \"free period\" represented by the next three weeks if we see any likelihood of a need for modification of policy in the coming months. Despite this factor, however, I do not think this is a propitious time for action. With the ink scarcely dry on the tax bill, I believe we should act now only if there is a clearly demonstrable need for an immediate policy change; and that need does not exist, either on domestic or international grounds. In view of all the uncertainties I have outlined, it would seem prudent to continue our wait-and-see at:itude--recognizing that market or exchange developments may jar us out of that attitude before our next regular meeting--in which case we can deal with conditions as they arise, through a special telephone meeting if necessary. But such a problem seems a possibility rather than a probability. Clearly the discount rate should not be increased under present circumstances, and the directive should, I believe, be continued in substantially its present form, perhaps with the addition of some reference to the tax cut and the British rate action. Mr. Shuford reported that economic activity in the Eighth District had expanded moderately in recent months. Metropolitan employment rose in January and was considerably higher than in September. Spending, as reflected in department store sales and bank debits, also was higher than 3/3/64 -62 last fall. Total bank deposits had continued to increase, although business loans had declined somewhat since November. Industrial use of electric power had remained virtually unchanged since October. Farm income had continued strong through the fall of 1963, but there had been some weakening in the last few months. District livestock prices, particularly for cattle, had declined substantially. Mr. Shuford said that the sentiment of District businessmen and bankers was for continued expansion. Generally, businessmen anticipated a strong response to the tax cut, and rapid advances in investment and in personal consumption. Nationally, the economy seemed to be continuing a rather strong advance, Mr. Shuford said. While retail prices in recent months had shown some upward pressures, wholesale prices had remained stable. The balance of payments had continued to show improvement, Mr. Shuford noted, but, as discussed this morning, it was too early to appraise definitely the effect of the British Bank rate increase. The pound seemed to have strengthened as a result of the increase in rate, but it was not evident that U. S. monetary policy needed to be changed as a result. The uncertainties regarding both the balance of payments and the effects of the tax cut called for a period of watchful waiting, Mr. Shuford said, and he would favor no change in monetary policy at present. He noted that the rate of growth in the money supply had 3/3/64 -63 moderated from the 7 per cent rate that had prevailed in the latter part of 1963. Since November the rate of increase had been about 3.5 per cent, and from January to February of this year there appeared to have been some decline. In view of the expansion in the economy, of the balance of payments situation, and of recent price developments, Mr. Shuford felt that the rate of monetary expansion since November had been desirable. He believed that a rate in the 3 to 5 per cent range would be appropriate for the near future. He would favor no change in the discount rate and no change in the directive at this time. He felt as Mr. Hayes did with respect to the directive, but would be interested in seeing the drafts the staff had prepared. Mr. Bryan said that he had been reviewing figures for the Sixth District recently and had noted that in nearly every series the District had shown an excellent advance relative to a year ago, and in most cases had shown a gain relative to the nation over this period. However, in some of the figures for the last few months the position of the District seemed to show up less favorably relative to that of the nation. The District\\'s best figures continued to be in the financial area; expansion continued in bank loans and investments and in demand deposits and currency. However, there had been an increase in borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank, Although the amount of borrowing was small in comparison to the nation, it was still greater than bank reserves in the District relative to those in the nation would indicate. There were two 3/3/64 -64 unfavorable figures--the percentage of insured unemployment in the District was up sharply, and personal income for some reason was tending down. Mr. Bryan said that the policy recommendations made by Mr. Hayes and Mr. Shuford seemed to him to be essentially correct. He, too, would like to see the alternate drafts of directives prepared by the staff. Mr. Bopp observed that business conditions in the Third District appeared mediocre. At the time of the last meeting, there had been indications of greater-than-seasonal rises in unemployment in January. These had since been confirmed. Two areas had been reclassified downward, leaving the District without any \"areas of labor demand\" (areas classified \"B\" or better). In February, the situation may have improved a little. Department store sales so far in 1964 had been quite sluggish. Since the Committee\\'s last meeting, Mr. Bopp reported, moderate pressure on bank reserve positions had again become evident and business loans continued to lag relative to last year\\'s performance. Basic reserve positions of reserve city banks changed from surplus to a deficit averaging around $23 million. Reserve city banks had been modest borrowers at the discount window, adjusting their reserve positions primarily through the Federal funds market. Country banks also had been only moderte borrowers. The two key considerations for current policy were the tax cut and the increase in the British Bank rate, Mr. Bopp continued. With the 3/3/64 -65 tax cut now an accomplished fact, the question of the mix between fiscal and monetary policies became more than theoretical speculation. Had the time come to change the second ingredient of the mix by moving toward a still less easy, or actually restrictive, monetary policy? And did the development of higher rates abroad reinforce the argument for such a shift? There seemed, Mr. Bopp said, to be no question of the direction in which the tax cut and the increase in the Bank rate moved the Committee. The tax cut was certain to have some stimulating effect domestically; the Bank rate increase seemed likely to have some complicating effects on our balance of payments. The uncertainty was over degree. If one took the position that monetary ease had already bordered on the excessive, leading among other things to a deterioration in the quality of credit, these latest developments might be enough to tip the scales, despite the uncertainties involved. He had not taken that position, and so he would favor waiting for further developments. This was a period of transitior on both the domestic and inter national fronts, Mr. Bopp concluded, and until there was clear evidence that the tax cut was having inflationary effects or that events abroad were worsening the balance of payments, he would favor continuing the present degree of ease. Mr. Hickman said that with reassuring regularity the business news continued to trickle in on the up side. Housing starts were up appreciably in January. Manufacturers\\' new orders of durable goods, 3/3/64 -66 after previous declines, bounced back in January to a new record position. Retail sales in January and in early February were at approximately the same high level as December, after seasonal adjustment. A substantial gain in personal income in January was due partly, but not altogether, to such special factors as payments of dividends on veterans\\' policies and the second stage of the pay increase to Federal employees. The steel mills, Mr. Hickman reported, were extending delivery schedules and steel customers were ordering briskly so as to avoid delays. The steel industry was finding practically all of its major classes of customers in a buying mood--autos, construction, machinery, railroad equipment, and canning. As a matter of fact, it now appeared that the industry might produce as much tonnage in the first half of this year as it had during the first half of last year under the sharp spur of strike hedging. Projections for the entire year were being raised, with some figures mentioned as high as 113 million ingot tons as against 109 million tons last year. Auto output, too, had been above last year\\'s pace so far this model year. Domestic new car sales had set a record for the month for each month from October 1963 through January 1964, and possibly through February as well. Consideration in the auto industry was being given to the question as to how far the tax cut might stimulate further the already existing trend towards upgrading--that is, the increased preference for the luxury and higher-powered cars. An important background factor to be 3/3/64 -67 watched, because of its possible destabilizing effects, was the expiration of the auto-labor contracts in late summer. The generally bright business atmosphere was confirmed by devel opments in the Fourth District, Mr. Hickman continued. Steel output continued to increase, unemployment was receding almost uniformly through. out the District, and department store sales were being sustained at record levels. Loan demand at reporting barks had been exceptionally strong in the light of seasonal influences. Only two slightly off-key developments had appeared in the District: a January sag in auto sales, with the February trend not clear, and a January dip in bank debits. Both of these developments were probably associated in large part with weather conditions in the District. Altogether, balance seemed to be the outstanding feature of the business economy at the moment, Mr. Hickman said. No serious weak spots stood out except the continuing unsatisfactory status of unemployment, and a prospective moderate decline in net farm income. Nor did any industries or any particular facets of the economy show visible signs of becoming leaders in a boom. It appeared to Mr. Michman that the tone of the money market had improved since the last meeting; that is, the market had tightened somewhat. On average in the three weeks ended February 26, borrowings rose, free reserves declined, and the bill rate edged up a few basis points. He would continue to probe gently towards slightly less ease, but would try 3/3/64 -68 to avoid a sharp contraction in reserve availability that might trigger an adjustment in expectations and a discontinuous jump in money rates. He would move more vigorously only if the recent change in the British Bank rate were to disrupt the present rough balance in international capital flows. Mr. Daane said it seemed to him that the uncertainties regarding the effect of the tax cut and of the British Bank rate increase clearly dictated no change in policy during the next three weeks. He saw nothing to justify rocking the boat at present, and would not favor probing gently toward less ease in the period ahead, as Mr. Hickman had suggested. He would be inclined to take a close look at the operating implications of any change in the wording of the directive, even within the general context of no change in policy, and he probably would resist any language change that even implied gentle probing or any other change in the operational guides for the period immediately ahead. Mr. Mitchell said that he agreed with Mr. Hayes\\' analysis of the domestic business and balance of payments situations, and also with his policy prescription. Mr. Shepardson observed that he continued to have some of the same concern that Mr. Hickman had, but in light of the uncertainties existing at this time he felt that it would probably be better procedure to maintain present policy. 3/3/64 -69- Mr. Robertson said he agreed that monetary policy should continue unchanged for the present. Because the statement he had prepared closely resembled Mr. Bopp\\'s presentation, he would like to insert it in the record but not deliver it orally. As far as the directive was concerned, he shared the concern of Mr. Daane. He would prefer to continue the present directive and to consider the staff proposals at the next meeting. Note: Mr. Robertson\\'s prepared statement was as follows: With the tax cut finally an accomplished fact, it seems fair to say that our over-all economi: policies are now better balanced than at any other time in recent years. Hopefully, we can now reap the benefit of this improved policy \"mix\" in a strengthened but sound and sustainable rate of economic growth without inflation. To be sure, none of us knows exactly what the response of the economy will be. If it should bring on a wave of speculative ebullience and price inflation, I think monetary action should be in the forefront of policy steps taken to resist the upsurge. If, on the other hand, the tax cut falls flat as a stimulative device, then monetary policy, along with other governmental policies, will have to go through an agonizing reappraisal to determine what else can be done to deal with the stubborn under employment of our resources. Until it is clear what the effects of the tax cut are turning out to be, think monetary policy ought to continue unchanged. I think our judgment to \"wail and see\" should not be shaken by last week\\'s boost in the Bank Rate. The British have their own problems, to which their official rate increase is attuned. Our financial system has in good part been insulated from the arbitrage effects of the higher London rates by the usual offsetting adjustment in the cost of forward exchange cover. In the circumstances, I see no valid reason for compounding both their problems and ours at this juncture by fostering an upward adjustment in U. S. market rates. Considering the fact that our money market still seems to possess some doubts as to whether we will follow the British lead, I would favor a policy of maintaining at least as much reserve availability over the next few weeks as we have had in the last two or three weeks, taking such opportunities 3/3/64 -70 as that policy permits for allaying market fears that the Federal Reserve may be tightening the credit reins. I would hope and expect that such action on our part would lead to some reversal of the recent dealer mark-ups in bill rates and provide a calmer financial atmosphere in which the effects of the tax cut can be observed at work both in our domestic economy and in our balance of payments. Mr. Mills said that the comments he would make would bear on an interpretation of recent movements of statistics relative to the supply of reserves and the interest rate structure, and would have to do with the policy of \"no change,\" or \"watchful waiting\" as it was now termed. He then made the following statenent: During the month of February movements in short-term interest rates, particularly the yield on 3-month U. S. Treasury bills and the rate on Federal funds, have been insignificant, contrasted to a modest down trend in the supply of reserves and a rise in the average total of member bank borrowings at the Federal Reserve Banks. Excess re serves fell during the period at the same time that member bank borrowings composed a larger part of their total. A greater reduction in total reserves would have occurred if the projections in their movements on which the Manager of the System Open Market Account based his calculations for supulying or withdrawing reserves had materialized. In the event, unforeseen movements in the supply of reserves lifted theaverage of free reserves over the period to a higher level than had been projected. This summarized statistical record leads me to the inescapable conclusion that, because of interest rate con siderations, recent open market operations were meant to contract the supply of reserves at the disposal of the commercial banking system. The fact that short-term interest rates did not rise above the general averages ruling in recent weeks seems to have been the result of fortuitous circumstances rather than of conscious effort in the handling of open market operations. Matching the statistics referred to against the authorization and directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York adopted by the Committee at its recent meetings, it seems to me to oe correct to believe that the general directive 3/3/64 -71- of \"no change\" in reality was intended to result in whatever reduction in the supply of reserves would be necessary to produce a predetermined level of short-term interest rates. The over-all result of compliance with the Committee\\'s directive has been a shift toward a more restrictive credit policy at a time when the national economy still needs the nourishing benefits of adequate credit availability. The fact that short-term interest rates have held steady is unimportant as contrasted to the tightening that has taken place in the credit markets. Although the moves toward a more restrictive credit policy will have found favor in the eyes of some members of the Committee and was accomplished in the name of \"maintaining about the same conditions in the money market as have prevailed in recent weeks,\" it cannot be gainsaid that under present conditions a Federal Reserve System policy which has riveted attention on preserving intact an existing structure of short-term interest rates is implicitly a policy of credit restriction. What might be termed a conflict between a viable credit policy and an interest rate policy fixation may be expected to continue as long as there is adherence to the concept of a pegged U. S. Government securities market and the artificial manipulation of interest rates. In the light of the above, a further extension of the Committee\\'s present directive of \"no change\" would indicate a definite shift toward a restrictive credit policy which, in my opinion, would be objectionable. Mr. Hayes said that he would take exception to Mr. Mills\\' suggestion that the Desk had been deliberately trying to tighten money market conditions rather than to preserve an atmosphere of no change, to which Mr. Mills replied that in introducing his statement he had specified that it was an interpretation of recent statistics. Mr. Wayne reported that Fifth District business activity had made distinct gains in recent weeks, and business sentiment was more optimistic than it was earlier in the year. In January, factory man-hours declined quite generally, but employment was up in manufacturing, as it was in most other nonfarm categories, and in the Bank\\'s Latest survey manufacturers 3/3/64 -72 reported increases on balance in employment and hours, together with widespread gains in new orders, backlogs, and shipments. Industry spokesmen reported that shortages of employable labor had contributed to substantial amounts of overtime work in furniture plants and small amounts of idle machine capacity in textile mills. Textile prices remained firm and demand appeared strong, although the flow of orders had slowed again as Congress resumed consideration of the one-price cotton bill. January Internal Revenue collections on cigarette factory shipment in North Carolina and Virginia were 5 per cent lower than a year ago, and most cigarette plants were still on reduced schedules with some still operating on a three-day week. Gross loans of weekly reporting banks had risen more than seasonally in recent weeks, and increases in business and real estate loans had been particularly sharp. Mr. Wayne said that he fcund himself in general agreement with the analysis presented by Mr. Hayes, and would add only that consumers might have already anticipated the tax cut. During 1963 total consumer indebtednss, including consumers\\' real estate debt, had increased nearly 10 per cent while disposable personal income had risen only 5 per cent. He doubted that debt could continue indefini:ely to increase twice as fast as income, and he felt that when the trend was reversed it was likely to exert a dampening effect on activity. As to policy, Mr. Wayne said that he agreed with Mr. Hayes\\' views. While he would defer comment on the directive until he had seen the staff 3/3/64 -73 drafts, he concurred with Messrs. Daane and Robertson as to the need for avoiding any suggestion of change in policy, such as might result. from changes in the words used in the directive. He did not favor a change in the discount rate. Mr. Clay commented that the long-awaited tax cut had been enacted, and the course of events that would flow from that action might prove to be important for the formulation of monetary policy in the months ahead. To what extent and in what specific way monetary policy would be affected by reason of that action could not be judged at this time, however. It was reasonable, Mr. Clay said, to assume that the tax cut would prove to be a stimulus to the economy, but it was not known what the nature of the stimulus would be. Specifically, the amount, composition, and timing of increases in consumer buying were not known. Moreover, there were important uncertainties relative to the timing and amount of expansion in capital expenditures and inventory investment stemming from increases in consumption and from corporate tax ,eduction. The current performance of the economy continued to be one of moderate expansion at a high level of activity, with a satisfactory price situation and inadquate resource utilization. Moreover, in the area of manpower it needed to be recognized that labor force growth would be accelerating in the months ahead. To inject restraint into monetary policy at this time would put the Committee in the position of counteracting the as yet unquantified stimulus provided by the tax cut. Such action would 3/3/64 -74 not appear justified, Mr. Clay thought, unless and until the Committee was faced with a different set of circumstances. The principal new factor injected into the international area in recent days was the increase in the British discount rate. Here, too, it was impossible to know the outline of subsequent events, and a watchful attitude would appear to be the most appropriate course while awaiting further developments. In the period immediately ahead, Mr. Clay said, reserve availability should be continued about as heretofore, thereby being sufficient to permit moderate bank credit expansion on a seasonally adjusted basis. The Federal funds rate presumably would be at 3-1/2 per cent most of the time, but there should be no effort to push Treasury bill rates up. For policy purposes, the Committee\\'s directive was satisfactory in its present form. However, in view of the developments that had transpired since it was first adopted in essentially its present form, a case could be made for rewriting it. Mr. Clay felt :he Federal Reserve Bank discount rate should not be changed. Mr. Scanlon reported that business and financial leaders in the Seventh District remained optimistic. Output of major District industries, including the auto industry, continued strong. Since Mr. Koch had commented on the outlook for labor negotiations, Mr. Scanlon said, he would add that the U.A.W. was moving into this year\\'s contract negotiations in the strongest financial position in its 28-year history; its strike fund was substantial. 3/3/64 -75 Available evidence indicated a high Level of retail trade in the Seventh District in January and February, Mr. Scanlon continued. At the same time there had been a marked slowing in the growth of savings and time accounts, both at banks and savings and loan associations. Exceptions to this were the Indiana banks, which were able to increase their rates on savings and time accounts above the 3 per cent ceiling previously in force starting January 1. Many did so, and savings and time accounts at these banks roe sharply. Mr. Scanlon reported that one of the most significant factors in the agricultural economy of the District had been relatively low cattle prices in recent months. In the week ending February 22 prices for choice steers at Chicago were the lowest foc the period since 1944 when price controls were in effect. Weak prices reflected very heavy marketings of choice beef--40 per cent more than last year in January. The reduced number of heavy cattle on feed in January suggested a reduction in cattle slaughter and stronger prices in the next few months. Banking data indicated that credit demand in the first three weeks of February was less strong in the Seventh District than in the U. S. However, over the past year outstanding busiiess loans at District weekly reporting banks rose 12 per cent compared to a rise of 9 per cent for the nation. Chicago banks had increased purchases of Federal funds and borrowings at the discount window, Mr. Scanlon said. In part this 3/3/64 -76 reflected purchases of Government securities, during the February refunding. The period was approaching when these banks normally developed a large basic deficit osition as they prepared for the April 1 personal property tax assessment date. Their bill inventories were about $150 million below the year-ago level, but they feLt they would have no difficulty acquiring the needed bills at a later date, in many instances on a delayed delivery basis. Positions of other District banks showed no unusual reserve pressure Hr. Scanlon believed it was clear that this was no time to change policy. For reasons advanced by Mr. Daane and others he did not favor a change in the directive and he would continue the current discount rate. Mr. Dening reported that economic activity in the Ninth District appeared to have advanced moderately since the first of the year. Non agricultural employment had improved, on a seasonally adjusted basis;; the industrial use of electrical power moved up 5 index points in January from December; retail sales and bank debits were up; the backlog of construction projects was high; and January personal incomes were up 2 per cent from December. As anticipated, cash farm incomes improved substantially after the first of the year as farmers marketed products held over into the new tax year. Cattle inventories on the first of the year were up 8 per cent from a year earlier but the total value was less because of a 3/3/64 -77 sharply lower price level. There was concern about this drastic decline in livestock prices with costs continuing tc creep up. Twin City manufacturers currently reporting to the Minneapolis Bank indicated that the rate of production and the volume of back orders was up in most plants. Nevertheless, employment and hours worked had remained about the same with prices received showing no significant change. Generally these manufacturers were moderately optimistic as to their factory output in the second quarter. The demand for loans had been on the slow side since the first of the year, Mr. Deming said. Commercial and industrial loan demand, par ticularly, had been moderate. Total deposits at District member banks changed in February at about average rates for the period. Deposit gains in the first three weeks of the month were about equally split between demand and time. District banks continued to be net sellers of Federal funds as they had been since late December with the exception of one week in late January. Only a very few banks borrowed from the Federal Reserve Bank in the last week in February--only two banks were listed at the end of the month. Mr. Deming said that he agreed with the consensus that seemed to be forming for no change in policy during the next three weeks and no change in the discount rate. He would interpret no change in policy as encompassing a bill rate around the 3.60 per cent level rather than at some lower level, if that was how things turned out. With respect to 3/3/64 -78 the directive, Mr. Deming observed, he would be interested in seeing the drafts the staff had prepared but at present he Leaned toward the views expressed by Mr. Daane and Mr. Robertson. Mr. Swan said that in the Twelfth District economic activity apparently rose somewhat further in January and early February. Housing starts in January increased more sharply in the District than in the nation. Conditions continued to be relatively favorable in the lumber, steel, and nonferrous materials industries. However, there was a rise in unemployment in January, following a reduction in December. The unemployment rate for the Pacific Coast States in January was back up to nearly 6 pe: cent. A development that might have considerable long-term significance, Mr. Swan continued, was that the major agricultural organizations in California had decided not to press for continuation after 1964 of the 12-year old foreign labor program. The serious unemployment situation in California was the reason given for the decision, although it probably also reflected a feeling that Congress might not be willing to extend the program again, and that there was litt\\'.e use in fighting for it. Only about 75,000 workers would be needed to replace the foreigr labor. However, there were many questions involving housing, labor mobility, and wage rates, and he thought the result was likely to be somewhat higher costs for agriculture and more mechanization. 3/3/64 -79 Total credit and demand deposits at District member banks declined less than seasonally in January, Mr. Swan reported. The gains in time and savings deposits were greater than in any other January in the post-war period. As to policy, Mr. Swan said, he agreed with Mr. Hayes that this was not a time to make a change. In this connection it seemed to Mr. Swan quite important that the Committee not provide the market with any basis for expectation of a policy change. Accordingly, he would hope that \"continuation of the same conditions\" would encompass no decline in net free reserves and no increase in member bank borrowings, since these tended to be looked at, rightly or wrongly, as signals of policy. Under present circumstances it was likely that the market would watch these figures more closely than ordinarily. He also shared the reluctance that some had expressed about changing the directive. Mr. Irons reported that as far as the Eleventh District was concerned there had not been any significant changes recently. On the whole, activity continued on a high level, with some more or less seasonal movements. He agreed with Mr. Hayes with respect to policy. As to the directive, while he had not seen the proposed revisions, he was inclined against change. Mr. Ellis said that he would comment on three aspects of the economic situation in the First District. First, the electronics industry, which had been so important in the area\\'s recovery from the 3/3/64 -80 decline in the textile and shoe industries, was itself having difficulty because of inward competition in the market; for private products and because of some lessening of Government contracts going to New England firms. Secondly, a regional survey of manufacturing investment plans indicated that investment outlays in 1964 would be 25 per cent higher than in 1963. The electronics component of the electrical machinery group showed a 20 per cent decline in planned capital investment, but the rest of the group showed an offsetting increase of 18 per cent. Thirdly, consumer credit terms were continuing to loosen. In January, 73 per cent of commercial bank loans on new cars had maturities of 30 months or more--which in effect meant 3 years--as compared with 71 ;,er cent in December and 71 per cent a year ago. On direct loans, the rise from December in three-year contracts was spectacular--from 54 per cent to 61 per cent Turning to monetary policy, Mr. Ellis said that he felt un comfortable with the consensus that had developed around the table. With strong and rising effective demands from business, consumers, and governmert, and with the stimulating effect of the tax cut, conventional wisdom clearly supported the expectation of an expanding economy over the rest of the year. The extent to which there would be excesses requiring correction was not yet clear. But it was reasonable to expect that the prevailing tendency would be for inflationary forces to strengthen and prices to rise. In this context one could not expect credit demand 3/3/64 -81 to be less than it had been last year. Thus, the Committee could not logically anticipate any slackening from 1963\\'s 8 per cent rate of increase in bank credit. There had been a pickup in bank credit in late February, Mr. Ellis noted. The bill rate could be expected to remain in the 3.50-3.60 per cent range, he thought, only if the Committee continued to provide the reserves necessary to permit bank credit ex pansion at an 8 per cent rate. Considering domestic economic factors alone, to suggest that no change should be made in monetary policy before the next Treasury financing was to argue that the present rate of credit expansion was .;ustainable and was not contributing to a later need for adjustment. In Mr. Ellis\\' judgment such a view was not tenable, and he concluded that a reduction of monetary ease--although not a move to tightness--was desirable. If the Committee did not act at this particular meeting, he said, it might be blocked out by Treasury financings for two or three month:;. It seemed likely to him that covered international interest rate differentials would continue to move against the U. S., and that capital outflows would tend to resume, which would increase the desirability of action by the Committee. He would like to accept the \"clear evidence\" criterion that Mr. Bopp had suggested, but in his opinion the evidence that action was needed might emerge around the end of March, when Treasury financing activity would call for an even keel. He favored having the Desk pay more attention to the rate of reserve expansion, and 3/3/64 -82 adhere more clcsely to the language of the directive calling for accommodating \"moderate\" expansion of bank reserves. With respect to Mr. Noyes\\' proposal for changing the directive, it seemed to him unlikely that there would be a time between now and June when the Committee did not have its present inhibition against changing the language; and later, the desirability of an even keel policy would offer an additional inhibition. Mr. Balderston noted that three weeks ago Mr. Holland had suggested in his presentation that the Committee might cease trying to iron out every little fluctuation in money market conditions. Mr. Koch recently had made the same suggestion at a meeting of the Board, and had commented as follows: Such a revised modus operandi would not only minimize the value judgments the Manager has to make which are often extremely difficult both to justify and to make the market and other outside observers understand (witness Professor Meltzer\\'s recent critical comments), but it would also tend to introduce more short-run variation in money market rates of interest--something that most of us feel would make for a better furctioning money market. Of course the transition to a less precise stabilization of money market conditions by the Trading Desk would pose some temporary problems, for in the process the market might interpret a short-run deviation in conditions to be one of longer-run s gnificance. Incidentally, I am bothered by a much more fundamental criticism of using money market conditions as a short-run guide to policy. Doesn\\'t it mean that we automatically and for a prolonged period of time accommodate any increased demand for money market funds as well as absorb any excess supply of funds, without letting them have an effect on their cost? And, if so, is this really what we want? 3/3/64 -83 Mr. Balderston thought it useful to remind the Committee of these suggestions, now that the bill rate hid moved out of its earlier narrow range of fluctuations. On policy, Mr. Balderston said, he concurred with the views of Mr. Hayes. The immediate task of the Committee was to choose between the risks of delay (in view of the well-known time lags between policy actions and results), on the one hand, and taking overt actions that would unnecessarily vitiate what the Congress sought to accomplish by fiscal methods on the other. One thing was obvious: the Committee did not need to add to the credit ease that existed. What was not so obvious was when it should pull on the reins. He felt that a policy of watchful waiting should be followed in the immediate future, until some word reached the Committee of an increased outflow of funds abroad, or until a number of prices advanced. Clearly, credit policy must lead the evils that it should prevent, Mr. Balderston observed, but the question was how great the lead must be. He suspected that the lead had to be longer to curb price ebullience than to stem a flow of funds abroad. His conclusion was that the Committee should not wait too long in stemming a price advance if one was in the making. Mr. Balderston said he understood why so many of the Committee had suggested no change in policy at this moment, but he was unhappy enough with the present economic directive to want to see the staff 3/3/64 -84 suggestions. He felt that the events of the past week-the tax cut and the British Bank rate action--would make a revision of the directive at this time understandable and explicable in t.he record. On the other hand, it was not clear to him how a change in wording or format at the next meeting could be explained in the record, if the decision then was not to change policy. Mr. Daane remarked that in calling for no change in the directive he had not meant to imply that he was opposed to inserting language in the first paragraph taking note of the tax cut and the British Bank rate action. His concern was with the second, implementing paragraph. Chairman Martin commented that he did not think the Committee had to fear that every change in the directive, including those intended merely to briny the language up to date, would be taken to imply a change in policy. It seemed to him that if the Committee wished to make some reference to the current tax cut and the Bank rate increase, this was as good a time as any. The Committee should not assume that the Desk would modify its operations as a result. At this point the Secretary distributed the staff memorandum containing drafts of revised directives, which is appended to these minutes as Attachment A. In the discussion that followed, several members of the Committee expressed the opinion that both alternatives A and B among the staff drafts were improvements over the Committee\\'s present directive. Mr. Daane 3/3/64 -85 commented, with respect to the second paragraphs, that he had some sympathy for the proposed Language but did not think that this was the appropriate time to introduce language of this type. Mr. Hayes said he did not thirk either of the alternative directives was satisfactory. He objected to the first paragraph of the drafts because they dropped the reference to \"the increases in bank credit, money supply, and the reserve base of recent months\" and instead mentioned only the lack of growth in aggregate bank reserves since the turn of the year. While bank reserved had indeed shown a downward drift in the recent past, the time period referred to was quite short, and the longer run trends in bank credit, money, and reserves were still strongly upward. Quite a few members had expressed concern about these longer run trends, and he thought this language revision was inappropriate. With respect to the second paragraphs of the drafts, he did not think they were consistent with the consensus for no change in policy. Mcreover, they introduced the notion of not offsetting small changes. This suggested a departure in techniques and it involved language that he frankly .ould not know how to interpret. Mr. Mitchell said that in his earlier comment about the directive he had sought to make the point that the Committee should specify its intentions more clearly. He thought that in presenting these alternatives the staff was trying to get the Committee to move in the right direction. 3/3/64 -86 He hoped the Committee would not discard the staff proposals hastily, and would return to them at the next meeting. Chairman Martin said that he shared this hope. However, it seemed clear that some Committee members were worried that any change in language would be taken to mean a change in policy. He personally did not read the language of the drafts as implying a policy change, and he understood that the intent in preparing them was not to suggest a policy change. Mr. Hayes said that he did not disagree with Mr. Mitchell\\'s objectives, but he doubted that the wording of the drafts would achieve them. It seemed to him that the Committee should distinguish between adding language to the first paragraph to recognize the tax cut and the British Bank rate action, which he favored, and recasting the whole directive. Mr. Stone said he would like to make a technical observation on the proposed phrase, \"without action to offset small changes that reflect market adaptations to forces judged to be temporary.\" A number of Committee members and staff had commenced recently on the narrow fluctua tions in the money market. It was important to know why the fluctuations had been narrow. One main factor was the size and efficiency of the market, and its capacity to accommodate fluctuations. The market had grown sub stantially; a cluster of transactions of a volume that only two or three years ago would have produced rather severe temporary changes in market conditions now could be accommodated without a ripple. 3/3/64 -87 The second major factor, Mr. Stone said, was the current policy posture of the Committee. If free reserves were of the order of $300- $500 million, there would be a large volume of excess reserves moving about in the banking system, causing fluctuations in market conditions as they shifted between country and city banks and into and out of major money market :enters. However, free reserves recently had been in the neighborhood of $100 million, and there was no large volume of excess reserves to move about and produce fluctuations in the process. Mr. Stone said he suspected that there would be wider fluctuations in market conditicns if the Committee\\'s policy posture was such as to produce net borrowed reserves on the order of $300-$400 million. Then member bank borrowing probably would average about $600-$800 million, and the intra weekly pattern probably would be quite different, with borrowings rising to $900 million or $1 billion on some days. His guess was that sharp changes in borrowings of perhaps $300-$400 million in one day would produce more changes in the market than occurred now when the Committee\\'s policy posture was more nearly neutral, and there were neither large excess reserves nor large borrowings. Mr. Stone said he thought it would be quite difficult to implement the phrase he had mentioned, and an effort to do so would require changes that ought to be spelled out carefully in advance, so that the Committee would be aware of the implications. In general, he thought that the question was complicated. 3/3/64 -88 Mr. Mitchell said he felt Mr. Stone was making the matter complicated. It was his understanding that the Desk had not interfered with market expectations recently, and had let the bill rate rise to 3.60 per cent; and that it did not propose to interfere if present expectations were abandoned and the bill rate declined. This was precisely what the language in the second paragraphs of A and B was intended to imply that the Manager should do. Mr. Stone noted that the clause in question called for not offsetting small changes due to forces \"judged to be temporary.\" Yesterday, to take a recent example, net borrowed reserves averaging $30 million were projected for the current statement week. A free reserve projection had been expected but because of a decline in float and a rise in required reserves over the weekend that projection did not develop. The decline in float was clearly temporary, but he had :no way of knowing whether the required reserve increase was temporary or not. If the clause was used, he would be put in the position of having to guess whether such changes were temporary. After further discussion, it was decided to incorporate references to the tax cut and the Bank rate change in the Committee\\'s directive, but to make no other changes. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following economic directive: 3/3/64 -89- It is the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s current policy to accommodate moderate growth in bank credit, while maintain ing conditions in the money market that would contribute to continued improvement in the capital account of the U. S. balance of payments. This polic, takes into consideration the fact that domestic economic activity is expanding further, although with a margin of underutilized resources, and that it is likely to receive additional stimulus from the recently enacted reduction in Federal income tax rates. This policy also takes into account the fact that the balance of payments position is still adverse, despite a tendency to reduced deficits, and that the effects of increases in money rates in important European countries are as yet uncertain. In addition, it recognizes the increases in bank credit, money supply, and the reserve base of recent months. To implement this policy, System Open Market operations shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the same conditions in the money market as have prevailed in recent weeks, while accommodating moderate expansion in aggregate banK reserves. Votes for this action: Messrs. Martin, Hayes, Balderston, Daane, Hickman, Mitchell, Robertson, Shepardson, Shuford, Swan, and Wayne. Vote against this action: Mr. Mills. Mr. Mills said he dissented from the action in light of developments since the beginning of February which indicated to him that under the policy of \"no change\" the Committee had moved toward restriction. Chairman Martin reported that in connection with the request of the Subcommittee on Domestic Finance for the Committee\\'s minutes for recent years, he had asked the Secretariat to prepare excerpts from the minutes for 1961, 1962, and 1963, for examination by Secretary Dillon, which were illustrative of the foreign currency discussions and of other material of potential interest to the Treasury. The Secretary had informed him (Chairman Martin) yesterday that he had serious qualms about having certain 3/3/64 -90 material in these minutes made public, and that the Treasury probably would object. Further negotiations, in which the Treasury would participate, would therefore be necessary before the Committee was in a position to act on the request for the minutes for the years 1961, 1962, and 1963. On the subject of releasing older minutes generally, the Chairman said, his own thinking was that the Committee might follow the course the majority seemed to favor at the last meeting: to make the minutes through 1960 available to scholars and others, by methods to be worked out by the Secretariat along the lines indicated in the memorandum from Messrs. Sherman and Ycung dated February 28, 1964. In the meantime, the Committee could continue to consider what course it should follow with respect to the minutes from 1961, 1962, and 1963. Mr. Hayes asked whether the minutes through 1960 should be examined to determine whether they included sensitive material. The Chairman replied that he thought it would be useful for the members to re-read these older minutes, but on the basis of his reading of the minutes it was his feeling that the question of sensitive material arose in the period after 1960. Mr. Daane said that he accepted the Chairman\\'s view on this matter, but he had reservations about making the minutes freely available to everyone simultaneously. It would be his preference to give competent scholars first access to them, and to maintain contacts with them as their work proceeded. Messrs. Hayes and Deming expressed agreement. 3/3/64 -91 Mr. Shepardson commented that he thought the Committee should make its records available to all simultaneously, without restrictions, and to take its chances on having good or bad analyses made of them. Mr. Robertson expressed a similar view. Mr. Young observed that if the Committee made its records available to all there undoubtedly would be some dubious uses made of them, but there also would be studies by mature, competent scholars. Most of the people who analyzed the records would get financing from foundations, and the foundation officials with whom he had talked had made it clear that they would be prepared to give grants only to competent scholars. Of course, some enterrrising people might go ahead on their own. Mr. Hayes asked whether Chairman Martin thought that the release of minutes through 1960 would set a precedent that would make it more difficult to withhold those for later years, and the Chairman replied that this was a matter of judgment. In his opinion, if the Committee established the principle of a moderate time lag before release of the minutes, no undesirable precedent would be set. Mr. Hayes said that there was some question in his mind as to whether some of the sensitive material in the more recent minutes which the Secretary of the Treasury had noted--particularly that relating to confidential discussions with foreign officials--should ever be made public. 3/3/64 -92 Chairman Martin replied that this subject would be discussed with the Treasury Department and others. Following this discussion, it was agreed that the Secretariat should proceed along the lines the Chairman had suggested, and keep the Committee informed of its progress. Mr. Daane said that he thought the Committee should consider the content of its minutes carefully as it went forward, and Chairman Martin agreed noting that there were both advantages and disadvantages to the present form of minutes. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, March 24, 1964. The meeting then adjourned. Secretary 3/3/64 -93- ATTACHMET A March 2, 1964. Draft current economic poLicy directives suggested for consideration by the Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting on March 3, 1964 The Committee\\'s current economic policy directive adopted at the last meeting reads as follows: It is the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s current policy to accommodate moderate growth in bank credit, while maintaining conditions in the money market that would contribute to continued improvement in the capital account of the U. S. balance of payments. This policy takes into consideration the fact that domestic economic activity is expanding further, although with a margin of underutilized resources; and the fact that the balance of payments position is still adverse despite a tendency to reduced deficits. It also recognizes the increases in bank credit, money supply, and the reserve base of recent months. To implement this policy, System open market operations shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the same conditions in the money market as have prevailed in recent weeks, while accommodating moderate expansion in aggregate bank reserves. In view of the tax cut enactment, the rise in the British benk rate, and the recent reversal of trend in aggregate bank reserves, this directive would appear to need revision,, particularly as regards the first paragraph. Several alternative revisions, all consistent with no change in policy, are suggested below: Alternative A: The Federal Open Market Committee notes that domestic economic activity continues to expand at a moderate pace with a margin of unutilized resources, but is likely to 3/3/64 -94 receive additional strong stimulus over coming months from the recently enacted reduction in Federal income tax rates. The Committee also notes that aggregate bank reserves have not expanded since the turn of the year. It further notes that the U. S. balance of international payments, while still adverse, continues to reflect the improvement that occurred in the second half of 1963, and that the effects on the capital account of the payments balance of recent increases in money rates: ir important European markets are as yet uncertain. In the light of these developments, it is the Committee\\'s current policy to facilitate further expansion in domestic activity and to contribute to a more sustainable position in the capital account of U. S. international payments. For the next three weeks, System open market operations shall be conducted with a view to continuing about the same degree of firmness in the money market as has prevailed on average during recent weeks, without action to offset small changes that reflect market adaptations to forces judged to be tem porary. The Committee expects that operations so conducted will be consistent with resumption of an upward trend in aggregate bank reserves. 3/3/64 -95 Alternative B: It is the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s current policy to accommodate moderate growth in the reserve base, bank credit and the money supply in order to facilitate the financing of further expansion of domestic economic activity, while maintaining conditions in the money market that would help attain a better position for the capital account of U. S. international payments. This policy takes into consideration the continuing expansion of domestic activity, which is expected to receive additional strong stimulus from the recently enacted tax reduction; the lack of growth in aggregate bank reserves since the turn of the year; the country\\'s improved, though still adverse, inter national payments position; and the recent rise in money rates in important European markets. To implement this policy, System open market operations shall be conducted with a view to continuing for the next three weeks about the same degree of firmness in the money market as has prevailed on average during recent weeks, without action to offset small changes that reflect market adaptations to forces judged to be temporary. The Committee expects that operations so conducted will be consistent with resumption of an upward trend in aggregate bank reserves. 3/3/64 -96 Alternative C: Alternative A with second paragraph of present directive used in place of last two sentences.

       " 'A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held in the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington on Tuesday, March 24, 1964, at 9:30 a.m. PRESENT: Mr. Martin, Chairman Mr. Hayes, Vice Chairman Mr. Balderston Mr. Daane Mr. Hickman Mr. Mills Mr. Mitchell Mr. Robertson Mr. Shepardson Mr. Shuford Mr. Swan Mr. Wayne Messrs.

Holmes, Eastburn, Baughman, Tow, and Green, Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas, respectively Messrs. Sternliht and Brandt, Assistant Vice Presidents cf the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Atlanta, respectively Messrs. Eisenmenger and Lynn, Directors of Research at the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and San Francisco, respectively Upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Com mittee held on March 3, 1964, were approved. Before this meeting there had been distributed to the members of the Committee a report from the Special Manager of the System Open Market Account on foreign exchange market conditions and on Open Market Account and Treasury operations in foreign currencies for the period March 3 through March 18, 1964, and a supplementary report covering the period March 19 through March 23, 1964. Copies of these reports have been placed in the files of the Committee. Supplementing the written reports, Mr. Coombs said that the gold stock would remain unchanged this week for the sixth week in a row. Meanwhile, the Stabilization Fund had been acquiring gold through the London gold market where the Russians were heavy sellers last week. Total Russian sales last week amounted to approximately $150 million, of which $137 million was acquired by the Pool. Accordingly, he said, an interim distribution of $107 million was made on March 23, of which the 3/24/64 -3 U. S. share was $67.5 million. The Pool still held another $40 million which would be available for distribution at the month end. Mr. Coombs said that unless there were some unexpected gold orders in sizable amounts, the U. S. should be able to get through at least the next month or six weeks without showing a reduction in the gold stock. On the exchanges, Mr. Coombs continued, the major development had been the appearance of a potentially dangerous speculative attack on the lira. Governor Carli of the Bank of Italy had spent most of the week before last in Washington and New York in negotiating credit assist ance. The package finally put together amounted to $1 billion, comprised of: (1) the $150 million remaining under the System\\'s swap line with the Bank of Italy; (2) a Treasury swap of $100 million with the Bank of Italy, plus Treasury purchases of $33 million of lire for use in retiring the Treasury\\'s lire bonds outstanding; (3) a Bank of England credit of $100 million; (4) a Bundesbank credit of $150 million; and (5) medium-term credits by the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation in the an amount of $450 million. While this package was being negotiated, Mr. Coombs said, speculative pressure on the lira was building up rapidly and, on Friday of that week, the Bank of Italy lost $60 million in defense operations while the one-month forward lira went to a discount of nearly 10 per cent. In this atmosphere it seemed desirable to make an immediate announcement of the program over the weekend. The exchange market subsequently 3/24/64 -4 reacted very favorably. The discount on the three-month forward lira narrowed to 3 per cent and the Bank of Italy seemed to have taken in some dollars during the past week. While in Washington, Governor Carli also negotiated an Italian drawing on the Fund in the amount of $225 million which might be employed to repay the Bank of Italy\\'s drawings of $150 million on the swap line with the System. Mr. Coombs reported that the speculative drive on the lira that occurred on March 13 had been accompanied by a heavy inflow into Germany which the System had absorbed in part by a further drawing on the mark swap. Since then, the German mark market had remained in reasonable balance. In addition to the Bundesbank\\'s program of dollar swaps with German commercial banks, which Mr. Coombs had mentioned at the last meeting of the Committee, the German Government had subsequently prohibitec the payment of interest on nonresident time deposits and also had sharply increased reserve requirements against foreign deposits. Today, the German Government was announcing a proposal to apply a withholding tax on income derived from foreign investment in German securities. Meanwhile, the operations in the spot and forward markets in German marks apparently had had a reassuring effect. Mr. Coombs thought that all of these measures in combination should have a useful effect in restraining the short- and long-term inflows into Germany. In the case of the Swiss franc, there still was not a sizable outflow of funds from Zurich, mainly owing, Mr. Coombs thought, to a 3/24/64 -5 further tightening of credit lines there. As a consequence, progress in repaying the System\\'s Swiss franc swap drawings remained disappointingly slow--only $15 million had been repaid so far this month--and the System\\'s debtor position under the Swiss franc swap lines remained at the very high level of $205 million. In April, however, negotiations might be completed for further Treasury issues of Swiss franc obligations which might give the System an opportunity to repay as much as $75 million in one operation. There was also the possibility that the Swiss National Bank might extend short-term credits to the Bank of Italy which would open up further scope for the System to acquire Swiss francs against dollars and reduce its swap drawings correspondingly. Mr. Hayes remarked that in the course of the negotiations on the Italian problem it had been suggested that the System enlarge its swap line with the Bank of Italy. He thought it was gratifying that the negotiations had been completed without an increase in the line and he found it particularly gratifying that there was some European participation in the arrangements that had been made. There was plenty of money in Europe, Mr. Hayes said, and short of a real crisis it seemed sensible for the System not to stretch its position. Mr. Scanlon noted that in the staff paper on Italian developments circulated under Mr. Young\\'s memorandum of March 9, 1964, the question of an increase in the Italian swap line had been raised. He asked whether the Italians themselves had pressed for such an increase. 3/24/64 Mr. Young said that the matter had arisen in the course of the discussions, but there had been no pressure. After consideration, it was decided that the best approach would be to elicit some funds from Europe. If these funds had not been available the problem would have been more acute, and the System might have had to enlarge the swap. If the Italians encountered additional needs it was possible that they would still request an enlargement of the swap line, but it was not likely that any such request wou.d be made until later this year or until next year, if at all. Mr. Mitchell asked how the $450 million medium-term credits extended to the Italians by the Export-Import Bank and the CCC would be disbursed. Mr. Furth said that of the total $200 million credit granted by the Export-Import Bank, $100 million had been made available more or less as a balance of payments loan; that is, on a basis similar to that of the Export-Import Bank loan made to the United Kingdom at the time of the sterling difficulties in 1956. The loan was tied to U. S. exports, though not necessarily to additional exports. But this point was of little significance because Italy\\'s imports of capital goods from the United States were so heavy that there were always some orders that could qualify as \"additional\" shipments. The remaining $100 million would be allocated for individual projects to be submitted at a future date. The CCC loan was tied to additional exports of foodstuffs. 3/24/64 Mr. Mitchell commented that he thought the Italians were trying to restrict imports, and Mr. Furth said that this objective related primarily to consumer goods, particularly autos, but not to capital equipment, for which their needs continued heavy. Food imports were involved because there had been a revolution in patterns of food con sumption with rises in the Italian standard of living. Mr. Robertson said that if a real need developed in Italy which could not be met abroad, he would hope there. would be no reluctance on the part of the Committee to permit the Italians to draw on the full swap line, nor to increase the size of the line if necessary. Mr. Daane said he shared this view. Mr. Hayes said he would feel no hesitancy about drawings on the existing $250 million swap line if there was a real need, but he thought that the Committee should give any proposal to increase the size of the line close examination. Mr. Coombs said that a sizable increase in any one swap line in the absence of a serious emergency might create expectations of a third round of general increases, and might therefore be undesirable. Als., he thought the Committee would want to encourage European central banks to carry part of the burden, and not leave it wholly to the U. S. Mr. Daane commented that other European countries had reacted quite negatively to the Italian credit assistance package because of their feeling that Italy\\'s program for dealing with its balance of pay ments problem did not go far enough to be effective, and that the package 3/24/64 -8 reduced the pressure to take effective action. Mr. Coombs added that there also was some question of whether the Italians had been suffi ciently active in soliciting help from others. Mr. Ellis noted that the French were not taking part in the program of assistance to Italy. He asked whether there was any possibility of improving the techniques used in negotiations of this type in a manner that would result in French participation. Mr. Coombs replied the Bank of Italy had not approached the Bank of France. Mr. Daane commented that the program had been put together quickly, because of the rapid deterioration in the Italian position. As a result, there was a mechanical problem in bringing many countries in. Chairman Martin added that the Italians had experienced a real run on Friday, March 13. This precipitated the closing of the package; otherwise the arrangements might have been worked out over a period of several weeks. Mr. Coombs said he thought it would be desirable for the System\\'s swap network to be supplemented by arrangements among the European countries themselves. The Bank of England, he noted, had solicited help from continental countries as well as from the U. S. when they had encountered difficulties in the past. The important principal, he thought, was that European countries should rely on one another as well as on the U. S. 3/24/64 Mr. Robertson said he also felt that this principle was important. However, in any case of real need, he did not think the System should withhold assistance simply because it might disrupt its network of swap arrangements. To this, Mr. Coombs responded that it was most important to hold the swap network together. Mr. Mitchell commented that he thought the Committee had to keep the problems of this country in mind at all times. It was desirable to help other countries, but he was disturbed by the fact that such aid could contribute to gold outflow. There were limits to the capacity of the U. S. to assist foreign countries, particularly since it was far from clear that the balance of payments problem had been solved. Mr. Daane said that he appreciated the argument for symmetry with respect to the network of swap arrangements but in a case of need he did not think that symmetry was sacrosanct. In any case, the Italian drawings on the existing line probably would be repaid relatively soon out of IMF drawings or other borrowings. Mr. Balderston noted that the Italians had come to the assistance of the U. S. in the past. Chairman Martin commented that there appeared to be general agreement that adequate credit facilities should be provided, and credit made available as needed. The Committee would have to give continuing attention to the question of the methods to be employed in particular circumstances. This was a subject on which the Group of 10 might make recommendations. 3/24/64 -10- Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the Sys tem Open Market Account transactions in foreign currencies during the period March 3 through March 23, 1964, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. Mr. Coombs recommended renewal of five swap drawings maturing shortly: three with the Bank for International Settlements, for $35 million, maturing March 30; $50 million, maturing March 31; and $25 million maturing April 7; one with the Swiss National Bank, for $20 million, maturing March 31; and one with the Netherlands Bank, for $25 million, maturing April 2. Mr. Mitchell inquired whether these would be first renewals, and Mr. Coombs replied that two of the cases involved first renewals and three involved second renewals. No precedent would be established by the second renewals; last year, in fact, there had been some cases in which three renewals of a drawing had been made. Chairman Martin commented that the Committee\\'s practice had been to limit drawings to one year, but not to interpose objections to renewals within that period. Renewal of the five swap drawings, as proposed by Mr. Coombs, was noted without objection. Mr. Coombs recommended renewal of five reciprocal currency arrange ments, with the following banks, maturity dates, and amounts: the Bank of Sweden, maturing April 17, for $50 million; the Bank of Italy, maturing 3/24/64 -11- April 20, for $250 million; the Swiss National Bank, maturing April 20, for $150 million; the Bank for International Settlements, maturing April 20, for $150 million; and the Austrian National Bank, maturing April 24, for $50 million. All of these arrangements had been for a term of three months, with the exception of that with the Bank of Italy which was for six months, and the renewals would be for corresponding terms. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, renewal of the five swap arrange- ments, as recommended by Mr. Coombs, was approved. Mr. Coombs noted that the Committee had authorized various types of forward operations up to a combined total of $150 million. One of these types of forward operations was the purchase through spot transactions and sales through forward transactions of foreign currencies for the purpose of restraining short-term outflows of funds induced by arbitrage considerations. During the past three weeks, he said, such a risk of arbitrage had appeared in the case of Canada, where the forward Canadian dollar was in heavy demand as a result of a resumption of sizable Russian wheat purchases. While the System would have been prepared to undertake such operations for its own account, the Bank of Canada, for various technical reasons, preferred to conduct the operation itself. This had involved Bank of Canada sales of U. S. dollars spot and purchases forward with the result that a sizable although temporary reduction in the Bank 3/24/64 -12- of Canada\\'s reserves--perhaps as much as $75 million--had occurred. To smooth out this temporary distortion of their reserve position at the end of March, the Bank of Canada had asked the System to execute a month-end swap, i.e., buying Canadian dollars spot on March 31 and selling them forward for value on April 1. This was the type of operation, Mr. Coombs said, that the System would have conducted with the Market if it had been operating on its own account. He believed that it fell within the authorization granted by the Committee. However, since the operation had some unusual features, he thought he should bring it to the attention of the Committee. Chairman Martin asked Mr. Coombs whether he saw any dangers in this operation, and Mr. Coombs said he did not. The only question in his mind was whether the authorization in question was given a broad enough interpretation by the Committee to cover this type of operation. Mr. Swan asked for information on the technical reasons for which the Bank of Canada had preferred to conduct the operation itself. Mr. Coombs said that if the System had undertaken the operations, it would have bought Canadian dollars spot and sold them forward. With the Canadian dollars so acquired, the System could have picked up a relatively large part of the Canadian weekly bill tender, and if the operation was sizable this might have created a money market problem for the Canadians. On the other hand, their reserves were run down when they conducted the operations. Mr. Coombs thought a good compromise had been worked out, 3/24/64 -13- under which the Canadians operated during the month and the System took over their position temporarily at month end. Mr. Mitchell commented that the proposed operation seemed to him to come close to endorsing an objectionable type of window dressing. Central bank intervention in foreign exchange markets as well as in domestic markets always had dangers, and those dangers had been the subject of considerable discussion by the Committee when it initially undertook foreign exchange operations. Superficially, at least, an agency such as the System that had been concerned with window dressing activities of commercial banks might look silly if it endorsed window dressing by central banks. The operations Mr. Coombs proposed did seem to be innocuous, Mr. Mitchell said, but he felt that there was some obligation to permit what actually was going on to be revealed. Mr. Coombs said that the bulk of Canada\\'s forward operations were for one month, and the contracts would mature in early April. Thus, the reduction in Canadian reserves in March would be completely reversed in early April. He did not regard the proposed operation as window dressing, but rather as correcting an abnormality. The Canadian operations were to the benefit of the U. S. in restraining arbitrage outflows. It appeared to him that the most valid description was that this was a smoothing operation to eliminate a distortion. 3/24/64 -14- Mr. Robertson commented that he would have preferred to have had a memorandum explaining the proposal in advance of the meeting, and he would like to have an explanatory memorandum even if the Committee approved it. Mr. Coombs commented that no memorandum had been sent to the Committee in advance because the question had been raised quite recently, but he would have one prepared now. He added that an operation identical to this had been carried out last fall at the time of the Russian wheat purchases. The Bank of Canada had intervened in the market to minimize arbitrage flows from the U. S. to Canada, and at the month end the U. S. Treasury had taken over the position for a few days. It was shortly thereafter that he had requested authority to engage in forward operations for the purpose of restraining arbitrage flows. Mr. Deming said he had no objection to Mr. Coombs\\' suggestion. However, he wondered why the Canadians regarded publication of figures showing a $75 million reduction in reserves so seriously, particularly since they could explain the loss to the public just as Mr. Coombs had explained it to the Committee. Mr. Coombs replied that the Canadians were concerned because the figures in themselves affected attitudes even though there might be a valid explanation for them. Many people might react to the fact that there had been a reserve loss, and not bother to read published explanations. Chairman Martin suggested that the Committee approve the proposal with the understanding that a memorandum concerning operations of this type would be prepared. No objection to this suggestion was raised. 3/24/64 -15- Before this meeting there had been distributed to the members of the Committee a report from the Manager of the System Open Market Account covering open market operations in U. S. Government securities and bankers\\' acceptances for the period March 3 through March 18, 1964, and a supplemental report covering the period March 19 through March 23, 1964. Copies of these reports have been placed in the files of the Committee. In supplementation of the written reports, Mr. Stone commented as follows: System open market operations were relatively modest in size and frequency during the past three weeks. Movements in market factors tended to be mutually offsetting to a large extent and moderate System operations sufficed to maintain a generally firm money market through the period. Financial flows associated with the March tax and dividend dates were accommodated smoothly--which has been the typical experience with such periods in the recent past. There were day-to-day variations against the underlying steady background, however, in the course of which Federal funds temporarily traded as low as 2 per cent while daily member bank borrowings ran the gamut from $33 million to $953 million. Marginal reserve availability averaged lower than in the preceding several weeks, in good part reflecting retroactive revisions in the reserve estimates. Thus on Wednesday, March 13, it was projected that free reserves in the week ending that day would be about $135 million. While it was anticipated that revisions might pull the figure down to about $100 million, it now appears that unexpected movements in market factors and additional retroactive revisions resulted in a level as low as $7 million. A counterpart of the lower margin of free reserves has been the return of a larger excess of required reserves over the Board staff reference line. With money market conditions essentially steady and no particular pressures arising over the tax and dividend dates, Treasury bill rates continued to fluctuate in a comparatively narrow range. Rates edged lower through the first several days of the period, as the market gained confidence that England\\'s Bank rate increase would not be followed by an immediate discount 3/24/64 -16 rate increase in this country, and as the money market--despite somewhat lower free reserve figures--tended occasionally to the easy side of its recent range of variation. Bill rates were largely steady after March 9, although verging slightly higher at times as some increased firmness came into the money market in the second half of the period. The average issuing rates in yesterday\\'s bill auction--about 3.55 and 3.74 per cent for the 3- and 6-month issues, respectively--were each about 4 basis points under the rates three weeks ago. In contrast, the longer term securities markets generally moved lower in price and higher in rate during the period. While market participants in these sectors, too, expected no immediate tightening of domestic credit conditions, many observers felt that a change was probable some time within the next six months. The Treasury note and bond market was affected particularly by a desire of banks to trim their portfolios of short inter mediate maturities, in response to current and anticipated reserve needs. The market has also been affected by a desire of dealers to move into sizable short positions in the over-5 year maturity range--in part as a hedge against their long l-to-5 year positions. Over the period, prices of issues out to 5 years declined as much as 15/32, while most longer issues were down 1/2 to 3/4 point. Prices also softened in the corporate and tax exempt markets as investors hesitated to commit funds that they thought might be employed more profitably at a somewhat later date. In. the case of tax exempts, there is also the question of whether com mercial banks will remain as large buyers as they have been in the past year or two. Within the next day or two, the Treasury will have seen enough of its March tax receipts to decide whether it must borrow additional cash before mid-April, and if so, what amount and form that borrowing should take. The maximum contemplated need is $1.5 billion, although the actual need could turn out to be considerably less. Given the heavy tone in the bond market, it is anticipated that any such borrowing would be of short maturity, possibly in the bill area. Following this statement, Mr. Stone noted that the Committee had indicated at its last meeting that it wished to review its present Account allocation procedures. It was his understanding, he said, that the Board\\'s staff expected soon to complete a memorandum outlining a proposal 3/24/64 -17 that had been mentioned at the December 3, 1963 meeting of the Committee, under which securities rather than gold certificates would be used in the daily interdistrict settlement. If the Board agreed, the proposal would be sent for comment to the Presidents of the Reserve Banks. He thought it would be desirable for the Committee to defer its review of allocation procedures until the next meeting or the one following, because this proposal night have a considerable bearing on the matter. Mr. Mills suggested that the members of the Committee consider the proposal M::. Stone had mentioned very carefully, against the background of the debate that had taken place in the Congress during the past week. A majority of :he Joint Economic Committee, he noted, had advocated removal of the 25 per cent gold reserve against notes and deposits. The proposal had been vigorously protested by other members of the Congress, most importantly by Senator Robertson, Chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee. The Senator had brought out in his speech to the Congress the fact that there was a discipline to the gold reserve that should be maintained and that there was a formula to maintain that disci pline through a tax on deficient reserves. The Committee should corsider whether the proposal would run contrary to the reasoning of Senator Robertson and others and also whether it would run contrary to the statement the Board had made in a letter to Senator Douglas on November 5, 1963, regarding the 25 per cent gold certificate reserve requirement. In his judgment, these were considerations of great importance. 3/24/64 -18 Chairman Martin commented that he thought all members of the Committee should be alert to the points Mr. Mills had raised, and should study the problem carefully. Mr. Scanlon noted that on Thursday the Account had bought securities in the intermediate area, and asked what reasons lay behind the action. Mr. Stone replied that the Account had been out of the coupon market for some time--about four months--and it was important to keep the machinery in good working order. More generally, he thought it was the position of the Committee that the Desk should participate in the coupon markets in a marginal way, as it had in the past. It was his understanding that the Committee did not want to disengage from these markets. There had been a substantial availability of coupon issues in the market last week, as there had for some weeks, and the Desk had bought about $22 million. The size of the operation deliberately had been held down to avoid any implication that the purpose was to assist the Treasury. Mr. Mitchell observed that the market seemed to have come to the conclusion that the System had retreated from operations in longer term securities. Mr. Stone said there were some participants in the market who were vigorously opposed to such operations, and who would like to see their demise. But he did not think the market generally was of the opinion that the System had reverted to a \"bills only\" policy. However, it had not been possible to operate in coupon issues for some time. The Treasury\\'s advance refunding blocked out most of January, and the 3/24/64 -19 February refunding was in process until the 15th of that month, or a few days thereafter. Then the British Bank rate was increased, and Treasury bill rates rose. At the time of the Committee\\'s last meeting the 3-month bill rate was about 10 basis points above the discount rate, and for that reason he thought it important to supply any necessary reserves through operations in bills. Since the last meeting the Account had had little occasion to supply reserves, and it took the opportunity to buy coupon issues on Thursday. Mr. Hayes commented that January and February was a seasonally low period for System purchases. For example, the System had supplied somewhat over $1-1/2 billion in reserves during 1963, but of this total only about $30 million were supplied in the first two months of the year. Mr. Stone added that these were months in which the Treasury typically was active in the market. Mr. Mitchell said he would like to get the Desk\\'s interpretation of the Committee\\'s intent on operations in ccupon issues, and asked whether Mr. Stone felt any inhibitions about operating in such issues. Mr. Stone replied that he did not. As he conceived it, the Committee\\'s policy was that the Desk should participate in the intermediate and longer term sector with operations of the same general character as those that had been undertaken over the period since the Committee had authorized such operations. The essence of this character was that operations in coupon issues should be marginal with respect to the total volume of 3/24/64 -20 activity in that area of the market, in order to minimize direct price effects. This meant confining purchases to periods when there was a substantial volume of securities available in the market. He had no inhibitions abcut operations within this framework. Mr. Mitchell then noted that the Desk operated in the bill area with rate objectives in mind, and asked if Mr. Stone felt that the Committee had given him authority to operate in longer term markets with similar objectives, particularly in view of the Chairman\\'s statement at the previous meeting on operations in these markets. Mr. Stcne said he did not think that the Committee intended the Desk to attempt. to fix prices of longer term securities. However, he would feel no compunction about buying coupon issues when there was a need to supply reserves, as long as the operations were within the frame work he had just described. Over the next two or three weeks, for example, the Account would have to supply a substantial volume of reserves, and he would contemplate doing part of the job in the coupon area, insofar as such operations would not interfere with the Treasury financing. That would be in keeping with his interprettion of the Committee\\'s intent. In effect, then, Mr. Mitchell said, the Desk would operate in the coupon area to protect the short-term rate, but not to pull down the longer term rate. Mr. Stone replied that he would not want to stand in the way of a price adjustment that reflected a reassessment of conditions by the market and a new consensus about the outlook for security prices. 3/24/64 -21- Mr. Robertson said that in his judgment it was unfortunate that the Desk had moved out of the short-term area in the absence of any obvious, worthwhile purpose. He did not think any purpose had been served by last week\\'s operation except to show the Committee\\'s hand. Such operation; could confuse the market with respect to the Committee\\'s objectives, and could make participants wary. They also tended to preclude the market from giving the Committee the kinds of signals that would be received if the market was as close to free as possible. Although the policy of the Committee was to operate in all maturities, he thought coupon operations should be confined to periods when they would serve some real purpose. Mr. Hayes said that in his judgment the quality of the signals from the market was preserved when the Manager operated in the coupon area with such caution and in such a small way. He felt it was important to let the market know that the Committee was prepared to operate in the longer term area. There was danger in encouraging the kind of rumor that was going around to the effect that the System was permanently out of the coupon area, because when operations in this area became necessary they might tend to disrupt the market. It was better, in his judgment, for the market to view System operations in coupon issues as a normal thing. Chairman Martin remarked that there had been some discussion of this subject at a recent Board meeting, and the suggestion had been 3/24/64 -22 made that longer term operations should be undertaken more frequently, to prevent rumors that they had been discontinued. He thought Mr. Robertson\\'s point was good that such operations should not be engaged in for their own sake. But a better over-all picture might result if they were undertaken whenever an opportunity to operate marginally presented itself, and more frequently than every three or four months. His comment, the Chairman noted, was directed to the future and not to the past. Mr. Mills said he might point out that the Chairman\\'s statement represented the sense of the thinking of some members of the Board, but it was not a unanimous view. Chairman Martin added that Board members unquestionably were divided on the subject. Mr. Swan said he had been rather surprised that free reserves could fall as low as they had in the past two weeks without greater effect on the feel and tone of the market. Was it the case that the market had not reacted more strongly to the lower free reserve figures because they made the same misses in their estimates as the Desk had; or had there been some more basic change in the total picture; or, as he suspected, did it reflect the fact that at this point the short-term area seemed more attractive to investors than the intermediate and longer term area did, in view of their expectations for security prices? Mr. Stone said he thought it was true that some of the recent demand for short-term securities involved funds that later would move 3/24/64 -23 into intermediate and longer term areas, as he had suggested in his state ment. In his judgment, however, the basic reason for the relative steadiness of the money market recently was that participants had by no means concluded from the lower free reserve figures that monetary policy had changed--despite the fact that one journalist had made a statement to that effect. People in the market fully understood that free reserve figures fluctuated, and that the center of the range recently had been about $100 million, with the weekly figures sometimes above and sometimes below this level. However, given changes in the rate of reserve utilization, it was perfectly possible to have the same tone and feel with free reserves at $175 million at one time and at $35 million at another. Mr. Swan asked whether the tone and feel at the present lower level of free reserves were the same as earlier. Mr. Stone replied that the Desk did not have enough perspective on the matter as yet, but might be able to tell in the next week or two whether there had been any fundamental change. Mr. Wayne commented that he had been on the daily call for the past three weeks, and throughout the period he had been disturbed, and the Account Management had been disturbed, by the misses in reserve projections. Journalists had to discuss something, and the only figures that fluctuated much were those for free reserves, so they wrote about them. He thought the Desk and the System were in a somewhat embarrassing position because the free reserve figures were not reliable and it was 3/24/64 -24 hard to improve them. The Desk had to make its decisions each day on the basis of the feel of the market that day; and then, a week later, it discovered that the data were being revised downward. Later revisions in figures tended to creep into the market thinking. He would hope that some means for improving the figures could be found, but he personally did not have the answer. In response to a question from Mr. Daane, Mr. Stone said that it obviously would be necessary to supply reserves over the coming statement week, since the Desk\\'s projections indicated net borrowed reserves of $142 million. He would expect to begin putting reserves in today or tomorrow. Mr. Daane said it seemed to him to be particularly important that the Desk get a running start in supplying reserves. This was the eve of a Treasury refinancing, and it would be unfortunate to seem to confirm the recent low free reserve figures with another low figure. A figure on the high side would be all to the good. Mr. Wayne said that he agreed; any error this week should be on the high rather than the low side. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities and bankers\\' acceptances during the period March 3 through March 23, 1964, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. 3/24/64 -25- Chairman Martin then called for the staff economic and financial reports, supplementing the written reports that had been distributed prior to the meeting, copies of which have been placed in the files of the Committee. Mr. Brill commented on economic conditions as follows: The silly season seems to have started for economists a little before the rest of the country. Clutching at tax-cut straws is a major preoccupation of the profession these days, with each retail trade figure scrutinized for evidence that the increase in take-home pay is being taken to the local auto or appliance dealer, and each announced corporate spending plan evaluated against pretax-cut surveys. The plain fact is that we know almost nothing yet about the specific impact of the cut. The first week and a half of aggregate data on post-tax cut retail sales show continued strength--at about the February record levels--but these weekly data have in the past been erratic, and in other years the high level of sales might as easily have been attributed to an early Easter. Auto sales have continued exceptionally strong, but production has been more than adequate and dealer inventories have been increased to desired levels. As a result, production schedules for the balance of this month and next have been reduced. The latest output and employment data available predate the tax cut. They show a small rise--half of one per cent--in the industrial production index from January to February, con tinued growth in employment and the labor force, and a drop of 2/10 of one per cent in the unemployment rate. The recent upping in business capital spending plans also antedates--even though it may have anticipated--the tax cut. It is encouraging that businessmen plan a resumption of increased spending after the winter plateau, but the rise now expected in the second half of this year is neither as much nor as rapid as was the rise from the first to the second half of 1963. Thus, all we can conclude at the moment is that the economy was enjoying continued moderate upward momentum and that expectations were high at the time the tax cut became effective; and that the situation calls for more \"watchful waiting.\" Among the areas we are watching closely, of course, is that of prices, and in this we have lots of company, with Administra tion economists sharing the concern. Administration concern, however, as evidenced in the official statements and staff 3/24/64 -26- analyses we have seen, seems to focus too narrowly on the dangers of cost-push inflation, particularly on the possibility of excessive wage settlements in key industries, and gives too little recognition to other factors which can prove just as upsetting of price stability. Moreover, it puts perhaps too much reliance on the excess of available production facilities and manpower over prospective aggregate demands. Projections of the economy for 1964, as presented in the Budget and Economic Message, imply that the growth in activity will be gradual and will still leave relatively large margins of unused industrial capacity and labor by year end. Along with rising profit margins, these would serve to limit the likelihood of price increases. This argument is plausible, particularly since it seems to have worked in 1962 and 1963. Some reservations are in order, however. The progress of the economy may not be as smooth as projected--it rarely is--and a bunching of demand, particularly in conjunction with rising activity abroad, could result in price pressures for a variety of industrial materials, such as we have already seen in the nonferrous metals area. There are other industries, notably paper and textiles, in which output is already high relative to capacity. One might also legitimately express some concern over the relatively low level of producers\\' stocks, which to date have been regarded as evidence of business moderation. Caution in inventory policy has indeed contributed to the fairly stable expansion so far; manufacturers\\' inventories are unusually low for so late a period in a cyclical expansion. A surge in final demands, however, could easily precipitate a bunching of orders and a \"hurry up and deliver\" atmosphere that has in the past been conducive to price boosts. On the cost side, one can hope that the recent pace of productivity gains in manufacturing will continue, and will offset the wage increases likely to follow robust profits reports. Business emphasis on plant modernization will work in this direction. Short-run developments in productivity, however, tend to be unpredictable. Moreover, productivity increases in manufacturing may not curb labor costs in the trade, service, and construction areas, where wage increases in recent years have probably been higher, proportionately, than in manufacturing. With prices firming and consumer demands for services strong, continued wage gains in the services and distribution sectors could push the consumer price index up somewhat faster than recently, triggering other wage demands. 3/24/64 -27 The future is obviously fraught with more dangers than just that of an excessive wage settlement in the auto industry. These potential dangers cannot be translated into present inflation, however. Despite stirring in a few areas and the usual \"scare\" stories in the press, stability in over-all price measures is still being maintained. The industrial price average is up only one half of one per cent from a year ago and is no higher than the recession-trough level. Similarly, wholesale prices of foods and foodstuffs show no net change over the past three years. On the labor cost front, recent wage settlements continue moderate, conforming to the pattern of gains That has prevailed over the past several years, well within the framework of industrial productivity increases. The wajor trouble spot recently has been in the cyclically volatile prices of nonferrous metals and products, which have responded to the high level of demand here and abroad. Some of the pressure in these markets could be offset by further Government actions. Recent sales from the stockpile took most of the steam out of the tin market. For lead and zinc, stock pile holdings are very large. While these surpluses cannot be sold without legislative authorization, import quotas could be altered or removed by proclamation of the President after hearings and a recommendation by the Tariff Commission. Such hearings have been scheduled for late June. In summary, prices and costs are still continuing the remarkable and desirable stability that has characterized the economic expansion to date. There is at least a fighting chance that this stability can be maintained, if the expansion continues orderly and if the Administration is willing to couple hard actions, where it has the discretion, with open mouth policy. Current data do not suggest the need for other measures of restraint, at least not until there is more evidence that the cost and price situation is changing. Mr. Holand made the following statement concerning monetary and credit developments: As Mr. Stone has indicated, short-term financial markets took the March tax pressures very much in stride, even though a larger amount of corporate payments had to be accommodated. Partly reflecting these larger flows, bank credit expanded considerably more than usual over the first three weeks in March. In fact, this represented the first more-than-seasonal increase in bank reserve use in almost two months, and raised the average annual rate of expansion since last July to 3.5 per 3/24/64 -28- cent in reserves required against private demand deposits and 15.5 per cent in required reserves against time deposits. Tax and dividend date developments did not seem to suggest that any important fraction of American businesses was beginning to feel the pressure of needs for funds. Business loans at city banks rose less than last year (even after allowance for a special public utility term loan repayment this year) despite larger corporate tax liabilities. The major asset expansion at banks came in credit to dealers and finance companies and in holdings of Treasury bills, as corporations made tax payments by drawing down their holdings of these kinds of paper. Corporations also liquidated some of their CDs, not only those purchased from American banks but possibly also some bought from Canadian banks. Yet, while businesses held over a third of a billion dollars of negotiable CDs maturing at major New York City and Chicago banks on the tax and dividend dates alone, these banks managed to find new buyers for almost an equivalent amount of new CDs by temporarily sweetening the rates which they were willing to pay. The end result can be taken as evidence that corporations as a whole are still in a comfortable liquidity position; and the comments just made by Mr. Brill concerning their large cash inflows, relatively low inventories, and moderate increases in capital outlays help to explain why. Data from the consumer sector, however, appear to be telling u.s a somewhat different story. Personal-type interest bearing liquid asset holdings, while still growing, have been increasing at a distinctly slower rate than last year. On the other hand, we do not know how much of the recent moderate money supply expansion has moved into consumer hands, although there are no signs that they received a disproportionate share. Considering that all this took place while personal income was continuing to advance to new .ighs, the inference is that individuals have been diverting an appreciably larger propor tion of their resources into either less liquid financial assets or into purchases of goods and services. But exactly where such flows may be going is hard to divine. The stock market has been strong, and trading volume very substantial, but the classic signs of greater small-investor participation are still lacking. The tax-exempt market has experienced greater investor demand than many expected this year, but this can be largely accounted for by a brief resurgence of commercial bank buying. Consumer purchases of autos have been strong for some time, and takings of furniture and appliances have stepped up recently, but the timing and the dimensions of 3/24/64 -29- these changes are not such as to be attributable to reduced liquid asset acquisitions with any degree of certainty. As you can judge, the precise shift that has taken place in consumer asset allocation is still unclear. Nonetheless, whether the slackened accumulation of personal liquidity has reflected a shift in favor of less liquid financial assets, real investment, or consumption, its effect on the economic environment is likely to have been salutary--and to continue to be so, as long as the movement is a moderate one. Bank liquidity, meanwhile, has been bolstered a bit by some fairly aggressive banker sales of intermediate-term Governments and purchases of bills during March. Partly, this may be a reaction to loan-deposit ratios that have been inching higher; partly, it may be an adjustment to previous portfolio lengthening in January and February through takings of tax-exempts and participations in Treasury financings; and partly it reflects precautionary action in anticipation of future loan demand and interest rate increases. The dimensions of these adjustments have not been large enough to dull significantly the responsiveness of banks to any change in Federal Reserve policy; but they have been enough to shake the confidence of the intermediate-term Government securities market. Dealers, feeling equally uneasy, have also been unloading Governments of intermediate and longer term. The consequence has been a back-up of yields on most Government securities beyond the short-term maturity area to new high levels for this expansion. The Treasury is faced with an unerviable task in raising about $1.5 billion cash in this market. Even if that financing, when announced, is held to a short-term instrument, a particularly careful \"even keel\" in monetary policy seems to be called for until the next meeting of the Committee. It is fortunate, in this context, that the circumstances of the last few weeks seem to have conditioned the money market to accept a slightly greater range of short-run fluctuations with some equanimity. This is more a matter of changed attitude than of altered experience. Three-month bill rates, for example, have moved within a range of 7 basis points since the British Bank rate increase; this compares with a range of 5 basis points that prevailed in each of the earlier months. Nonetheless, market participants seem to have come to accept the fact that there is a little wider range within which their own pricing and trading judgments can hold sway. This, it seems to me, is all to the good. The gain thus far, however, 3/24/64 -30- is a modest one. As has already been discussed, the low free reserve figures that eventuated in the past two weeks have given rise to comment, even though money market conditions have remained essentially stable. My own impression accords with Mr. Swan\\'s, that the money market has been cushioned from the slight decrease in reserve availability because of the inflow of money seeking to go short as an interest rate hedge. As a result, any efforts to move marginal reserve availability back closer to the averages of the earlier weeks this year might have to involve slightly lower money market rates. That might in fact be a reasonable development to allow for a time, for it would represent a natural way for short rates to respond to the current bank shift toward more liquid instruments. Mr. Furth commented on the balance of payments as follows: The United States has made unexpectedly rapid progress towards eliminating its international deficit. In January, the deficit was still at an annual rate of about $1-3/4 billion, close to the level recorded in the second half of 1963. In February, the deficit was greatly reduced. And the tentative figures for the first three weeks of March suggest a considerable surplus for this period, large enough to permit some hope that the first quarter as a whole may, for the first time since 1957, show virtual equilibrium, even after adjustments for extraordinary receipts and for seasonal factors. Needless to say, even if the last two weeks of March do not show renewed deterioration and the final figures confirm the preliminary data, this would not necessarily mean that the U. S. payments problem has been solved for good. International conditions in the present quarter may well turn out to have been abnormally favorable for the U. S. payments position. First, economic expansion in many countries that are among our best customers may have proceeded at an unsustainable pace. The leading nations of Continental Europe are willing and able to take effective action to correct a trade deficit--although a curious mixture of mercantilistic and laissez-faire ideology, coupled with institutional rigidities and reluctance or perhaps incapacity to use the full potentialities of modern fiscal and monetary policy instruments, makes the less apt to correct an excessive trade surplus. Hence, France, Switzerland, and Italy, as well as Japan, have taken anti-inflationary measures to reduce their trade deficits. After a lag, these actions may be expected to curb U. S. exports not only to those countries 3/24/64 -31- themselves but also in third markets in which U. S. goods compete with Japanese and European products. In contrast, Germany had so far done nothing to reduce its trade surplus except excoriate its neighbors for overimporting German goods. Second, recent months have seen considerable flows of funds out of countries whose currencies were under attack: to a modest degree out of Britain before the rise in British Bank rate; and in far greater volume out of Italy until the recent announcement of the stabilization credit \"package.\" While there are no reports about substantial flows of funds from those two countries to the United States, it would be sur prising indeed if the reserve losses of those countries, which amounced to $230 million in February and $200 million in the first half of March, had benefitted exclusively other European countries. It seems reasonable to assume that some funds have moved to the United States, including U. S. funds previously held abroad. British and Italian reserve losses have now apparently ceased; and this may well mean the cessation of some reflux to the United States. Something similar happened after the Canadian stabilization in 1962; and while U. S. money markets have, of course, much closer relations with Canada than with Italy or even Britain, the 1962 experience should be a warning against complacency. Nevertheless, the psycholog.cal consequence of a quarter without a substantial U. S. payments deficit might well be even greater than its purely financial significance. The improvement would come at a time when the discussions within the Group of Ten on the future of the international payments system are reaching a critical stage. The Group will soon have to decide whether it will unambiguously endorse further organic evolution of the present system, based on the predominant role of the dollar as a means of international settlements and as a reserve asset; or whether it will lean toward a replacement of that system in accordance with one or the other of recent proposals that: would aim either at restoring some kind of gold standard or at creating some kind of international reserve unit; or whether it will try to skirt these vital issues and thereby risk contributing to continued uncertainty in the international financial community, and in exchange and gold markets, about the future of the payments system. Convincing evidence of progress towards U. S. payments equilibrium would obviously give strong support to the first type of solution. And the recent U. S. initiative in helping Italy to overcome its payments difficulties has apparently already had a similar effect. A few days age, a French 3/24/64 -32- financial newspaper, which is believed to have close relations to some government circles, bitterly attacked that initiative, complaining that the Italian stabilization program indicated a \"belief that the tide has turned for the dollar and that the golden days of French finance are over;\" and that it might be regarded as \"proof . . . that the European solidarity is fiction and that in serious matters the only real power is the United States and its currency, the dollar.\" The French Covernment has denied that these views reflect its official position. Nevertheless, the newspaper\\'s statement may well be close to the truth. Chairman Martin then called for the usual go-around of comments and views on economic conditions and monetary policy beginning with Mr. Hayes, who commented as follows: The business outlook seems to have strengthened further in the past three weeks. A key factor in this improvement has been the growing evidence, both in the new Commerce-SEC survey, and in a number of announcements by individual companies, that business expenditures on plant and equipment will increase much faster this year than in 1963. It is too early, however, to predict that this will develop into a real boom. Most sectors of the economy look rather strong, including residential construction. Of course the major uncertainty lies in the area of consumer reactions to the tax cut, and the resulting impact on spending and prices. While the major price indices continue to show stability, there has been a new flurry of increases, notably in metal prices, in the last couple of weeks. With business expansion likely to accelerate in the coming months, and with the threat of excessively generous wage settlements facing us this summer, it behooves the System to remain very much on the alert for signs of new inflationary pressures. In this connection we can welcome the President\\'s strong plea yesterday for wage and price restraint; but it remains to be seen how effective this will be. The latest balance of payments figures are decidedly encouraging. Payments were virtually in balance in February and were actually in surplus in early March. A remarkably strong trade surplus seems to have been a major contributor to the improvement of recent months--and while part of this is attributable to temporary agricultural export gains re flecting European crop shortages, a larger part seems due to 3/24/64 -33 the rapid rise in living standards in many industrialized countries and our improved competitive position vis-a-vis Europe. I also have the impression that, although bank lending to foreigners remains relatively large, there has been a tendency, at least early in the year, for U. S. corporations to pull short-term investments back to this country in response to the better yields obtainable here than some months before. It is interesting to note that the approximate over-all payments balance in February was achieved in spite of a sudden but not wholly unexpected revival of long-term foreign issues in our markets in that month to a level about equal to the 1962 monthly average. Despite the improvement in balance of payments statistics, I think that caution and avoidance of overoptimism are very much in order. If business expands as now seems likely, imports should receive a strong stimulus. Also, the volume of foreign security flotations is likely to be substantial, whether or not the interest equalization tax is enacted; and we cannot overlook the possibility that tighter credit and higher interest rates abroad may eventually revive undesirable developments in the area of short-term capital flows. There have been unusually large divergencies in the movements of such financial statistics as those on total bank credit and money supply that have become available since our last meeting. Careful analysis suggests to me, however, that these divergencies can be explained in good part by questionable seasonal adjustments, by erratic movements in Government deposits, and by the fact that some series deal with daily averages and others with month-end data. Allowing for such factors, I believe that so far the underlying trends of bank credit, loan demand, and money supply have shown no marked change since 1963. There appears to be some uncertainty as to the amount of the Treasury\\'s prospective cash borrowing early in April, and ever as to whether it will occur at all. If it is felt that the amount needed can be satisfied in the bill market, the \"even keel\" implications of the financing would be quite limited. In any case, however, neither domestic nor international con siderations point to the need at this time for any change in monetary policy. Basically it seems to me that we should continue to accommodate moderate growth in bank reserves and bank credit, while maintaining the present degree of firmness in the money market. Looking a little further ahead, if expanding business demands for credit together with the prospect of heavier Treasury borrowing after midyear should bring 3/24/64 -34- pressures for accelerated credit growth, we should permit this to be reflected in some upward movement in interest rates. In maintaining the status quo over the coming three weeks we might reasonably aim at free reserves in the $0-$150 million range, which should mean borrowing of $350 to $400 million; Federal funds consistently at 3-1/2 per cent; and a three-month bill rate moving within or close to the 3.50-3.60 range. Incidentally, I have read with interest the Manager\\'s memorandum commenting on the second paragraph in the directive and the absence of serious difficulties arising from conflicts within the directive. While I am sure we would all like to find some currently available indicator that would enable us to adjust operations more closely to long-run objec tives in terms of aggregate reserves or total bank credit, I am convinced that until better data are available we would do well to couch the directive in roughly such terms as are now in use. If the Committee agrees on the desirability of maintaining policy unchanged for the next three weeks, renewal of the present directive would seem appropriate, with some modification of the first paragraph in recognition of the further improvement in the balance of payments. Mr. Ellis reported that: factory employment in New England was not expanding, but that manufacturers\\' new orders were rising. Reports in the regional survey of manufacturers\\' investment plans were continuing to be received, and the latest tabulations not only confirmed the earlier indications of a rise in capital expenditures but showed a larger rise than the earlier tabulations had. The present estimate was that New England manufacturers were reporting a year-to-year increase in capital outlays of 37 per cent. Because this figure was so high a check had been made on the accuracy of the survey in previous years. Respondents in the survey generally account for more than 30 per cent of 3/24/64 -35 the region\\'s manufacturing employment, and over the past seven years the estimate based on the survey had proved to be accurate within a 10 per cent margin. At least in New England, the tax cut evidently was having a stimulating effect on capital outlays. Nationally, Mr. Ellis said, the expansion was continuing, and the role of credit in this expansion was revealed in such figures as the 7 or 8 per cent rate of growth in bank loans and investments, the 4 per cent growth rate in the money supply, and the 15 per cent rate of increase in time deposits. As the staff memorandum reported in discussing the balance of payments, the latest data available indicated that the outflow of commercial bank credit had remained heavy. Also, for the first two weeks of March at New York City banks the increase in total loans and investments was unusually large, exceeding the increases in three of the past four years by $650 million or more. To his mind, the fundamental question the Committee faced was how rapidly and for how long it could continue to support the current rate of credit expansion. His own view was that the present rate was unsustainable for the longer run, and that the Committee should seek to curtail it. The closeness of the Treasury financing prospectively, and the closeness of the tax cut retrospectively, suggested no change in policy at this meeting. However, he would favor resolving uncertainties on the side of less ease. Mr. Ellis felt that the Committee should clarify its instructions on this point. It was the Manager\\'s understanding that net borrowed 3/24/64 -36 reserves should be avoided unless the Committee shifted its policy toward less ease. He thought the Committee should revise its instructions by expressing a willingness to accept an occasional negative free reserve figure and by indicating that a figure in the range from minus $50 million to plus $200 million was consistent with its objectives. The discussion at the last meeting, Mr. Ellis continued, indi cated that the Committee was concerned about the narrow range of fluctuation in the bill rate. He had found Mr. Stone\\'s explanation of the lack of fluctuation to be persuasive. At the same time, the Committee certainly had succeeded in c.onveying to the market its disin clination to let short rates fall below 3.5) per cent, or to let them rise enough to threaten the Regulation Q ceilings. He questioned whether the Committee logically could continue to be concerned about the lack of fluctuations in short rates, in view of the fact that its own defensive actions defeated the objective of wider fluctuation. While he urged the Committee to accept a larger range of fluctuation in free reserves, it wasn\\'t his intention to argue for fewer defensive operations. Rather, his objective was to overcome, on a gradual basis, the block posed by market expectations associated with crossing the zero free reserve level. Unless this barrier was overcome, the Committee could not have a continuous policy, but always would be faced with discon tinuous changes. 3/24/64 -37 With respect to the directive, Mr. Ellis continued, a sentence in the policy record entry for the meeting held on December 19, 1961, read: \"In the view of the majority, separation of the continuing authorizations from the current directive would permit the Committee to frame its current economic policy instructions to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in a more effective fashion.\" During 1962 the Committee had changed the first paragraph of the directive nine times. In 1963 it had revised this paragraph six times, often very slightly. What interested him was that the first paragraph of the directive had been left unchanged from July 1963 until the last meeting, except for a rearrangement of words in October. Obviously, there was no merit in changing the directive merely for the sake of change, but it was doubtful that the Committee was ex pressing its objectives carefully enough if a single paragraph could fairly express policy objectives covering the eight-month span from August 1963 to March 1964. In a concluding remark, Mr. Ellis noted that the staff had circu lated alternative proposals for wording the directive near the end ,f the last meeting. Except for one Reserve Bank President, none of the participants in the ensuing discussion had seen the proposals before they were distributed. He would urge that proposals for alternative directive wordings be distributed to the full Committee at the start of the meeting, so that everyone might have an opportunity to study them and to comment on them in the course of the go-around. 3/24/64 -38 Mr. Irons reported that conditions in the Eleventh District were favorable. Changes had been relatively slight recently, and for the most part involved an edging up. The production index for the District had risen fractionally, in about the same manner as the national index bad. Crude oil production and refining were up a bit, although prices were on the weak side at the moment. Construction contract awards continued to advance, with the increase attributable to residential building; nonresidential construction was slightly lower. Nonagricultural employ ment was moving about seasonally, and department store sales had reached record highs. The demand for new automobiles was strong. Agricultural conditions generally were good; there had been quite a bit of rain scattered around the District. On the whole, business conditions were showing a moderate, slight expansion and there were no signs of surges in the picture. In the financial area, Mr. Irons said, bank loans and investments and deposits had moved upward during the past three weeks, with the increases slightly less than for the comparable period a year ago. The loan increase was general except for consumer loans, which were off a little. Increases in investments were about the same as a year earlier, but holdings of Governments were down and those of other types of invest ments were up. District banks still were net buyers of Federal funds, but their purchases were running somewhat below earlier levels. Borrowings at the Reserve Bank had risen, but not significantly. 3/24/64 -39 Mr. Irons commented that during the past week or two he had noticed less in the way of extremes in the attitudes of businessmen. It seemed that the thinking of most was following a standard pattern; conditions were considered good and further advances were anticipated. Few expected the economy to go through the roof, and few expected a lack of stable advance. There was surprisingly little comment on the effects of the tax cut; this seemed to rank much lower in the scale of things discussed than the international situation. It was taken for granted that the domestic economy was going to move ahead at a reasonable, moderate pace. Perhaps this was complacency. In any case, people thought that there was not much to worry about. With respect to the directive, Mr. Irons said he did not advocate a change. Mr. Swan reported that the limited information available for February and early March suggested a continuation of the modest but broadly-based advance in the Twelfth District. Preliminary figures indicated an increase in February in total employment in California, with declines in manufacturing more than offset by gains in other sectors. The reduction in manufacturing employment resulted from a further decline in defense- and space-related industries, particularly in electrical manufacturing. In fact, the February decline in defense related employment was the largest for any single month since April 1963. There also was a further drop in aircraft employment in the State of Washington. 3/24/64 -40- Mr. Swan noted that construction activity in the District continued at the high level of the second half of 1963. Demand for nonferrous metals remained strong, while that: for structural steel was fairly active because of the mild winter weather in the District. Loans at weekly reporting banks declined slightly in the three weeks ending March 11, in contrast with increases for the rest of the nation. But for 1964 to date the situation was reversed; loans rose in the District and declined in the rest of the nation. With respect to policy, Mr. Swan said he would not advocate any tightening now even apart from the possibility of a Treasury financing, which called for an even keel. There seemed to be no indications of a rise in the rate of expansion in business activity. Certainly tightening was not called for by the recent developments in the balance of payments. The increases in bank reserves and in the money supply thus far in 1964 had been modest. Of course, money and reserves had increased rapidly in the latter part of 1963, but the rises had occurred without significant pressures on prices or reductions in unutilized resources. He agreed that some tightening might be required before disappearance of the slack was clearly evident in the statistics, but he did not see the need for tightening at this point. Mr. Swan said he would favor a continued moderate increase in the supply of bank reserves. Also he would like to see the free reserve figure at or above $100 million, if possible, not only because of possible 3/24/64 -41 market reactions to lower figures but also because he believed that the money market would have been considerably firmer recently had it not been for the slight shift of attitude with respect to intermediate and longer term securities. He would resolve doubts or the side of ease. As far as the directive was concerned, Mr. Swan said, he agreed with Mr. Hayes that the first paragraph should be changed to reflect the further improvement in the balance of payments. Some reference to possible Treasury financing also would be desirable, even though specific financing plans had not yet been formulated. Mr. Deming reported that the Minneapolis Bank\\'s mid-March business opinion survey indicated some swing toward optimism, particularly as com pared with the January and February surveys, Survey respondents had been asked if they felt the tax cut would stimulate business activiry in their local areas. In the commercial areas, where salaries and wages were significant, the tax cut was seen as definitely stimulative. In the rural areas people thought tax cut stimulation of business activity would be slower to be realized. With the exception of farm incomes, Ninth District current busi ness indicators in recent weeks had moved moderately upward, Mr. Deming said. Retail sales were especially good in February and early March. February and March employment increases over year-earlier figures were gratifying. Bank debits were up sharply, and the industrial use of 3/24/64 -42 electric power advanced substantially from January to February. Personal incomes in the District also increesed again in February despite declining farm incomes. District bank deposits increased a little more than average during the first half of March. Loan demand seemed to be picking up after some relative weakness earlier in the year although demand for commercial and industrial loans continued relatively light. Mr. Deming said that for the reasons already cited, he would favor no change in policy and no change in the discount rate. He would echo the comment that changes in the first paragraph of the directive were desirable to reflect the Treasury financing and to take account of the change in the balance of payments situation. It appeared from what Mr. Furth had said that the present language with respect to an adverse payments balance might no longer be accurate. He would favor continuing the phrase \"maintaining about the same conditions in the money market as have prevailed in recent weeks,\" but he had a little difficulty in defining the phrase. He thought it would be a mistake to let free reserves become negative, and would prefer to see them somewhat higher than they had been in the past three weeks--perhaps around $100 million. But he was not sure this could be accomplished while maintaining the con ditions in the money market that had prevailed in recent weeks. He would hope that both objectives could be achieved. 3/24/64 -43 Mr. Scanlon reported that economic expansion continued in the Seventh District. In manufacturing stronger demand was most evident in steel, motor vehicles, and machinery and equipment. A recent meeting of business economists held at the Reserve Bank revealed widespread optimism. Auto and truck sales were excellent in February. Demand for machinery had been very good in early 1964, with orders for construction equipment showing exceptional strength. Shipments of farm machinery also had increased despite reduced farm income in some sectors. Airline traffic in the first two months of 1964 was 20 per cent above last year, and well above projections. Telephones added in Illinois in January and February numbe:ed 30 per cent more than last year, while total toll calls were 9 per cent higher. A large retailer reported sales running well above budgeted levels. Nevertheless, inventories were in good balance and prices had changed little as suppliers were able to ship goods promptly. Many of the firms represented at the meeting had raised their capital expenditure plans for 1964 and 1965. Mr. Scanlon said that bank debits at District banks had been at a high plateau in recent months, with the totals for January and February almost 14 per cent above last year. Savings deposits increased only half as much in the first two months as in the same period last year. When savings were combined with individuals\\' holdings of time certificates, however, the percentage increase about matched last year. The percentage rise in savings and loan association share accounts in February was 3/24/64 -44 slightly below the same month of last year, reflecting an improvement over January, when the net inflow was only a fraction of the rise a year earlier. Thus, savings in these forms were still rising rapidly. Steel output, now at an annual rate of about 120 million tons, was expected to rise further in March, April, and May, Mr. Scanlon said. In the latter part of this period auto demand was expected to decline in preparation for early model changeovers in July. Some steel users were believed to be building inventories, and delivery schedules had been stretching out in recent weeks--particularly in the case of cold-rolled and galvanized sheet, wide plates, and wide-flange beams. Mr. Scanlon reported that during the first three weeks of the sign-up under the Feed Grain Program (February 10-27) farmers agreed to divert 78 per cent more acreage than in the same period of last year. Decisions had been influenced by dry weather, low livestock prices, and changes in the program. Apparently farmers would plant somewhat less acreage in corn than last year. On the other hand, soybean acreage was expected to be expanded. Commercial and industrial loans at Chicago banks increased sharply last week, Mr. Scanlon noted, but for the six weeks ending mid-March the increase was the smallest of any recent year. While business loans at Chicago banks rose somewhat more over the tax date than a year ago, the amount of maturing tax bills was smaller. 3/24/64 -45 In preparation for the April 1 tax assessment date, Chicago banks had acquired more than $250 million of Treasury bills in the past two weeks--mostly with April 2 maturities. Total bill inventories were now a little less than last year\\'s March peak but above most other recent years. The two largest banks would need about $600 million, all of which has been arranged. Some of the recently acquired bills were out on RP\\'s. About $200 million of these were April 2 bills and a substantial portion of the remainder was represented by other April maturities so there should be no difficulty in unwinding the transactions. The net decline in negotiable certificates of deposit over the mid-March tax date had amounted to about $60 m:llion and another $50 million would mature at the end of the month. Mr. Scanlon said he would favor continuation of the current policy. He would make no change in the directive other than to reflect the improve ment in the balance of payments. He did not favor changing the discount rate. Mr. Clay said that cash receipts from farm marketings in the Tenth District were continuing the decline that began in 1963. This reflected a lower level of receipts from the sale of both grains and meat animals. The current condition of the 1964 wheat crop was generally good, but deficient moisture made the crop more dependent than usual upon weather developments from now until harvest time. Wheat prices were almost certain to be significantly lower than last year. If the pending 3/24/64 -46 legislative wheat and cotton programs were enacted, however, Government payments in the District would be substantially higher this year than last. Beef production continued to expand, and the volume of marketings was likely to be higher than last year\\'s record level. Cattle prices so far this year had averaged substantially lower than for the comparable period a year ago. Although prices were expected to show temporary improvement, depressed prices were probable this fall unless pasture and feed conditions became unusually favorable. Pasture conditions were relatively poor in the District at the present time, Mr. Clay noted. Precipitation had been normal or better since the first of the year. However, it had not been sufficient to replenish subsail moisture supplies, fill ponds, and bring stream flow back to normal in most areas because of the extreme drought conditions that prevailed last fall and early winter. Mr. Clay thought that developments in the national economy appeared to call for a monetary policy in line with the Committee\\'s objective of the last several months. Over all, he said, the economic situation con tinued to be ore of moderate expansion with ample and growing room for further expansion. Accordingly, reserves should be provided for continued commercial bank credit growth in the weeks ahead. It was too early to observe the effects of the Federal income tax cut on economic activity, but evidence of the hoped-for stimulus from that source should not in 3/24/64 -47 itself be a guide to lessened credit availability in any case. The Committee also would need to be mindful of the additional Treasury finan cing activity which presumbaly would be anncunced shortly. In a substantive sense, the current economic policy directive could serve satisfactorily for the period immediately ahead. However, in view of the length of time and the range of developments since the current directive was adopted in essentially its present form, a new wording of the directive would be in order. Alternative \"B\" of the directive drafts submitted by the Committee staff at the last meeting would appear to be a suitable choice, Mr. Clay thought. In his opinion, the Federal Reserve Bank discount rate should remain unchanged. Mr. Wayne said that the Richmond Bank\\'s latest information confirmed a continuing upward trend in Fifth District business and a further rise in business optimism. Their latest survey indicated broadly based gains in manufacturers\\' orders, backlogs, shipments, employment, and hours. Recent business statistics were predominantly favorable, with construction showing particular strength. Contract awards reached an all-time high for January and building permits set records for both January and February. Textile production continued at a good pace, although markets remained rather quiet, apparently anticipating the end of two-price cotton. Textile inventories had remained in balance largely because of substantial ship ments of goods sold months ago. Federal cigarette tax collections decreased again in February and were about 20 per cent below a year ago. 3/24/64 -48 In March, however, some cigarette plants returned to a five-day week. The farm outlook remained uncertain and constituted the weakest single factor in the District\\'s near-term prospects. According to preliminary figures, net farm income in the District fell 10 per cent last year as compared with a 3 per cent decline nationally. There was some evidence in the District, particularly among manufacturers, that expectations of rising prices might be accompanying improved business sentiment, Mr. Wayne reported. About one-fourth of all manufacturers participating in a recent survey conducted by the Richmond Bank\\'s Research Department indicated that they were now paying slightly more for raw materials, and nearly one-half reported small increases in machinery and equipment prices. More than one-third expected further price rises affecting materials, equipment, and labor. Mr. Wayne commented that the national economy, as a recent editorial described it, seemed to be \"cruising smoothly at a lofty alti tude.\" There was, in fact, rather marked evidence that the expansion which had persisted for more than three years was taking on new vigor. The consumer sector remained strong, especially in automobiles, and recent surveys reflected continuing consumer optimism. It was true that the ratio of consumer debt to disposable income had been high in recent months but the tax reduction automatically made this ratio more favorable. Also, the ratio of inventories to sales remained quite low. Outlays for new plant and equipment were substantially above year-ago levels and all indications pointed to a continued rise for a number of months to come. 3/24/64 -49 New orders for machine tools had shown outstanding strength in recent months. New construction spending had been at or near record levels for five months and housing starts pointed to a continued high level of activity in residential construction for the near future. On the whole, it appeared at this stage that currently available unused capacity plus prospective additions should provide the means to meet the growing demand for goods. Prospects to date seemed to add up to a solid and substantial expansion without any obvious weaknesses or excesses. In reviewing domestic and international developments over recent weeks, Mr. Wayne said he still found nothing that would justify a change in the posture of policy at this time. The recent flurry of price activity occasioned him some concern, but he believed it would be premature to interpret this as part of a general movement. In general, existing money and credit conditions appeared to be accommodating the latest business thrust with no significant pressure on interest rates or prices. Recent increases in rate structures abroad were clearly a source of concern. Nevertheless, there was no evidence that they required any policy response at this time. As a matter of fact, current reports indicated that our external position, at least for the present, had improved significantly. In addition, the Treasury\\'s operations in the market over the next few weeks suggested no action unless absolutely necessary. Both the inter national and the domestic situation could, of course, change quickly and the Committee had to remain sensitive to any evidence of change. For the 3/24/64 -50 reasons indicated, Mr. Wayne preferred to extend for a while the period of \"watchful waiting\" the Committee had entered some weeks ago. Accordingly, he favored renewing the current directive, with such changes of wording as might be approriate, and no change in the discount rate. He did not share Mr. Ellis\\' concern about the lack of change in the first paragraph of the directive since last summer. It reflected the fact that the Committee\\'s policy had remained unchanged over that period. Mr. Mills said that earlier in the meeting the difficulties had been discussed of accurately projecting movements in the supply of reserves and also the difficulties that arose out of the interpretations placed by the market on the published statistical record on the supply of reserves. In his opinion those problems went back to the Committee\\'s error in con ducting monetary and credit policy on the basis of interest rate considerations rather than concentrating its efforts and its actions on insuring the economy with an adequate and appropriate credit availability. His further comments would bear on these matters and, as it has happened, would refute the reasoning expressed ir the statements made by Messrs. Hayes and Ellis. Mr. Mills then made the following statement: In the period since the Committee\\'s last meeting, market forces have broken through the confines of what has been a rigidly and artificially imposed interest rate structure. Interest rates on longer-term U. S. Government securities have moved up and away from the basic short-term rate fixed by the Committee\\'s policy directive of \"no change\" and, in doing so, have demonstrated the long-run futility of any authoritarian attempt to control natural market forces. Unforeseen aberrations in the movements of reserves may very well have given market 3/24/64 -51 observers an impression of a stronger move toward credit re straint than that officially intended but, even so, the weight of evidence indicated no lessening of pressure on the credit markets, and yields on longer-term U. S. Government securities rose in response. These developments have been particularly unfortunate, both because higher interest rates are unwarranted and because they have come at a time when the unpredictable possibility of inflationary pressures is being actively discussed, and lead to a conclusion that the Federal Reserve System is already moving to counteract price and credit excesses foreseen through its economic intelligence facilities. Such interpretations of System policy intentions should be promptly corrected by in creasing the supply of reserves to a level that will visually dispel this belief at the same time that reasonable encouragement is given to credit expansion. In any event, it should be obvious that any overt policy actions now taken in the direction of credit restraint will risk precipitating some of the very difficulties sought to be avoided, by way of arousing needless immediate concern about inflationary problems that are still uncertain of eventuating and in so doing fostering harmful counteroffensive measures in the financial and business communities. Mr. Mills added that he was distressed by the amount of time taken at each meeting in reaching agreement about the wording of the directive, and he could only revert to the plea he had repeatedly made that the Committee go back to the kind of directive previously in effect, which included continuing instructions and cntained only a single clause expressing the Committee\\'s policy intent. Mr. Robertson commented as follows: With a Treasury cash financing announcement due momentarily, it seems clear that until our next meeting a policy of \"even keel\" is called for, guarding against any manifestations that might suggest even an ever-so-slight tightening of policy, such as occurred--for whatever reasons- during the past three weeks. I think this would be appropriate even in the absence of Treasury operations, for the economic consequences of the tax cut are still very 3/24/64 -52- uncertain, and I would not want any shift in monetary conditions to prejudice the economy\\'s response in any way. As a matter of fact, I believe we ought to be holding policy unchanged, through the next meeting and beyond, until such time as we will have reaped the full potential noninflationary stimulus of the tax cut. In my judgment, a tightening of policy will be warranted only if, as, and when we should develop a wave of speculative ebullience and general price increases that is plain for everyone to see. At that time, vigorous action ought to be called for; until such time, tightening of policy in fear of possible price increases would be premature and unwise. I do hope that following an \"even keel\" policy for the next few weeks will not cancel the salutary effects of the somewhat wider money market fluctuation that we happened to experience during March. I welcome the signs of somewhat more elastic dealer expectations with respect to short-term rate movements (even if it had to come from a temporary upward rate bounce in response to the British Bank rate action), and I hope we can keep the dealers from slipping back into the old assumption that only a very narrow band of bill rate fluctuation is \"acceptable\" to Federal Reserve and Treasury officials. I would also hope that we would not look with disfavor on even lower bill rates in the existing atmosphere. In a concluding remark, Mr. Robertson said that if a change in the directive was to be made, he thought the language suggested in Alternative \"B\" propcsed by the staff at the last meeting was appropriate, not only to reflect the change in the balance of payments situation but from other points of view as well. Mr. Shepardson said it seemed :o him that there were continuing and expanding waves of optimism as to the business future. This could lead to the possibility of further inflationary pressures. It was difficult to justify changing policy on the basis of anticipations. At the same time, it was hazardous to wait until everybody could see the signs of change, because developments then would be so far under way that drastic 3/24/64 -53 action would be required. This posed a dilemma. However, in the light of the continuing uncertainty regarding price pressures, and in light of the Treasury financing program, he thought it probably was wise to continue existing policy at this time. It would be appropriate to make minor changes in the directive on the technical points that had been mentioned, but otherwise he would advocate no change. Mr. Mitchell said he was concerned about the problem that Mr. Mills had noted--of the impressions the public was receiving of Committee policy. The Committee knew from the directives on which it had agreed that it had not changed policy. But outsiders had the impression that the Committee was shifting to a tighter policy because interest rates were rising, free reserves were lower, and the money supply had ceased growing since the first of the year. From these and other figures the market was concluding that the Systen: was leaning towards tightness, and that its next move would be in the direction of further tightness. Some members of the Committee seemed to have a rather rosy view of the present business situation, Mr. Mitchell continued. He would like to call attention to the fact that the index of industrial production had been oscillating in a narrow range for about eight months, and that present estimates indicated that GNP would rise only $7 or $8 billion in the current quarter, as compared with an increase of $11 billion in the fourth quarter of 1963. As Mr. Irons had said, the rate of expansion was moderate or slight. There also had been a substantial improvement in the balance of payments. 3/24/64 -54 Given these external indications, Mr. Mitchell thought the Committee had gotten itself into a vulnerable position with respect to its policy. He was not sure what could be done about this; perhaps Mr. Holland\\'s analysis provided the clue. The Desk could (1) aim for free reserves of not less than $100 million, and somewhere in the range between $100 and $200 million; (2) not act to prevent the bill rate from dropping below 3.50 per cent; and (3) permit the Federal funds rate to be lower than the disccunt rate more frequently than it had been. Such actions would give the market signals that the System had not moved to a firmer policy. Mr. Daane said that in his judgment the status quo in policy seemed to be clearly called for, not only because of the Treasury financing but also on the basis of both domestic and international considerations. He did not think the Committee should leap to conclusions about the balance of payments improvement until it had further confirmation of the recent trend. While he sympathized with Mr. Mitchell\\'s preference for somewhat higher free reserve figures, he would not like to see any great relaxation at the moment. The Treasury was on the eve of a cash financing, Mr. Daane noted. The size was as yet undetermined, but it was not likely to exceed $1 billion or $1-1/2 billion. As the Manager had indicated, the financing probably would involve a short maturity. Also, a one-year bill auction would be announced shortly. With announcements of these offerings to be made 3/24/64 -55 between now and the next meeting, and with payment dates also likely to occur within that period, he thought tha: the Committee could not dismiss the iplications of Treasury financings in deciding on policy. As one of the Board majority favoring operations outside the bill area, Mr. Daane continued, he thought there was a real opportunity for the Desk to take account of the availability of coupon issues and, within the marginal concept the Manager had outlined, to supply reserves in the period ahead by coupon purchases in some volume--not just token amounts. As the Chairman had noted at the last meeting, there was a continuing need to mesh System and Treasury operations. As he saw it, a tough job lay ahead for the Treasury. He thought that whenever it was clearly consistent with the Committee\\'s policy objectives and its needs for supplying reserves, the Committee should endeavor to operate in the manner most useful to all parties concerned. Mr. Daane agreed with those who favored some change in the wording of the directive to refer to the Treasury cash financing and also to the balance of payments improvement, although he would be cautious about using wording that implied that the payments problem had been solved. Mr. Hickman observed that business generally continued to expand. The most significant piece of business news since the last meeting was the report of the Commerce-SEC survey of capital spending plans, which indicated a larger gain for this year than earlier reports had indicated. Both industrial production and retail sales showed further gains in 3/24/64 -56 February. Nonfarm employment gained contraseasonally and the rate of unemployment dipped slightly. The February rise in retail sales on top of the revision that placed January above December brought the third successive monthly record. Indications were that strength in sales was being mair.tained in March. Steel output remained at a high level; incoming orders for steel had continued to expand in March, with a considerable share accounted for by the usual seasonal upswing. The outlook for steel production for the first half had now been revised upward to about 60 million ingot tons, which would be a new record for the period. The current high rate of steel production had begun to raise questions as to its sustainability. For autos, February was a month of further increases in seasonally adjusted sales and output. Sales during the first 20 days of March had been maintained at high levels. Output was expected to increase less than seasonally in March because of inventory adjustments in some of the slower noving lines. However, in the aggregate, dealers were currently holding one day less of inventories in relation to sales than they did a year ago. As for prices, Mr. Hickman said, recent increases for certain industrial commodities had had little effect on the over-all indexes. Since the last meeting, price increases had been announced for aluminum and its products, for copper, and for glass and glass containers. The Federal Reserve Board\\'s special grouping of sensitive materials prices 3/24/64 -57 continued to move up slightly in February. Moreover, several large groups of industries in the wholesale price index showed fractional rises for February, including chemicals, lumber and wood, pulp and paper, metals and metals products, machinery and automotive products, and nonmetallic mineral products. Those increases were offset by declines in other lines that occurred for special reasons. For example, a substantial decrease in fuel prices in February had been ascribed to the mild winter, while a decrease for bottled beverages was associated with a reduction in sugar prices. On balance, the more systematic tendencies within the wholesale price index appeared to be on the up side, while fortuitous elements were prominent on the down side. Recent economic developments in the Fourth District had continued to be favorable, although less exuberant than earlier. Parts of the District, of course, had been hard hit by the Ohio River flood, and there was evidence of some temporary slowing down as a consequence. However, the f.oodwalls around the major cities in the river valley prevented any major damage to the District\\'s economic structure. At the peak of the flood, 6,000 families were displaced in the five-county area around Cincinnati. There was heavy damage to roads, and high costs were incurred in the subsequent cleanup as the waters receded. The flood probably would trigger heavy Federal and State outlays in a variety of flood control projects along the Ohio River. 3/24/64 -58 Insofar as the next three weeks were concerned, Mr. Hickman saw no reason for any change in current System policy. For one thing, the Treasury might soon be in the market to raise new cash. The lower level of free reserves that prevailed in the past two weeks apparently did not cause any serious tightening in the market, since borrowings remained at about the same average level as in February. Over recent weeks the U. S. international position had appeared to be relatively satisfactory, despite the increase in the British Bank rate and the shift of funds from Italy to Germany, and the policy directive should probably be revised to reflect this. Some consideration should probably also be given to a revision of the directive to reflect an even keel position in view of the possibility of Treasury financing in the near future. The recent rise in bond yields and the return of the Desk to the bond market after an absence of nearly four months appeared to have been coincidental, on the basis of Mr. Stone\\'s remarks. In any event, the timing seemed to Mr. Hickman to have been unfortunate. Mr. Bopp reported that business in the Third District continued at fairly satisfactory levels, but the nation, as usual, seemed to be doing better than the District. Labor force indications were about as healthy as they ever got in the District; construction awards equaled 1963 totals for the same date; and department store sales were picking up fairly well as Easter approached. Since the Committee\\'s last meeting, moderate pressure on bank reserve positions had continued and some evi dence of a pickup in business loans had appeared. 3/24/64 -59 As he saw the economy, Mr. Bopp said, there was nothing new which might suggest a change from the present position of watchful waiting. Business still looked good, the balance of payments continued to improve, and prices, on the average, were steady. With the tax cut now in effect, it was certainly best to keep an open mind about the future. But he continued to feel that any departure from the present degree of ease should not be made until there was evidence of inflationary excesses. He would revise the directive to reflect the balance of payments improvement and the Treasury financing. Mr. Bryan said that he had nothing of significance to report for the Sixth District; activity seemed to be expanding moderately, as in the nation. At District banks loans, and the total of loans and investments, were still expanding. The most important development that he had detected was a marked improvement in business optimism, but he was not certain how significant this was. He thought there should be no change in policy at present. It was always difficult to say what \"no change\" meant, but he would like to see a free reserve figure of $100 million or more. Mr. Bryan said that a better term for the tax cut might be \"tax reallocation.\" It seemed to him that many localities were waiting to take advantage of the tax cut of the Federal Government, and most States could be expected to increase their taxes by at least part of the amount of the Federal reduction. Thus, the outcome of the Federal tax cut was apt to be a smaller reduction in total taxes, and possibly even an increase. 3/24/64 -60 Mr. Shuford said that economic activity in the Eighth District had continued to expand moderately in recent months. Employment in major labor markets had increased since last fall and there had been significant gains in the area of durable goods manufacturing. Spending had risen sharply since November as measured by department store sales, but as measured by bank debits the increase was much less pronounced. Business loans, which had declined from late last year through January, had shown a moderate increase since. Industrial use of electric power had changed little since last summer. The national economy continued to move along a strong upward trend, with production, employment, and sales statistics suggesting a continued healthy expansion. In view of the tax reduction and of prospects for consumer expenditures and capital investment the Committee needed to continue to watch price developments closely. So far, there seemed to be little real cause for concern. Movements in consumer prices had beer moderate, and wholesale prices remained stable on the average. Mr. Shuford said the improved international situation was encouraging. The balance of payments deficit had declined in the second half of 1963 and appeared to have fallen further so far this year, and the level of interest rates seemed to be reasonably aligned with rates abroad. While there was nothing at present in the balance of payments problem that constituted a constraint on domestic monetary policy, the Committee needed to continue to be alert to the problem. 3/24/64 -61 In sum, Mr. Shuford said, both the domestic economy and the balance of paynents continued to show progress within a monetary policy environment that had continued unchanged since the middle of last year. In view of this, he would favor making no basic change in policy. Recently there had been some increases in yields on both long and intermediate-term Governments, wiile the yield on Treasury bills had remained virtually unchanged. This firming was especially significant, Mr. Shuford thought, because rates were usually weak at this time of year, and the money supply recently had been more restricted than it was last fall. It was Mr. Shuford\\'s view that the Committee should avoid letting the pendulum swing further in the direction of restraint at this time. He thought that on the whole the Committee\\'s over-all monetary policy for the last few months had been about right. It would be desirable for interest rates to continue at about their present levels in the near future, especially in view of the Treasury financing. He favored no change in the discount rate, and he favored changes in the directive only to reflect the balance of payments improvement and the Treasury financing. He thought that. the Committee should continue to study the directive, as had been suggested at the last meeting. Mr. Balderston said that in view of the impending Treasury financing, he favored continuing present policy. Chairman Martin commented that he was well satisfied with the way things were going at the moment and he saw no need for making a change in policy. 3/24/64 -62 Noting that the Secretariat had been asked at the previous meeting to prepare a memorandum discussing problems of the directive, the Chairman said he gathered that more time was needed. He asked Mr. Young to report on the status of the study and also to present staff suggestions for changes in the wording of the directive at this meeting. Mr. Young said that a draft had been prepared of the memorandum on the directive that the Committee had requested, but further work was required to put it in a form appropriate for circulation. It was expected that the memorandum would be distributed to the Committee before the next meeting, and perhaps in about 10 days. With respect to the directive to be issued at this meeting, Mr. Young said that the staff thought no changes were required in the second paragraph. In the first paragraph, the staff proposed inserting the word \"moderately\" before \"adverse\" in the description of the balance of payments position, to reflect the recent improvement. It also proposed expanding the first sentence, which read, \"It is the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s current policy to accommodate moderate growth in bank credit\" by the addition of \"money supply and the reserve base\" at the end; and deleting the final sentence, which read \"In addition, it (this policy) recognizes the increases in bank credit, money supply, and the reserve base of recent months.\" This pair of changes seemed desirable because of the recent irregular movements in the aggregate series referred to. Finally, a slight revision in the next to last sentence was proposed to 3/24/64 -63 take account of the recent increase in the Japanese discount rate. This involved replacing the phrase \"in important European countries\" with the phrase \"in important countries abroad\" in referring to increases in foreign money rates. Mr. Young noted that several members had suggested including a reference to the Treasury financing. When such references had been made in the past, he said, they usually related to financings of a larger size than the one now in prospect, and he wondered whether any reference was in fact required to the imminent financing. In the ensuing discussion of the staff proposals, it was agreed that a reference to the Treasury financing should be included in the first paragraph, and that the statement relating to the balance of payments position should be formulated to allow for the possibility that final data might show that the balance was no longer adverse. Mr. Hayes questioned the desirability of eliminating the last sentence of the first paragraph on the ground that this sentence remained accurate as a description of longer run trends. Mr. Swan said he would strongly support eliminating the sentence because of changes in the tendencies of the data referred to since the first of the year. Mr. Hickman expressed a preference for focusing on longer run trends rather than month-to-month changes, and noted that he had some reservations about the reference to the money supply, in view of the problems of defining that term. 3/24/64 -64- Chairman Martin commented that the directive applied to a three-week period, and he did not think it could take account of all the cross-currents in developments over the past year. He felt that any directive could be read in various ways, depending on the emphasis that was placed on individual words. He was inclined to be sympathetic with Mr. Mills\\' point that the Committee spent too much time in meetings debating the specific language of its directive. After further discussion, and upon motion duly made and seconded, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: It is the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s current policy to accommodate moderate growth in bank credit, money supply, and the reserve base, while maintaining conditions in the money market that would contribute to continued improvement in the capital account of the U. 3. balance of payments. This policy takes into consideration the fact that domestic economic activity is expanding further, although with a margin of underutilized resources, and that it is likely to receive additional stimulus from the recently enacted reduction in Federal income tax rates. This policy also takes into account the facts that the balance of payments position, while improved, may still be adverse, and that the effects of increases in money rates in important countries abroad are as yet uncertain. In addition, it recognizes the imminence of new cash borrowing by the Treasury. To implement this policy, System open market operations shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the same conditions in the money market as have prevailed in recent weeks, while accommodating moderate expansion in aggregate bank reserves. 3/24/64 -65 Votes for this action: Messrs. Martin, Hayes, Balderston, Daane, Hickman, Mitchell, Robertson, Shepardson, Shuford, Swan, and Wayne. Vote against this action: Mr. Mills. Mr. Mills said he felt the first paragraph of the directive had little significance, and the heart of the directive lay in the second paragraph. The second paragraph directed the Manager of the Account to maintain about the same conditions in the money market as had prevailed in recent weeks, and in his judgment money market conditions in recent weeks had moved toward restriction rather than expansion. Accordingly, he dissented from the directive. Chairman Martin said that he did not agree that market conditions had moved toward restriction, and Messrs. Daane, Hayes, and Hickman associated themselves with the Chairman\\'s view. Mr. Mitchell said that he thought Mr. Mills had a sound point, but he believed the Committee was struggling to develop a type of directive that would present this kind of thing from happening. He hoped that the Committee would have a chance to put an improved directive into effect at the next meeting. Therefore, he voted to approve the directive. Chairman Martin reported that a draft had been prepared of a possible response to the request of the Subcommittee on Domestic Finance of the House Banking and Currency Committee for the Open Market Committee\\'s minutes for the years 1960-1963, inclusive. He thought the Committee should dispose of this subject by the next meeting. The gist of the draft was that the Committee had concluded that possible market 3/24/64 -66 repercussions and other considerations made it unwise for it to release its minutes for 1961 and later years without an appropriate lag. It did not specify any particular lag as appropriate. As Mr. Hayes had suggested at the last meeting, and as the Treasury had indicated, a case could be made for never releasing the foreign currency discussions, but this was projecting into the future. The letter also noted that the Committee was exploring means of making its records through 1960 available to scholars and others, as had been agreed at the last meeting. In response to a question, Chairman Martin said he thought the position taken in the draft was quite tenable under the law, which required that the Committee policy actions be reported to Congress but did not require that its minutes be given to Congress. Chairman Martin then suggested that the members study the draft from the points of view both of the desirability of the position taken and of the language used, and send their comments to the Secretary as soon as possible. He would hope that a final decision would be taken at the next meeting of the Committee, and a response sent to the Subcommittee promptly thereafter. Mr. Hayes said he would like to raise a question about publication of the Manager\\'s Report to the Committee of Open Market Operations in 1963, with suitable deletions of confidential material. Last year, he noted, the report on 1962 operations had been published in the April Federal Reserve Bulletin and reprinted in the New York Bank\\'s Monthly Review for May. 3/24/64 -67 The report had met with quite a good response. The academic community, in particular, had found it to be an enlightening commentary on the conduct of System operations. The New York Bank alone had had requests for over one thousand reprints of the article. This year, as the Committee knew, the second portion of the 1963 report--the detailed chronological section--was being published as part of the Board\\'s Annual Report. Mr. Hayes believed there would be an interested audience for the more analytical review given in the first section of the report, and suggested that publication be considered in a format similar to that adopted a year ago. In the case of the chronolo gical section, this would mean some duplication of the material in the Board\\'s Annual Report, but he believed it would be worthwhile, reaching a somewhat different audience and providing the detailed background that would enhance the interpretation of the more general review. Chairman Martin suggested that the Committee members review the material in question and be prepared at the next meeting to express their views on Mr. Hayes\\' suggestion. Mr. Mitchell commented that in reaching views on Mr. Hayes\\' proposal the members should read the first part of the Board\\'s Annual Report also, and Chairman Martin concurred in this suggestion. 3/24/64 -68 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, April 14, 1964. Thereupon the meeting adjourned. Secretary ',\n",
       " 'A meeting of the Federal Open Market. Committee was held in the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ii Washington on Wednesday, June 17, 1964, at 9:30 a.m. PRESENT : Mr. Martin, Chairman Mr. Hayes, Vice Chairman Mr. Hickman Mr. Mills Mr. Mitchell Mr. Robertson Mr. Shepardson Mr. Shuford Mr. Swan Mr. Wayne Messrs..

Eisenmenger and Lynn, Directors of Research at the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and San Francisco, respectively Mr. Kareken, Economic Consultant, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on May 26, 1964, were approved. Before this meeting there had been distributed to the members of the Committee a report from the Special Manager of the System Open Market Account on foreign exchange market conditions and on Open Market Account and Treasury operations in foreign currencies for the period May 26 through June 10, 1964, and a supplementary report covering the period June 11 through June 16, 1964. Copies of these reports have been placed in the files of the Committee. Supplementing the written reports, Mr. Coombs said that the gold stock would remain unchanged again this week for the eighteenth week in a row. The Stabilization Fund had on hand $231 million with prospective sales of roughly $66 million between now and the end of the month, suggesting a month end balance of $165 million. This total might be increased by $15 million or so, representing the U. S. share 6/17/64 -3 of the Gold Pool intake during June. On the London gold market demand had been relatively light in recent weeks, but on the other hand the Russians had remained out of the market. Mr. Coombs reported that the exchange markets continued to be characterized by cross-currents. On the one hand, there was gratifying evidence of a strengthening of confidence in the dollar in most exchange markets, partly reflecting the favorable trend in the country\\'s balance of payments since last summer, the improved gold position of the United States, and the emergence of both inflationary and balance of payments problems in a number of European countries. On the other hand, the strenuous efforts of certain European central banks to counter such inflationary pressures by credit restraint continued to induce a repa triation of dollar investments by foreign commercial banks in an effort to escape the liquidity squeeze on their positions. Mr. Coombs thought it likely that these exchange market pressures on the dollar would be further intensified by seasonal factors, such as tourist spending, durin- the summer months. Switzerland remained one of the major trouble spots, Mr. Coombs commented. The U. S. still owed $130 million of Swiss francs under swap arrangements with the Swiss National Bank and the Bank for International Settlements. However, he thought that after repeated delays the $100 million swap deal between the Bank of Italy and the Swiss National Bank, which would indirectly enable the System to pay off $100 million of its 6/17/64 -4 Swiss franc debt, was now close to completion. He had talked with both the Swiss and the U. S. Treasury with respect to settlement of the ramaining $30 million and he was hopeful that this remaining debt would be settled on or before June 30 by a Swiss purchase of gold from the U. S. Treasury. Meanwhile, however, the Swiss National Bank had continued to take in dollars as the Swiss commercial banks repatriated overseas investments in order to strengthen their liquidity positions, as well as to prepare for their end of June window dressing date. As of yesterday (June 16), Mr. Coombs said, the Swiss National Bank was carrying $130 million over and above its traditional ceiling of $175 million. He thought it would be inappropriate to draw upon the swap lines to mop up part or all of these surplus dollar balances, since the credit squeeze which produced them might continue for a good many months to come. In these circumstances, Mr. Coombs thought it would be far better to work out some sort of a combined approach in which the Swiss might undertake to lift somewhat the ceiling on their dollar holdinge, and to take a few more medium-term Swiss franc bonds, while the U. S. Treasury might sell the Swiss another $25 million or so of gold. If, on the other hand, as a result of the British election or other developments, there should be speculative inflows into Switzerland, Mr. Coombs thought that they might appropriately be dealt with by Federal Reserve or other central bank credit operations. If the bulk of such an 6/17/64 -5 inflow were to come from London, Mr. Coomb: said, he would be hopeful that the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank would themselves absorb a goodly part of the pressure through a bilateral credit such as that arranged during the sterling crisis of 1961. The second trouble spot was the German mark situation, Mr. Coombs continued. During the late spring months, the mark had held relatively steady as the very sizable German trade surplus was more or less offset by capital outflows caused by announcement of a proposed withholding tax on nonresident income from German securities. During the past ten days or so, however, strong buying pressure on the mark had developed and since June 4th the Bundesbank had been forced to take in a total of $265 million. This change seemed to be largely attrib utable to a tailing off of capital outflows plus some temporary tightening of the German market and window dressing for June 30. There also had been some evidence of speculation arising out of reports that high-ranking German financial officials; were inclined to favor a widening of the margins on the mark. The Account had so far refrained, however, from drawing on the swap to deal w.th the situation, partly because the German trade surplus might well run on for a good many months to come and should, therefore, be dealt with by medium-term credit arrangements, such an additional issues of D-mark bonds. Such an additional issue was, in fact, already planned in the amount of $200 million equivalent value July 1. Mr. Coombs thought that a resumption of forward operations in German marks for Treasury account also would 6/17/64 -6 be helpful, and the Account had so recommended to the Bundesbank. The Bundesbank had agreed to such a resumption of forward operations as soon as the forward premium reached 1 per cent, but was reluctant to operate below that level for fear of undercutting its special investment swap arrangements with the German commercial banks, which carried a rate of 1/2 per cent. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, and by unanimous vote, the System Open Market Account transactions in foreign currencies during the period May 26 through June 16, 1964, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. Mr. Coombs noted that two swap drawings in Swiss francs would mature on Jun 30: one for $30 million on the Bank for International Settlements, and one for $20 million on the Swiss National Bank. As he had mentioned, he was hopeful that both drawings would be liquidated by June 30 but, in the event that further delays materialized, he requested the Committee\\'s approval of renewal in each case for another three months. Both drawings initially had been made on December 31, 1963, and this would be the second renewal in each case. Renewals of the drawings on the swap arrangements with the Bank for International Settlements and the Swiss National Bank, if they should prove necessary, were noted with out objection. Mr. Coombs then observed that the $50 million standby swap arrangement with the Bank of Sweden would mature on July 17, and he recommended its renewal, with an extension of term from three to six 6/17/64 -7 months. He .ad reason to believe that the Bank of Sweden would be agreeable to such an extension. More generally, Mr. Coombs said, as he had indicated in his memorandum on this subject to the Committee dated June 12, 1964, he thought it would be desirable to lengthen the terms of the standby swap arrangements whenever possible. (Note: A copy of the memorandum referred to has been placed in the files of the Committee.) He believed this would give the System\\'s swap network a more solid appearance. If the Committee approved he would plan to negotiate extensions of the terms of other arrangements as they approached maturity. In response to Mr. Wayne\\'s question concerning the attitude of the French to such extensions of term, Mr. Coombs said the fact that several of the swap arrangements already had terms of six and twelve months would leave the French little oasis on which to protest in this case. He would plan to approach the French concerning an extension of the term of the arrangement with them relatively late, after the terms of most or all other arrangements had been extended. He thought they probably would agree at that time. Mr. Scanlon asked whether any other central banks might view a term extension unfavorably, and if so whether the Account would press the matter. Mr. Coombs replied that he thought a majority of central banks were clearly favorable, and that the others probably would go along when he negotiated with them at a later date. But in his judgment it would be a mistake to press the matter if there was any resistance. 6/17/64 -8 Mr. Mills commented that there was rising discussion of growing confidence in the dollar, and he asked whether the time was not approaching when requests for extension of the terms of swap arrangements should come as proposals from the other parties to the arrangements rather than from the System. The United States ccnstantly seemed to lead from weakness rather than from strength, and it appeared to him that under present circumstances it would be reasonable to let suggestions for extension come from other countries. Mr. Coombs replied that in each of the four arrangements whose terms presently were greater than three months the initiative had come from the other party. Moreover, in the current discussions among the Group of Ten several European countries had raised the question of making such longer terms more general. There seemed to be real advantages; to accelerating the process at this time. He did not think that in past negotiations the other countries involved had thought the United States was leading from weakness. The dollar held so central a place in the international payments system that other countries expected the United States to feel a deep sense of responsibility for the whole system. Mr. Swan asked what advantage there was in having the arrangements variously on six, nine, and twelve month terms, rather than employing six month terms on a uniform basis. Mr. Coombs commented that to set all terms at six months would mean cutting back the two that now were at twelve months. In his judgment, the fewest problems would be posed if 6/17/64 -9 term extensions were negotiated on a gradual basis; he would expect all of them to be at twelve months in due course. Mr. Mitchell asked whether Mr. Coombs felt the System made any sort of moral commitment to accommodate the needs of the other country when it entered into a swap arrangement. In his judgment, arrangements with terms up to twelve months made sense in the case of major countries, but he wondered whether there was any advantage to longer-term swap arrangements with smaller nations of only peripheral importance in connection with U. S. trade and payments. It was possible, he thought, that the System might find itself in an awkward position if it had a twelve-month swap arrangement with a country of the latter type which began encountering serious payments difficulties. Mr. Coombs commented that the System could decline to agree to a proposal for a drawing under a standby swap arrangement, and it might want to do so if the other country was in a particularly bad situation, but he thought it was desirable in genera to give the country the benefit of any doubt. There also was no commitment to renew standby arrangements when they matured. However, they always had been renewed in the past, and a failure to renew in a particular case would risk giving the impression that the network was beginning to erode. Because of the expectation that maturing arrangements would be renewed, the proposal to lengthen their terms really had few substantive implications. The advantage was that longer term agreements would give an appearance of 6/17/64 -10- greater solidity to the network which, he thought, was of particular importance now in light of the discussions under way on the future of the international payments system. Mr. Mitchell commented that he thought the mistake had been made when the network originally was extended to include some of the countries of peripheral importance. Mr. Hayes observed that most of the smaller countries in the network--such as Austria and Sweden--were in pretty solid condition. Mr. Furth added that the support given by some of these smaller countries in various international meetings to the U. S. position stressing the viability of the present payments system was perhaps attributable in part to the fact that the System had entered into swap arrangements with their central banks. Renewal of the swap arrangement with the Bank of Sweden, with extension of term from three to six months, as recommended by Mr. Coombs, was approved. Chairman Martin suggested that the Committee authorize negotiation of extensions to a period not to exceed twelve months of the terms of maturing swap arrangements, and no objections were made. Mr. Coombs then noted that the Committee had received his memorandum dated June 11, 1964, concerning the request of the National Bank of Belgium to increase the rate of interest applicable to funds drawn and invested under the swap arrangement with that Bank from 2-3/4 per cent to 3-1/2 per cent. (Note: A copy of this memorandum has been 6/17/64 -11 placed in the files of the Committee.) He recommended approval of the Belgian request, which, he said, would be acceptable to the U. S. Treasury. An increase in this rate of interest, as recommended by Mr. Coombs, was approved. Chairman Martin then invited Mr. Hayes to bring the Committee up to date on the negotiations among the Group of Ten Deputies with respect to statistical reporting arrangements. He noted that Mr. Daane, who presently was attending the meetings in Paris, would be able to make a fuller report on this subject at the Committee\\'s meeting of July 7. But since the matter was likely to be discussed in Basle on July 6, it was desirable for members to have an opportunity to make any comments they had today. Mr. Hayes said that, as the Committee probably knew, the Group of Ten study group had put out a Deputies\\' report covering a number of subjects. Among other things, an effort had been made to systematize reporting on methods of financing imbalances in international payments. In dealing with this subject, the report referred at several points to swaps and similar short-term arrangements, although it did not devote a great deal of space to them. The American position consistently had been that it was necessary to proceed carefully with respect to reports on these operations: because of their highly sensitive character, it was important to preserve their confidentiality. The Americans also had noted that by the very nature of these operations, it was essential 6/17/64 -12 to be able to work things out promptly, and any arrangements that required multilateral surveillance would be unfortunate. The Deputies agreed with the American view that central bank credit operations were specially sensitive, and excluded them from the regular reporting system. Their report included the following statement, which the American representatives at the meeting felt was a desirable resolution of this questi.on: It is important that the effectiveness of central bank operations should be preserved. Hence, with respect to use of swap arrangements and other official short-term bilateral credit between central banks, the Governors of the central banks of the group may wish to consider together whether information should continue to be provided orally. The present practice of reporting has been generally successful in avoiding premature disclosures and unfortunate market reactions. Mr. Hayes said we had taken the position, which he thought the Treasury would support, that the following principles should be adhered to: First, confidentiality should be preserved with respect to these operations, with disclosure only by mutual consent of the parties con cerned. Since situations might arise in which one party to a transaction would be reluctant to disclose certain operations to all governments, both should have the right to object. Second, to the extent possible, reporting should be kept on an informal and oral basis, as in the past; information on delicate situations should not be put in a mimeographed report. Of course, the data could be published after a suitable time lag. 6/17/64 -13 With respect to transmitting information to Working Party 3, this seemed unobjectionable in principle since the System did disclose information on its own use of swap credits to central banks, so that the information presumably was available to government representatives on WP-3. Here also, reports preferably should be oral and informal, and they would best be made by the borrowing country. The same general rules would apply to disclosure of new credits and of new swap arrange ments, The System, of course, did publi.h information promptly on new swap arrangements, and others might be encouraged to do so, although a rigid rule on the matter probably would be inadvisable. Before this meeting there had been distributed to the members of th, Committee a report from the Manager of the System Open Market Account covering open market operations in U. S. Government securities and bankers\\' acceptances for the period May 26 through June 10, 1964, and a supplementary report covering the period June 11 through June 16, 1964. Copies of these reports have been placed in the files of the Comm.ttee. In supplementation of the written reports, Mr. Stone commented as follows: During the recent period the money market again displayed its capacity for the smooth handling of large flows of funds, accommodating without difficulty the cash sale of $1 billion of new Treasury bills, and the flows associated with the June 10 dividend date and the June 15 quarterly corporate tax date. The net result of these factors, together with a tendency for marginal reserve availability to average somewhat below the level 6/17/64 -14- of the preceding few weeks, was a slightly firmer cast to the money market. Dealer financing needs were enlarged and in turn the dealers relied more heavily on financing from the money market banks--particularly as corporations pulled money back from the dealers to pay dividends and taxes. Indicators of market tone remained within the range of variation established during recent months, however. Thus, average member bank bor rowing, perhaps the best single indicator of market tone under present conditions, remained in the general area of $200-$300 million. Similarly, Treasury bill rates continued to move rather narrowly over the period. Indeed, the three-month bill rate varied only between 3.46 and 3.48 per cent through most of the period, while the six-month bill ranged from 3.57 to 3.60 per cent. This stability was maintained despite the increased supplies of bills that came into the market toward mid-June with the approach of the dividend and tax dates. At least in part, the stability reflected a willingness of dealers to hold larger positions in the expectation that no significant change in interest rates is on the immediate horizon. Yesterday, the three-month bill that had been auctioned on Monday at an average issuing rate a little under 3.50 per cent edged up to a bid quotation of 3.51 per cent in the market--the first time since ea:ly April that the market rate on this maturity has exceeded the discount rate. Prices of Treasury notes and bonds tended slightly higher during the recent period, but the rise lacked vigor and trading activity was generally light. The prevalent attitude seems to be that prices and rates are not likely to move much in either direction over the immediate future. I should mention that dealers have continued to make fairly good progress in distri buting their holdings of the Treasury\\'s recently issued 4-1/4 per cent bond; although some of these bonds were sold on switches out of other intermediate issues, dealer holdings in the 5-to-10 year maturity area were reduced by nearly $100 million in the past three weeks. The markets in corporate and municipal securities were mixed during the past few weeks. Underwriters generally exhibited a good interest in bidding for new issues, but investor receptions frequently were unenthusiastic. In a number of cases syndicates were terminated with appreciable balances still unsold. The ensuing upward yield adjustments were generally small, and did not suffice in all cases to complete the distribution of new issues. A noteworthy excep tion was the quick sellout of $150 million General Motors Acceptances Corporation debentures at a 4.64 per cent yield. 6/17/64 -15- In the meantime, some attention is being paid in both the Treasury and other securities markets to possible Treasury financing just ahead. The most widely held view in the market seems to be that the Treasury is likely to raise around $3 billion in July through the sale of a tax anticipation bill maturing next March. Receipts are running above expectations, however, and expenditures are thus far falling short of earlier forecasts, so that current indications are that the Treasury may not need nearly as much as $3 billion in July, and indeed it is possible that its needs will be under $1 billion. If this should be the case, the Treasury would probably have an opportunity to undertake some financing designed to achieve some lengthening of the debt structure. This might take the form of a cash sale of a moderate-sized issue in the note or short bord area, or it could take the form of an advance refunding operation that would perhaps be open to holders of the August 1964 maturities as well. Announcement of any new borrowing plans, however, would be contingent not only on the outcome of the Treasury\\'s cash position but also upon Con gressional action in regard to the debt ceiling. The legal ceiling drops sharply at the end of this month, and the Treasury would not be able to announce any new financing plans until a new ceiling is enacted. The upshot is that considerable uncertainty clouds the current Treasury financing scene. The calendar seems to be clear at least until near the end cf June, but the Treasury may well be in the market from that point through the first part of July and again in August--with the particular types of operations still to be decided upon. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, with Mr. Mills dissenting, the open market transactions in Government securities and bankers\\' acceptances during the period May 26 through June 16, 1964, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. Mr. Mills dissented from this action because he thought the operations of the Account Management since the preceding meeting had been at fault, in a manner that he described in the course of his statement later in the meeting. 6/17/64 -16- Chairman Martin then called for the staff economic and financial reports, supplementing the written reports that had been distributed prior to the meeting, copies of which have been placed in the files of the Committee. Mr. Noyes presented a statement on economic conditions as follows: In preparing for this meeting I had occasion to refer back several times to the minutes of the meetings of the Committee just after the turn of the year--and to review both my own remarks and those of others at that time. This is always a potentially embarrassing exercise, but on this occasion the reaction is more philosophical. The striking thing is that at that time we all thought, for one reason or another, that we would be able to see the economic future more clearly by June. June is now upon us and we have most of the statistics for May at hand, yet the future still seems as uncertain to me, at least, as it did four or five months ago. I am unable to persuade myself that the danger of an inflationary surge is behind us, but I find it equally dif ficult to develop evidence that such a surge is either underway or in immediate prospect. In most respects the economy is moving forward along a path very close to one that observers agreed would be desirable, but few thought would be realized in all its aspects. Some doubted that we would get the amount of economic expansion which has materialized, while others felt we might get it, but that it would almost certainly be accom panied by upward pressures on both the prices of goods and services and on interest rates. You will recall that the staff made some projections shortly after the first of the year of the quarterly pattern of GNP, the major indexes of business activity, and the flows of funds in the economy which would be consistent with the end-of-year aggregates used in the President\\'s Budget and Economic messages. The figures for the first quarter were generally not too far from the projected pattern and early estimates for the second quarter also are surprisingly close, with deviations generally on the favorable side. Specifically, the original projection for second quarter GNP was $618 billion and the staff is now estimating it will be around $620 billion. The quarterly average for the production index in the projection 6/17/64 -17- worked out to 130.2, which will be right on the nose if we get another 0.7 point increase in June. Unemployment is a little lower than expected, even if we assume that all of the improve ment from April to May will not be maintained in June. Price behavior is, in many ways, the biggest surprise of all. While various models were constructed on the assump tion of price stability, I doubt that even the people who made the assumption had much confidence in it. I am certain that no one even imagined in January that the lead sentence of the June 15 release of the BLS on wholesale prices would read, \"Primary market prices moved 0.2 per cent lower in May, continuing a down trend which has prevailed since the beginning of the year.\" Very few would have guessed that the upcreep in the consumer price index would be less in the first four months of 1964 than it was in 1962 or 1963. I had to pinch myself to be sure I wasn\\'t dreaming when I found a widely read economic columnist reporting, in Monday night\\'s paper, that price weakness was a major threat to continuing prosperity. These isolated observations--chosen intentionally to highlight the difference between what has happened to prices and what was generally expected 5 months ago--probably exag gerate the degree of price stability we have achieved. There have been upward pressures in some important markets--notably those for nonferrous metals, where the most recent development is a 2 per cent increase in the price of aluminum ingots. Nevertheless it is hard not to be impressed, and a little puzzled, by the remarkable continuation of price stability. To summarize, and point up some of the most recent data, the figures for industrial production, announced yesterday, showed April revised up 0.4 to 129.6, and a further gain in May of 0,7, bringing the index for last month to 130.3. Unemployment in May dropped to a surprising, and probably unsustainable, low of 5.1 per cent. Retail sales rose 1-1/2 per cent in May from an April level that also was revised upward. Wholesale prices declined in May to 100.1 per cent of the 1957-59 average, which is also just 1/10 of 1 per cent above the year ago level. Capital spending plans, as reported to Commerce-SEC, have been revised upward to show a 12 per cent year-to-year increase, but a good share of the increase is accounted for by the fact that we are doing more in the first half than expected. Hence the new survey does not imply as much of a change from the first half to the second as the earlier estimates. 6/17/64 -18- I have searched for something less trite than \"just too good to be true\" to say in conclusion, but that phrase fits domestic economic developments so perfectly I am unable to avoid it. Mr. Holland made the following statement concerning financial developments: A kind of stubborn stability has characterized interest rates and debt market conditions since about mid-May. Markets have given little ground in the face of a succession of potentially unsettling influences, ranging as widely as the stream of stronger business news, indications of less favorable balance of payments developments, inve:tor resistance to aggres sively priced new offerings in the capital market, the onset of June tax and dividend date pressures, and the publication of two weeks of relatively low free reserve figures. In part, this market stability has seemed to draw strength from renewed investor confidence that no change in monetary policy was in the offing. But there has also been an apparent close balance of supplies and demands for funds in the credit markets generally. As Mr. Stone has indicated, the money market itself moved up to and through the tax and dividend period fairly smoothly. From mid-May up until the tax-date week itself, borrowing at the discount windows by reserve city banks actually was smaller this year than last. But out in the country member banks, signs of somewhat greater reserve pressures have been prevalent, and this has been a factor in the lower aggregate free reserve figures of recent weeks. Over the past two months, more country banks have been borrowing from the Reserve Banks; they have been borrowing greater aggregate dollar amounts; and their excess reserves have moved erratically around a lower level than earlier. Deposit reports from these banks suggest that a stronger than seasonal local credit and deposit expansion may be an inportant factor in this country bank experience. There is one tax date development that may help to clarify a recent trend. According to first reports, tax date borrowing by both financial and nonfinancial corporations at the big New York City banks appears a good deal larger than expected, and considerably stronger relative to previous years than was true over the March tax date. Coming as this does on the heels of a moderately strengthened business loan demand over the last nine weeks, it may signify emerging corporate needs for a little more bank assistance in covering operating and capital outlays. 6/17/64 -19- Other types of credit demands associated with purchases of goods and services have shown little change in their rate of advance since the date of the tax cut. To accommodate such loan expansion, along with temporary fluctuations in securities loans, banks as a whole have further reduced the relative importance of their investment portfolios, slowing their pur chases of municipals and selling Governments on balance. These reduced bank takings of securities have been matched by the securities purchases of nonbank investors, who are channeling more of their financial investment through market instruments, and less through deposit-type intermediaries. The result has been to reduce the degree of intermediation in recent financial flows, without thus far any major impact on interest rates. Total bank credit figures have fluctuated sharply over this period, chiefly reflecting temporary bulges\\'associated with changes in the timing, form, and amount of Treasury financings and tax receipts. Cutting through these month-to month swings, the average rate of growth in total bank credit over the first five months of 1964 amounted to about a 6-3/4 per cent annual rate, roughly matching the rate of expansion in gross national product. The bulk of this bank credit advance was associated with the growth in time deposits, as money supply expanded at only a 2 per cent annual rate over this period. Figures for the first part of June suggest an increase in bank credit and money supply through the tax date, with prospects for some subsequent fal:back in these aggregates through the remainder of the month. One cannot look very far ahead, however, without taking explicit account of the potential impact of Treasury finance. Government financial operations will bulk large in future banking developments, and the possible scope of such opera tions is sharply different from the expectations of a few months or even a few weeks ago. As our staff sees it, the Treasury\\'s operating balance at the end of June could now approach $10 billion, largely because of the continuation of a less than expected rate of expenditure. This provides a cash cu;hion large enough to cover more than a third of the Government\\'s entire second-half cash need, now estimated by our staff at $11 billion, more than half of which is concentrated in July. While this expected July-December cash deficit is $1 to $2 billion larger than in the two preceding years, the snap back to a cash surplus in the succeeding January-June period is even sharper, bringing the projected full-year cash deficit to be financed to below $4 billion for fiscal 1965, significantly 6/17/64 -20- smaller than for fiscal 1964, and a shade below fiscal 1963. The consequence is to give a rare degree of flexibility to the Treasury debt managers, once the debt ceiling question is settled. If the market is not upset in the next few weeks, and the Treasury opts for one of the major debt lengthening alternatives outlined by Mr. Stone, the results from a central bank point of view should include a darpening influence on intermediate and longer term credit markets this summer, followed by a substantially lighter burden of Government financing to coincide with the seasonal rise in private credit demands this fall. Some intervening downward pressure on bill rates might result, but given the level of bank borrowings implicit in current free reserve levels, three-month bill yields should not be able to be depressed very far below the discount rate. And, looking at the broader picture, the resultant better phasing of public and private borrowing pressures could prove to be a salutary influence on future financial and economic developments. Mr. Furth presented the following statement on the balance of payments. The U. S. payments balance in recent weeks has been less unfavorable than in April but less favorable than during the first quarter. According to the so-called flash report, the payments deficit anounted in the month of May to $107 million, as compared with $475 million for April; and the latest tenta tive weekly figures suggest that it continued at about the same rate during the first ten days of June. Since May is considered to be a seasonally favorable month, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of the deficit for the past six weeks was perhaps in the neighborhood of $2 billion, slightly higher than the rates for the first four months of the year and for the second half of 1963. This result is particularly disappointing because the financial character of the deficit has changed for the worse. Taking the ten-month period from July 1963 through April 1964, the conventionally calculated deficit of $1.6 billion was covered by \"special\" receipts of $760 million, an increase in liabilities to nonofficial foreigners of $1,020 million, and a decline in the U. S. net position in the IMF of $200 million. U. S. gold and foreign exchange reserves actually 6/17/64 -21- rose $40 nillion, and liabilities to foreign monetary authorities declined by $320 million. Moreover, U. S. bank-reported short term claims on foreigners rose by $930 million. Both on the \"official settlement\" basis and on the \"total net liquidity\" basis, the deficit was fully offset by the \"special\" foreign debt prepayments. Counting these prepayments as the receipts which they certainly are from the point of view of liquidity analysis, the U. S. payments position in that ten-month period was actually in balance. In contrast, the figures for the six weeks from April 30 to June 10 suggest that U. S. reserves diminished by $160 mil lion and liabilities to foreign authorities rose $300 million. The conventionally calculated deficit was reduced to tolerable dimensions because foreign private dollar holdings declined by $340 million. The tentative figures probably exaggerate the shift since (in contrast to the final data) they include interna tional organizations among foreign authorities, and some part of the change may reflect seasonal movements, and another part of the reversal of previous dollar \"swaps\" between the German Federal Bank and German commercial banks. Nevertheless it seems certain that on an \"official settlement\" and perhaps also on a \"total net liquidity\" basis the deficit rate was very much higher than during the preceding ten months. Since I consider both of these bases more meaningful standards for measuring a country\\'s international payments position than the conventional method, I am afraid that the U. S. payments position may once again have becone a problem. Unfortunately, the available data do not permit any reliable analysis of the causes of the deterioration. Three obvious possibilities may be considered: First, the trade surplus may have been further reduced in May and June, reflecting both the upswing of the U.S. economy and the import-restricting impact of European actions. Secord, the uncertainty effect of the proposed interest equalization tax may already have worn off, especially as to Canadian borrowers; and perhaps more important, U. S. enter prises appear eager to make full use of opportunities to acquire cheaply industrial participations in European countries that suffer from a dearth of capital thanks to the credit restrictions imposed by their monetary authorities. And third, renewed uncertainty created by rumors of revaluations and devaluations of European currencies may again have led to flows of \"hot money\" not only in recorded but even more so in unrecorded transactions, involving in particular a shift of foreign dollar holdings from private into official hands. 6/17/64 -22- In contrast to this disappointing turn of most recent events, the favorable results of the first quarter have been reflected in the attitude of the two leading international monetary institutions, the BIS and the IMF. The Annual Report of the BIS gives the United States, for the first time in some years, a virtually clean bill of health, only mildly expressing hope that the United States would not prevent interest rates from rising if this proved necessary, and advocating some further reduction in government expenditures abroad. Similarly, the IMF draft of its report on the recent consultation with the United States expresses the conviction that the U. S. payments problem \"has turned the corner.\" Moreover, the draft of the IMF Annual Report comes out strongly on the side of the United States in the current controversy on the working of the reserve currency system and the reform of the international payments mechanism. It unequivocally endorses the continued use of reserve currencies as international means of payments and reserve assets, and comes to the conclusion that the international liquidity problem can be fully solved by the modest increase in IMF resources advocated by the United States. In view of the reported close personal relations between the Managing Director of the IMF and the head of the country that so far has most strenuously opposed the U. S. position in the Group of Ten, the IMF report may perhaps foreshadow a successful completion of the current negotiations of that Group. As you know, the System recently has conducted a survey of bank lending to foreigners. Not unexpectedly, it appears that ten or twelve very large banks account for the great bulk of both outstanding claims on foreigners and recent increases in such claims, particularly in the long-term sector. But as usual, these conclusions need some refinement and qualifications; if the Committee so desires, the staff will shortly distribute a more detailed statistical and analytical presentation of the results. There was general agreement that the staff should distribute the more detailed presentation to which Mr. Furth referred in his concluding comment. Chairman Martin then called for the usual go-around of comments and views on economic conditions and monetary policy, beginning with Mr. Hayes, who presented the following statement: 6/17/64 -23- As we look over the whole economic and financial scene today, I think we cannot help being impressed by the solidity of the situation and the cheerfulness of the outlook, espe cially as compared with a year ago, or in fact with any other recent period. Most business indices are at all-time highs, and we have even seen at last some progress with that slippery problem, unemployment. I hope this progress will prove lasting. There is no doubt that confidence abroad in the dollar is stronger than it has been for several years. Yet as soon as we look behind this happy set of circumstances we cannot avoid a feeling of uneasiness over possible trouble ahead- possibly in the way of renewed inflationary pressures at home, and probably in the way of an adverse movement in our balance of payments that could cause great disillusionment abroad and could seriously jeopardize the dollar\\'s new-found strength. Our policy decisions rarely seem easy but today they seem especially puzzling. Most of the major statistical data that have become available in the last few weeks tend co confirm the bright business outlook, without, however, any clear signs of an accelerated advance that would turn into an authentic boom. Such data include the new Commerce-SEC survey of capital spending plans, record retail sales in May, and the decline in the unemployment rate to close to 1 per cent. Price indices continue to show the same degree of stability as in recent years, and recent specific price announcements, as well as the latest purchasing agents report, suggest that upward pressures have eased slightly. On the other hand, there is a danger that the coming major wage settlements may turn out to be excessive in comparison with over-all productivity gains. Recent banking statistics suggest that lessened monetary ease has begun to exert a moderating influence on credit rowth this year--a development which I would consider all to the good -while a similar dampening in growth rates this year is indicated with respect to bank reserves, money supply, and .ime deposits. On the other hand, total bank loans have been growing at a relatively fast pace, and there are some tentative signs that demand for business loans and for total nonsecurity loans may be accelerating after they lagged earlier in the year. These various developments have put increased pressure on bank liquidity, as evidenced by a continuing updrift in loan-deposit ratios. It is important to recognize, however, that none of these credit trends is yet very pronounced; the impression of a change in pace based on observations of five or six months could easily be reversed by data for a few 6/17/64 -24- additional months. One major uncertainty concerns the extent to which growing business investment will be taken care of by corporate cash flows and the extent tc which an increase in such requirements will bring growing demand for bank credit. While there is no doubt that balance of payments develop ments during the first five months have been encouraging, especially as they point to a considerable degree of long term improvement, the outlook is clouded by at least two very sobering considerations. In the first place, a declining tendency in the trade surplus, a substantial increase in new foreign security issues in the last couple of months, and the pronounced tendency toward higher interest rates in Europe point to the possibility of a widening deficit over the remainder of the year. Secondly, we cannot look with compla cency o. a deficit for the year in the range of $1.5 to $2 billion---for, in this seventh year of major deficits, the possibilities for orderly financing of such a sizable gap are becoming ever more difficult, and our bargaining position in international financial matters has been demonstrably weekened as our cumulative deficit has grown. We cannot afford to let this situation continue for long without taking decisive steps to check it. These considerations, plus the ever present possibility that further business expansion could produce stronger infla tionary pressures, and the inevitabilicy of some lag between any action we might take and any substantial effects on the economy, suggest that the System should, at the very least, be poised for action as developments unfold. Unfortunately, we are entering a period when Treasury financing operations are likely to complicate our policy decisions, but at the mo ment the schedule of such operations is. still quite uncertain. There is a free period for the next ten days or so, but by the end of this month the Treasury may be announcing some financing plans that would call for maintenance of an \"even keel\" through much of July. By late July, the Treasury would presumably be announcing the terms of its August re funding--or whatever remained of that refunding, in the event that part of the August maturities were pre-refunded in July. I am inclined to think that the balance of payments outlook would justify our taking a clear step toward less credit ease at this time. On the other hand, I frankly admit the difficulty of obtaining much public support for such a move in the virtual absence of immediate inflationary developments here in this country and against the background 6/17/64 -25 of the favorable first quarter balance of payments. Also the imminence of Treasury financing is an important inhibiting factor. Thus, I am led to the reluctant conclusion that we should stay our hand, insofar as an immediate policy move is concerned. It would, of course, be much more satisfactory if we could take advantage, for international purposes, of a natural tendency for interest rates to harden as domestic credit demands increase. Hopefully this may occur. I think I would confine changes in the directive to some recognition in the first paragraph of the further improvement in the business outlook, an improved unemployment situation, and the growing doubt on the international payments position for the remainder of the year. The staff\\'s draft directive seems to cover these points admirably. It would seem, however, that there is some room for keeping a firmer rein on the money market, or in other words \"resolving doubts on the side of less ease,\" while still working within the terms of the current directive. In particular, I would hope that the Committee might overcome its apparent reluctance to see net borrowed reserves appear occasionally in our weekly reports. While I would not aim deliberately at net borrowed reserves, I would think in terms of a target of zero to $100 million, with occasional swings outside of this area on both sides. As long as the current prejudice against ever showing a negative reserve figure prevails, the Desk will inevitably be forced to avoid the lower part of our target range, with a resulting tendency toward too much ease. Over the last year or so we have succeeded in persuading the market that substantial week-to week swings in the free reserve figure do not ordinarily point to a change in monetary policy. I would hope that similarly we might \"educate\" the markec to the view that an occasional lapse below zero is likewise without policy significance. Since our next policy move might well be in the direction of less rather than greater ease, more widely fluctuating reserve figures now would minimize expec tational reactions to such a move if and when it comes. In light of rate trends abroad, I think we should continue to keep the bill rate under close surveillance, and it would certainly be desirable to see it move five or ten points higher if this can be accomplished without an excessively tight money market. It is clearly too soon to be thinking of a discount rate change. 6/17/64 -26 I might take this occasion to invite your attention once again to the pressing need for some liberalization in maximum rates of interest under Regulation Q. For many months now the market rate on longer terms of certificates of deposit has been at or near the 4 per cent liit; and the 3-1/2 per cent savings deposit maximum (except as to long-term deposits) is working a real hardship on New York commercial banks who are competing with the prevailing 4-1/4 per cent rate offered by mutual savings banks. Mr. Ellis reported that \"steady progress\" described the course of the New England economy in the recent period. Manufacturing output rose more than seasonally in April. Seasorally adjusted factory employment also rose a bit in that month, contrary to recent history. Unemployment had dropped sharply, as evidenced by data on unemploy ment compensation claims, and income had been rising steadily. Mary farmers had concluded that potatoes would never again reach $5 a barrel and had sold their stored supply. Recently, with the supply running short, those farmers who still had potatoes got $6 or more per barrel, and some of the District banks had collected loans they had written off. However, many farmers had now increased their planting; and might be expected to show less of a profit. Recent trends at District banks were continuing, Mr. Ellis said. Real estate loans were rising rapidly, loans to brokers and dealers were contracting sharply, and there was continued rapid growth in time and savings deposits. Several mutual savings banks had announced higher rates on 90-day savings deposits. 6/17/64 -27 Mr. Ellis said that the principal theme he detected in the national indicators was of a strengthening economy in a balanced expansion, without widespread price advance. As Mr. Noyes had noted, this had been the immediate objective of monetary policy, so the Committee\\'s policy must have been appropriate to the economy. The question the Committee must resolve now was how long this policy would remain appropriate. In reaching such a judgment, the Committee should take into account that bank loans, especially business loans, had expanded more rapidly in May than in either the first four months of the year or the comparable period of last year. The initiative fcr credit creation seemed to be shifting to business; there had been slackened growth in bank holdings of municipals and a cut-back in their holdings of Governments. Mr. Ellis commented that like Mr. Noyes he, too, occasionally looked back in the minutes of the Comnittee to check on the positions he had taken earlier. He found that for some time he had been ad vocating an occasional negative reserve pos.tion. But since net borrowed reserves had been avoided for so lcng, their appearance now undoubtedly would be regarded by the market as an intentional, aggressive move by the Committee, and not as an accident. This would be particularly likely at the present time, given the May declines in total reserves and the money supply. It seemed that the Committee could not now do what he had been urging earlier. The possible 6/17/64 -28 Treasury financing also was a consideration at present. On that note, Mr. Ellis said, he would endorse both paragraphs of the draft directive prepared by the staff. Mr. Irons reported that conditions in the Eleventh District had shown moderate expansion during the past several weeks and he thought the indications were for further improvement in coming months. In spite of the high level of activity in many economic sectors of the District, there were no serious indications of unsustainable or excessive expansion. Also, Mr. Irons noted, there were some areas of weakness in the District economy. Inventories of crude oil were excessive and allowables were being reduced, and some petroleum product prices were not strong. There was some softness ir agricultural prices, including cattle prices. On the other hand, department store sales were at an all time high, construction activity continued to break records, employment and industrial production were edging up, and unemploynent was not as high as it had been. In the financial area, Mr. Irons said, loans in all catego ries, investmerts, and time and savings deposits at District banks all were up in the recent period, but demand deposits had declined. While loan demand was satisfactory enough, the banks would prefer to see it stronger. District banks had been buying Federal funds on balance, and borrowings at the Dallas Bank had been gyrating, 6/17/64 -29 depending upon whether some of the large banks came in for a few days or not. A somewhat larger number of banks, particularly smaller ones, were coming to the discount window. It was his expectation that even without much tightening of credit there might be more active discounting, and more problems in administering the discount window. Banks were less liquid than a year ago, and an increasing number of relatively small country banks were running reserve deficiencies. Upon checking, these were found to be putting more of their funds into the Federal funds market and keeping more fully invested in general. For a long time the excess reserves of the District\\'s country banks had ranged from about 12 to 14 per cent of requirements, but these percentages had now dropped down to a 6 - 8 per cent range. Mr. Irons said that in his judgment neither domestic nor foreign conditons warranted a change in policy at this time. The domestic situation was strong but it was not running away. The foreign situation appeared less favorable in the past few weeks than earlier, but he had some reservations regarding the quality of the preliminary data that were gathered, and thought it would be well to wait until more reliable figures were available. The fact that the Treasury was in the picture was another reason why it was not desirable to change policy. 6/17/64 -30 Mr. Irons thought recent policy had been quite satisfactory. There might have been a slight firming during the past few weeks, and if so that was agreeable with him. He hoped emphasis would be placed on money market conditions--on tone and feel--and that there would not be so much emphasis on free reserve figures. It was unfortunate that the Committee had built a halo around free reserves, but this probably was not the time to change the whole concept. Free reserves might be somewhere around $100 million, but he would not be worried if the figure dropped lower. He hoped that some way might be found to discourage the market from thinking that an occasional net borrowed reserve figure would necessarily indicate a change in policy. Mr. Irons favored a Federal funds rate at or about the dis count rate, the bill rate within 5 to 7 basis points of the discount rate, and member bank borrowings in the $200-$300 million range. Mr. Irons did not think it practical to change policy, and he would not change the discount rate at this time. He was willing to renew the directive now in effect, but he also found the staff draft acceptable. Mr. Swan reported that the economic situation in the Twelfth District continued to be satisfactory. Of course, employment in defense activities continued to decline, but there had been some gain, primarily of a seasonal nature, in total employment in California, 6/17/64 -31 Washington, and Utah in April and May. At the same time, however, the labor force increased more than seasonally; therefore, in con trast to the country as a whole, there was a slight increase in unemployment. Lumber production was still somewhat constrained by high inventories. The nonferrous metals situation was quite strong, and the demanc\\' for petroleum had outrun the District\\'s production. The San Francisco Bank had held a business outlook conference early in June, Mr. Swan said, which was attended by executives from a variety of industries throughout the District. They discussed their particular industries rather than the over-all outlook, but the sum of their views followed quite closely the standard assessment of prospects for the country as a whole. They foresaw a continued rise in consumer buying and reasonable stability in prices. They mentioned a widespread tendency for consumers to upgrade purchases in all lines. Wage increases in the District were being accompanied by further increases in productivity, and inventory changes were expected to continue to be closely related to changes, in sales rather than to anticipated price increases. They foresaw a leveling off in residen tial construction, but a continuing and perhaps protracted rise in plant and equipment spending. Even in the defense area, the expecta tion was that there would not be precipitous declines in employment. The continuation of some special problems in California agriculture 6/17/64 -32 was anticipated--including rising unit labor costs, loss of prime land to urban encroachment, and rather heavy credit needs to finance purchases of equipment, expecially by fruit and vegetable growers, as mechanization was extended. Bank loan demand continued to be quite satisfactory in the Twelfth District, as elsewhere, Mr. Swan said. City banks had been under considerable pressure in the latter part of May but in the two weeks ending June 10 they were in a much easier position. The net inflow of funds to savings and loan associations in the first four months of this year was 30 per cent less than in the same period in 1963. Mr. Swan said he could see no basis for any change in policy at this time, in view of the nature of the business advance and in light of the very moderate growth over the first five months of 1964 in reserves, bank credit, and in money supply, and the actual declines in some cases in May. Granting that the international situation was uncertain at this point and perhaps less favorable than earlier, he did not think it provided a basis for a less easy policy as yet. With respect to the question of market reactions to free reserve figures, Mr. Swan noted that there had been some sizable fluctuations over the past few weeks. It seemed to him that the figure had come rather close to being negative when it dipped to $32 million, and perhaps that accomplished whatever might have been 6/17/64 -33 expected from a negative figure. He would like to see free reserves stay around $100 million, and, if possible, member bank borrowing between $200-$300 million. Mr. Swan said he was quite willing to accept the draft directive prepared by the staff. He thought the proposed changes in language from the previous directive recognized significant changes; that had occurred in the national situation during the last three weeks. However, he questioned the desirability of applying the word \"deterioration\" to the balance of payments, in view of developments in May and early June relative to April. He would rather say \"less favorable\" in describing the payments situation. Mr. Deming said he had little new to report for the Ninth District. Conditions were going along much like those of the nation. The severe floods in Montana last week had caused fairly serious damage and might have some impact on agriculture in the State. As a result of the general rains, however, crop prospects for the District as a whole now were good; until a short time ago, there had been concern about dryness. Mr. Deming observed that Mr. Holland\\'s description of the national banking situation applied to the Ninth District also. As Mr. Irons had noted for the Eleventh District, country banks were borrowing at the discount window more often. The loan-deposit ratio for District country banks had reached the highest point in four years, 6/17/64 -34 and they evidently were in a tighter position than had been thought. City banks did not seem to be in a tight position. Mr. Deming favored no change in policy during the coming period. Like Mr. Noyes, he found it difficult to uncover anything very wrong with the national economic picture and liked to think that monetary policy had contributed to this result. Mr. Scanlon commented that business trends in the Seventh District continued generally favorable. District producers of capital goods reported that orders for machinery and equipment were continuing to rise and that the current estimate of a 12 per cent rise in plant and equipment expenditures this year might be too low. Demand for farm machinery was continuing at a rate 5 to 10 per cent above last year, but analysts for various firms differed as to whether this pace would continue in the face of lower farm income. The paper industry, currently operating close to capacity, was undertaking expansion programs which some industry analysts ex pected would again create problems of excess capacity possibly befo.e the end of 1965. A large and diversified Midwest producer of chem icals reported that although the firm\\'s over-all output was equal to only 85 per cent of capacity, facilities to produce a number of important products were being operated at virtual capacity. Unu sually large inter-regional shipments had been necessary to balance supplies. Nevertheless, Mr. Scanlon said, average prices received 6/17/64 -35- by this firm for chemicals in the first quarter were only 1 per cent above the average for the fourth quarter of 1963 and were 3 per cent below the level of a year earlier. Mr. Scanlon said a survey of large employers by his Bank\\'s research department revealed that most of these firms were expe riencing difficulty in recruiting adequate staffs even though unemployment rates were still above those of the mid-fifties. The labor supply was being increased appreciably by larger high school graduating classes this month, but large employers of office workers reported tha: experienced persons were still in short supply. A large Chicago area steel firm reported a substantial number of unfilled positions (equal to 1.5 per cent of its work force) not all of which required previously acquired skills. This firm con tinued to require that new employees be high school graduates, however. In the case of skilled metal-working trades--machinists, welders, tool makers, and the like--shortages of workers were reported generally by Midwest firms. Mr. Scanlon reported that total loan demand at District banks in recent weeks, as in the nation, had been dominated by expansion of loans to security dealers. Although business loans at banks in the District\\'s major cities had risen somewhat since the end of April (compared with a decline in the same period of last year) demand had been slightly less strong than in the nation. 6/17/64 -36- Reserve positions of Chicago banks were tighter than in late April and early May. This development had been accompanied by a decline in demand deposits and a rise in holdings of Treasury bills. Most of the reserve needs of these banks had been covered by pur chasing Federal funds. Outstanding CDs of Chicago banks were now above $1 billion, and at a new high, and a large proportion of these would mature in June and July. Mr. Scanlon felt that the recent posture of policy had been about right and that it should not be changed at this time. He did not favor changing the discount rate, and the draft directive was generally satisfactory to him. Apropos Mr. Swan\\'s suggested wording change, he said that he found it difficult to differentiate between the words \"deterioration\" and \"less favorable.\" Mr. Clay noted that the recent performance of the domestic economy had been quite encouraging. It had shown a balanced, orderly expansion in activity with the average level of prices remaining essentially unchanged. This performace, however, was simply the kind of development that had been sought as a necessary step toward the economic growth and fuller utilization of resources that was the goal of public policy. In Mr. Clay\\'s opinion, these domestic developments were compatible with a continuation of the same monetary policy that the Committee had been pursuing. This called for money market conditions 6/17/64 -37 remaining essentially unchanged and for reserve expansion sufficient to permit a moderate rate of growth in commercial bank credit on a seasonally adjusted basis. Mr. Clay thought that purchases should be made in longer maturities to the extent necessary to provide reserve expansion if operations in Treasury bills would put undue downward pressue on Treasury bill yields for international payments purposes. However, the range of maturities within which operations were conducted might be conditioned by the nature of any Treasury financing. The substance of the current economic policy directive would serve satisfactorily for the period immediately ahead, Mr. Clay said. The implementation paragraph was entirely appropriate in its present form, except for a reference to possible Treasury financing, but the first paragraph should be rewritten to reflect current economic con ditions more accurately. It was his opinion that the first paragraph of the directive adopted at each meeting always should be written specifically for that meeting, as had been done very recently, rather than being readopted from the previous directive. In that way, the background statement of the directive would apply to the current situation to a degree that was not likely to prevail otherwise. It was highly probable, Mr. Clay said, that these fresh background statements for the directives would make for a stronger and more impressive public record of Committee policy actions. The staff 6/17/64 -38 draft suggested for the economic policy directive for the period immediately ahead appeared to him to be quite appropriate. Mr. Clay favored no change in the Federal Reserve Bank discount rate. Mr. Wayne reported that business activity in the Fifth Dis trict continued to improve, but the rate of increase had apparently slackened a little, and some new uncertainties had developed. Respondents to the Bank\\'s latest survey were considerably less optimistic t an they had been a few weeks ago. Reports from nondu rable goods manufacturers were mixed as usual, but the balance in new orders, backlogs, and shipments was slightly on the down side. The latest figures on nonfarm employment and manufacturing man-hours showed some .light declines. Problems of seasonal adjustment might distort this picture to some extent, but i: did appear that some real abatement had occurred. Retail trade, however, continued to improve more than seasonally during May, according to both the department store statistics and the survey returns. The textile business con tinued generally strong, but the recently announced decision governing cotton price equalization payments had prolonged and might further complicate price and product uncertainties already present. The prosperous furniture industry appeared to have reached a plateau, possibly a temporary one, with sales at retail reportedly down a little in May. The construction industry continued to operate at or close to capacity, and the flow of new business remained heavy. 6/17/64 -39 In agriculture, up until the last three dys, lack of rain in some areas seemed to be developing into a problem again this year. Nationally, the economy was performing well, Mr. Wayne said, and the pace of activity seemed to be accelerating moderately. So far as he could see at this time, it was a well-balanced expansion with no significant bottlenecks and no overheating. Especially impressive had been the large increase in employment in recent months, the drop in unemployment in May, the sharp rise in manufacturers\\' new and unfilled orders in April, and the continued rapid climb in ma chine tool orders. These had been accompanied by slowly rising retail sales and continued high levels of activity in construction and in the production and sale of automobiles. This heightened rate of economic activity, apparently stemming in considerable part from the tax reduction of three months ago, had been initiated and main tained with hardly a ripple in the general price indexes. There might be pitfalls ahead which were not apparent now, but thus far the attempt to provide a major stimulus to the economy by fiscal means seemed to be proceeding on beam and on schedule and without the price disturbances which many had feared. In the matter of policy, Mr. Wayne saw no reason for any change at this time. Under the policy the Committee had followed in recent months the economy seemed to be making as much progress as could reasonably be expected. While credit had been available in 6/17/64 -40- adequate amounts, increases in bank credit and the money supply had certainly not. been excessive. In fact, both the money supply and the turnover of demand deposits declined in May. And the rate of growth in the money supply in the past five months had been only about half the rate of the previous six months. The continued stability of prices was additional evidence that there was no excess of purchasing power in the economy. So long as basic conditions remained as good as they now appeared to be, Mr. Wayne would favor keeping the present policy. He would keep the discount rate where it was. The draft directive was acceptable to him. Mr. Mills made the following statement: Even if proof of a pegged market for U.S. Government securities were needed, the operation of the System Open Market Account for the last three weeks has clearly exposed its existence even to the uninitiated. The average yield on short-term Treasury bills continued to be immobilized during this period at just under 3.50 per cent at the same time that market pressures which could not be softened by purchases of coupon U.S. Government securities caused longer term interest rates to strengthen. These devel opments occurred in the climate of a falling tendency of total reserves and a definite reduction in the level of free reserves. In effect, pegging the short-term structure of interest rates through Federal Reserve System actions was at the expense of imposing contractive pressures on the expansion of commercial bank credit. The clearest evidence of these pressures has been revealed in the commercial banking system\\'s reduction of its holdings of U.S. Government securities at a time of a relatively slack demand for credit other than the financing of securities dealers. The tight position of the commercial banking system would have been more apparent except that it has been glossed over by the constant increase in outstanding nego tiable time certificates of deposit. Inasmuch as these 6/17/64 -41- instruments are a form of direct borrowing by the issuing banks, it follows that the rising total of negotiable time certifi:ates of deposit, in effect, covers over what would otherwise be a readily discernible tightness in the commer cial banking system. In short, the Federal Reserve System\\'s monetary and credit policy is exerting undue restraint over the expansion of credit and at the expense and risk of throttling down national economic activity under conditions when the absence of pronounced inflationary pressures have not called for such action. The laggardly increase occur ring in the money supply is a still further indication of the restraining effects of the System\\'s monetary and credit policy. There are those that may argue the case for maintaining a stron interest rate posture on the grounds that interest rates are rising abroad as many foreign countries bring up their interest rate structures in order to combat domestic inflationary conditions and, therefore, it is necessary to maintain a level of interest rates in the United States high enough to prevent an outflow of funds attracted by the higher interest rate yields obtainable in many foreign countries. However, this reasoning neglects the fact that inflationary conditions abroad reflect unsound fiscal and monetary management which has weakened the exchange values of many foreign currencies and thereby has shown up the risks involved in their acquisition purely because of interest rate incentives. Instead of United States funds moving abroad under present conditions, there is apt to be a return flow. If, in the rather unlikely event United States funds should flow out merely in order to capture higher interest rates for their holders, resistance to such outflow; should take the form of fiscal measures and not of monetary actions taken at the expense of weakening the domestic economy. Under the circumstances that have developed since the Committee\\'s last meeting, my reservations regarding its instructions to the Manager of the System Open Market Account were well taken in that during this period monetary and credit policy has moved perceptibly toward more restraint. A continuance of similar policy actions will have dangerous cumulative effects and corrective action should be taken promptly to supply the commercial banking system with reserves more freely than has been the case. 6/17/64 -42 Mr. Mills added that he strongly urged the Committee to consider the actions taken since the last meeting by the Account Management to have been at fault in carrying out the Committee\\'s policy. Mr. Robertson made the following statement: The general business advance seems to me to be continuing to develop in a manner that is compatible with our present monetary policy. By that I mean not so slowly as to require any more aggressive monetary stimulus than we have been pro viding, but also without the kind of inflationary ebullience that would call for any move toward monetary restraint. It is gratifying to see the solid improvement in our use of real resources that is being signalled by the increases in the production index and the employment figures. I hope that they can continue, and I think our monetary policy should actively accommodate such further advances, so long as inflation remains conspicuously abnent. I see no developments on the international front that should inhibit such a policy. The seesaw movements of component:s of our international capital flows over the past three months do not, in my opinion, reflect responses to interest rate differentials that cculd or should be closed by a less easy United States monetary policy. In so far as bank loans to foreigners are concerned, I am impressed with the evidence cited by Mr. Furth that a relatively small number of banks is contributing the bulk of such increased lending. I take this as confirmation of the idea that such lending is still too narrowly confined to warrant changes in nation-wide monetary policy in order to affect it. If it is to be dealt with at all, it should be by more selective means. As for the trade portion of our payments balance, I note that our surplus is still large, even though down from its cyclical peak. I believe the most we ought to do with monetary policy in this area is to promote further noninflationary domestic business expansion. With these broad policy objectives in mind, I favor operations by the Desk to continue to foster money supply expansion at least as strong or perhaps even stronger than the average since December, with attendant bank credit growth 6/17/64 -43- about like we have had thus far this year. It may be somewhat harder to attain this money supply growth over the next month or so, because of the dampening influence of the expected build-up in Government deposits in June and the possible package of Treasury financing in July. Accordingly, I would favor money market conditions and free reserve levels more like the average that prevailed in May, rather than the somewhat tauter conditions characteristic of the first half of Jure. I hope that post-tax-date developments will give the Manager the opportunity to re-establish the earlier climate, and I urge that he be instructed to take every opportunity to do so. In other words, in the prospective environment of the next few weeks, I think doubts should be resolved on the side of ease. As for the directive, I see no pressing need to change it. I have some preference for changing the reference to foreign irterest rates from \"advances\" to \"movements\" in order not to seem ignorant of the fact that the bill rate trend in Canada has been downward, not upward. Similarly, in the second paragraph, I have a preference for changing the money market reference period from \"recent weeks\" to \"the month of May\" in order to make clear the intention of not continuing the slightly tighter feeling of early June. But these are nuances, and I would not resist continuation of the directive as is. Having thus expressed my view as to the instructions we should convey to the Desk today, I want to say a word or two about the communications aspects of the daily con ference telephone call with the Desk. It was exactly ten years ago last month that the morring call procedure was first established, and I believe the first suggestion for such a procedure was mine. Many of the present members of this Committee were not here then, and may not be aware of the historical setting of this arrangement, and that is what leads me to make these remarks. From its inception, the \"call\" has had as its basic purpose the exchange of information. It was not conceived as an instrument for giving guidance to the Manager, for urging personal views upon him, or for detracting in any way from his sole and direct responsibility for the conduct of operations between meetings. The call has evolved since that time, both in terms of the comprehensiveness of its contents and its rotation among the President members of the Committee. Information that I 6/17/64 -44- assume is quite useful to the Desk is reported by the Board staff and by the participating President. But information is one thing, and policy guidance is another. I know that the spokesman for the Desk on the call is always careful to ask for comments on the intended program from any Federal Open Market Committee member who is participating. This is most courteous of the Desk, and I can imagine the Manager is occasionally helped by others\\' interpretation of what the Committee intended at its last meeting. But I think it behooves each one of us, when we reply to the Desk\\'s invita tion to comment (if we do), to be very careful to speak in terms of the Committee consensus and not our own positions- whatever they may be--and, furthermore, to speak with a view to aiding the Manager in reaching his own decision rather than endeavoring to override or even influence it. Call procedures, of course, can be anything the Committee wants them to be. This group is perfectly free to change them at this meeting or any other. But until such time as a change is officially voted by the Committee, I think we should all make sure that our participation in the call is in accordance with the established rules of the game. Mr. Shepardson said he did not think he could add significantly to the comments that had been made about the general condition of the economy. The advance was moving in a sustained way that he found satisfactory. Like Mr. Ellis, he had been poised for a long time against the conditions he thought were approaching. Reports of what was going on in the labor area indicated that pressures might develop which would bring the outbreak of price increases that the Committee had been concerned about. He continued to feel that the Committee should keep itself in position to move as early as the situation seemed to justify toward restraining inflationary pressures before they got out of hand. The desirability of greater fluctuation. in free reserve figures had been mentioned, Mr. Shepardson continued, including a possible dip 6/17/64 -45 below zero from time to time. The figures for the last few weeks indicated that there already had been a good deal of fluctuation. For example, the figure for last week was down to $32 million, and this morning the projection for the current week was back up to $186 million. It seemed to him that if the figure happened to go to zero or below the fluctuation would be within a pattern that already had been established and would not be detrimental. Mr. Shepardson thought that the operations of the Desk in the last three weeks had accomplished what the Committee had desired. He favored maintaining about the same money market conditions and the degree of ease that had prevailed in the past three weeks. In his judgment, continued fluctuation in free reserves would be helpful. He approved the draft directive that had been distributed to the Committee before the meeting. Mr. Mitchell commented that he also was uneasy about some of the things that Mr. Mills found disturbing. He thought the point that several people had mentioned--that banks were in a tight position--was more real than the Committee had realied. The tightness had resulted from the efforts of banks to justify paying 4 per cent for CD money by rearranging their portfolios, and they had about reached the end of the line in this connection. Although there was some evidence of increased loan demand, an upsurge in business borrowing had not yet occurred, and if one developed banks would have little room left to 6/17/64 -46- meet it. Mr. Mitchell thought that the Committee would have to be prepared to accommodate it--and not grudgingly--if there was to be a lift in the tempo of activity. The second thing that concerned him, Mr. Mitchell said, was the money supply. While he was not of the school that considered the money supply the only variable of impor:ance in monetary policy, he did not think the Committee could afford to disregard its behavior over an extended period. According to the revised figures, the money supply increased at a 4 per cent rate in the second half of 1963, but had risen at only a 2 per cent rate so far this year. There were various signs indicating that the economy was straining to live with the money supply the Committee was providing. For one thing, turnover, while down slightly in May, was above the level of last year; users were having to economize on money. Even more persuasive was the behavior of the currency component of the money supply, Mr. Mitchell said. Currency increased at rates of 6.1 and 6.7 per cent, respectively, in the last five months of 1903 and so far this year, while demand deposits rose at rates of 2.6 and 1.2 per cent in those two periods. It was not certain that this differential behavior was a cause for alarm but it suggested to him that the economy was not being provided with enough money. Mr. Mitchell said he was not deeply alarmed about the recent trend in the money supply, but he would become so if the same trend 6/17/64 -47 continued for long. He could not say what the right rate of growth was but he would feel more comfortable with a 4 per cent rate than with 2 per cent. Mr. Mitchell agreed with Mr. Hayes that the balance of pay ments problem was worrisome. He did not find the decline in the trade balance discouraging; the first quarter trade surplus was larger than anyone had a right to expect, end the present level of the surplus was more in line with reasonable expectations. The balance of payments problem, in his judgment, was largely a matter of capital outflows, and like Mr. Robertson he thought selective measures should be used to deal with it. Banks obviously were contributing substan tially to the outflows, and should be brought under the interest equalization tax. He did not think monetary policy was the answer. The Committee should be trying to insure that the tax cut would raise the domestic growth rate and would reduce unemployment from its present leve , which most countries would regard as intolerable. Referring to Mr. Mills\\' comments on the evidences of tight ness in the past three weeks, Mr. Mitchell noted that the Account Management had undershot the target of $100 million for free reserves in four out of the past six periods. He was not critical of the Manager; the way to deal with this problem, he thought was to fix the free reserve target at $200 million. 6/17/64 -48- Mr. Mitchell expressed satisfaction with the directive that the staff had drafted. He would like to have more attention given to monetary expansion, and he thought that would be accomplished by the higher free reserve target he had suggested. Mr. Hickman said the highlight of the business news in May was the sharp rise in retail sales complemented by a further appre ciable increase in industrial production. This was the first month since the tax cut that there were pronounced increases in both pro duction and sales, he noted. Recent developments in the Fourth District indicated a continuation of a moderate, balanced improvement in business, Mr. Hickman said. Steel production increased slightly in the District in the most recent three weeks in contrast to a small decline in the nation. Steel producers who reported to the Cleveland Bank indicated that demand for steel was strong, although June orders, seasonally adjusted, were expected to be slightly below those of May, and markedly below orders in April. The seasonally adjusted rate of insured unemployment continued to decline during the most recent three-week period in almost all major labor markets of the District except Cleveland, where work stoppages among construction workers depressed employment. It was perhaps worth noting in passing that settlements recently reached in several of the building trades in Cleveland were quite generous and far exceeded the Administration\\'s 6/17/64 -49- guidelines. Several local major construction projects might be postponed because of higher breakeven points. At the board meeting of the Cleveland Bank last week, the directors seemed to feel that, notwithstanding the record level of retail sale; in May, the closing of many retail outlets on Memorial Day, which was a Saturday, might have deferred some demand until June. This would, of course, help to increase retail sales in June, perhaps somewhat similarly to the way in which the figures for February were helped by the five Saturdays in that month. The sharp recovery in Fourth District department store sales in the week ended June 6 lent some credence to this opinion. Perhaps further basic statistical work might be justified on trading-day, holiday and Saturday adjustments of the retail sales data. Sim ilarly, the strength in industrial production in the first half of each of the four years 1961 to date suggested possible review of the seasonal pattern of that index. Mr. Hickman continued to be disturbed by the widening spreads between interest rates here and abroad. The latest discount rate increases in Holland and Denmark, as well as possible similar steps or a firming of rates in London and elsewhere, might add further to the imbalance in rates between the United States and other countries, he said. Europeans, with their vivid experiences with inflation, were not disposed to overlook the classical remedies for fighting inflation and balance of payments difficulties. 6/17/64 -50- This led Mr. Hickman once again to urge that the Committee and the Treasury reappraise the international financial position. The present domestic economic situation did not indicate the need at this time for added stimulus through monetary means. A minor firming of rates in this country would not check the balanced business expansion, but might help the international position of the United States. So far as recent figures on credit availability were con cerned, Mr. Hickman said, there seemed to have been a close conformity to the Committee\\'s intent, allowing for the usual errors in reserve estimates. On the other hand, the money market had continued slightly easier than he thought desirable. Projections of free reserves suggested wide swings over the next three weeks, which might make the reserve estimates more unreliable than usual. This being the case, Mr. Hickman said, the Desk should probably be guided more by the volume of borrowings and the feel of the market than by the usual marginal and aggregate reserve measures. United States monetary posture here and abroad could, in Mr. Hickman\\'s opinion, be improved if the 91-day bill rate rose slightly further and then fluctuated within the 3.50-3.60 per cent range, and the rate on long-term Governments moved gradually upward to 4.20 per cent from the 4.15 per cent level where it had held for the past few weeks. In addition, Mr. Hickman commented, the Special Manager, 6/17/64 -51 Mr. Coombs, might wish to consider whether anything further could be done in the forward markets to reduce the covered differentials that now existed in favor of London and Montreal. Perhaps the Treasury might wish to consider offering a strip of bills, in addition to increasing the regular weekly offerings, and some possible debt lengthening. Mr. Hickman said that he would not recommend an increase in the discount rate at this time, and it fact, would seek to avoid such an increase by forehanded action. He liked the revisions of the current economic policy directive suggested by the staff, al though he thought the reference to unemployment might be premature in view of the large number of teenagers who had probably already entered the labor force. In a concluding comment, Mr. Hickman said he was particularly appreciative of the guidance Mr. Robertson had provided with respect to the morning calls. In the one period during which he had partic ipated in the call he had noted some exchanges that seemed to him to border on harrassment of the Manager. Mr. Bopp said that business was gcod in the Third District. Labor demand and the status of the labor force remained strong or improving. Unemployment claims (Pennsylvania and Delaware) had been low all year, and remained so; unemployment rates were decreasing in most of the District\\'s labor markets; and help-vanted indicators were strong in most cities of the District. 6/17/64 -52 Output appeared reasonably vigorous. Electric power consump tion by District manufacturing industries increased steadily from January through April. Manufacturing employment had increased very slowly, however, and had failed to match national increases. Department store sales relative to 1963 totals equaled the national advance. However, sales in the District were being compared to abnormally low levels in 1963. Since the Committee\\'s last meeting, Mr. Bopp said, reserve pressures on District member banks had diminished somewhat and loans continued to rise. The basic reserve deficit of Reserve city banks averaged around $28 million during the three weeks ending June 10. This compared to an average deficit of $63 million in the preceding three-week period. Borrowing at the discount window continued to be relatively Light. Business loans at weekly reporting member banks during the same three-week period rose $9 million, compared to a $3 million decline last year. Both business loans aid net loans adjusted con tinued to run well above last year. Recent economic developments, in Mr. Bopp\\'s judgment, provided little evidence to support a move toward monetary restraint. It was true that inventories, retail sales, and capital spending plans had all risen. But inventory policies remained quite conservative and near-term business and consumer spending showed little probability 6/17/64 -53 of pressing upon productive capacity. The fact that prices had been so steady reflected the ability of business to meet demand without encountering pressures on capacity. As for the labor market, he was, of course, happy to see the recent decline in unemployment. Never theless, the percentage of unemployed still remained high and the decline in the percentage stemmed partly from relative stability in the labor force, a condition which might already have been upset. On the international front, Mr. Bopp continued to be impressed by the stability of unit labor costs in this country. He thought that so long as American costs remained under control the basic deficit was likely to remain within manageable proportions. It would be important, of course, to watch flows of short-term capital closely, especially with some interest rates rising abroad. In line with this view of the domestic and international situations, Mr. Bopp had some reservations about the recent trend of reserve availability and the money supply. With bank liquidity de clining and with possibilities for increased demand for credit as the economy expanded, he was inclined to resolve doubts on the easier side. The proposed directive appeared appropriate and he would not change the discount rate. Mr. Bryan commented that in terms of many statistical series the Sixth District seemed to be doing less well than the nation as a whole. The series in which the District was doing better seemed to be almost entirely in the financial area. 6/17/64 -54- As for the national economy and monetary policy, Mr. Bryan said he had come to the meeting today with a rather changed attitude of mind. Others had spoken well on the question of the money supply. What troubled him, however, was the behavior not of the money supply but of the reserve series. He did not want to associate himself in any way with those who charged the Committee with the strangulation of the economy. But looking forward, he thought the Committee was headed for trouble very soon if aggregate reserves were to continue to expand only at the recent rate, because the economy was outpacing the supply of reserve funds that were being created. Accordingly, he felt as some others did, that doubts should be resolved in the direction of supplying additional amounts of reserves. In terms of a free reserve figure, Hr. Bryan said he placed his target for the next three weeks at $150 nillion, with, of course, allowance for latitude on the part of the Manager In terms of aggregate reserves he thought that the target, at a minimum, should be a 3 per cent rate of growth, and his personal preference was nearer to a 4 per cent rate. Mr. Bryan said he was as alarmed about the balance of payments problem as anyone else around the table, but he continued to think that the Committee could make only a minor contribution to its solution. For monetary policy to make a major contribution, a deflation of the U. S. economy would be required of such proportions as to be neither desirable nor tolerable. 6/17/64 -55 Mr. Shuford said that business activity in the Eighth District, in contrast to the nation, had shown little change since late last year. This was not to be taken as disturbing, since activity was at a relatively high level, but the District certainly had not had the same expansion as the nation. Employment had shown a downward drift recently, and value added in manufacturing and bank debits had changed little since last year. On the other hand, business loans had risen markedly since April, with major gains in the categories of construc tion, retail trade, and durable goods manufacturing. Mr. Shuford said he favored no change in policy. The national situation had been covered adequately this morning; in summary, the economy was continuing to expand at a reasonable rate, with the major indexes either rising or remaining at advanced levels. The pace of activity might be accelerating, but the expansion appeared balanced and prices remained steady. The balance of payments situation now perhaps was less favorable than in the earlier part of the year, but at present, the problem did not appear to be of proportions serious enough to call for any change in policy. With respect to monetary developments, Mr. Shuford\\'s view was that they had been reasonably appropriate for the conditions with which the Committee was confronted and had been confronted for months. Reserves had declined a bit recently and so had the money supply, but total reserves nad risen at 1-1/2 per cent rate since December. The 6/17/64 -56 money supply, according to the revised serie., had been rising at 2 per cent rate since last year, somewhat less than he had formerly thought. Certainly, Mr. Shuford said, he was among those who agreed that money does matter; most did, but there were differences of opinion as to how it mattered. He would favor a further moderate growth in the reserve base. While he did not know what growth rate would be best, he would not be disturbed by a continuation of the recent 1-1/2 per cent rate in light of the conditions that had prevailed during the past few months and with the possibility of acceleration. He also would like to see an increase in the money supply, at a rate preferably in the range from 2 to 3-1/2 per cent, but a 4 per cent growth rate would not disturb him. Late last year he had been pleased to see a 4 per cent rate and had not been particularly disturbed by 5 per cent; but when the rate hit 6 per cent he had been happy to see it recede. It seemed to Mr. Shuford that the Desk had observed the directive in the past 3 weeks and had maintained about the same conditions in the money market. He would continue the same policy and would expect this to result in continued moderate growth in the reserve base and in a reasonable increase in the money supply. He favored no change in the discount rate, and he thought the draft directive was acceptable, with the substitution of \"less favorable\" for \"deterioration\" in referring to the balance of payments situation. 6/17/64 -57- Chairman Martin, referring to the comments that had been made on the behavior of the money supply, said he did not believe that recent fluctuations had had much impact on developments as yet. He thought Mr. Robertson had made a desirable point in connection with the morning call. In his opinion, however, the business of monetary policy involved harrassment from beginning to end, and anyone who could not take harrassment would be better off outside the field. On policy, the Chairman continued, the problem that weighed most heavily in his thinking at the moment was that of Treasury financing. The Treasury had a difficult row to hoe; all of the debt lengthening that had been accomplished would be lost rapidly if they were unable to move forward. A firming of interest rates would bring rates up against the 4-1/4 per cent ceiling and would require that financing be at the short end of the market. Accordingly, it was his judgment that any move at this juncture toward either an easier or a tighter monetary policy would be a mistake. He hoped the Desk would not have any doubts to resolve, but if it did, unlike Mr. Hayes, he would favor resolving them on the side of ease. Chairman Martin then proposed that the Committee be polled on the basis of no change in policy. It developed that this was the consensus, with Mr. Mills dissenting. Mr. Mills said the difficulty was that if the Committee adopted a policy of no change it had to be no change from some previous position, 6/17/64 -58 and in his judgment the developments of the last three weeks were toward tightening undesirably. Therefore, it was impossible for him to vote for a policy of no change. In voting favorably, Mr. Robertson said he hoped that doubts would be resolved on the side of ease; Mr. Mitchell commented that he assumed the Desk had been trying to do what the Committee wanted even though he personally was unhappy with the results; and Mr. Hickman expressed satisfaction with the recent operations of the Desk. Chairman Martin commented that it should be clear that no one was impugning the Manager\\'s integrity in this matter, but that the members were applying their individual judgments on a subject that was a matter of judgment. Turning to the directive, the Chairman said he thought the draft that the staff had prepared was good. He noted that a number of language changes had been proposed, including a suggestion that the phrase \"less favorable\" rather than the word \"deterioration\" be used in describing the recent performance of the balance of payments. This involved a slight change in emphasis, bit the choice was largely a matter of taste. He, too, would be inclined to make some minor changes if he were writing the directive himself. On the other hand, he thought the text as drafted was satisfactory for its purpose, which was to reflect the Committee\\'s general thinking. As he had said before, words meant different things to different people and they often involved concepts that could not be defined narrowly. It was not likely that a directive could be written that would please everyone. 6/17/64 -59 Chairman Martin then proposed that the Committee vote on adoption of the directive as drafted by the staff, except for the modification he had mentioned in the reference to the balance of payments. Thereupon, upon motion duly made and seconded, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: It is the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s current policy to accommodate moderate growth in the reserve base, bank credit, and the money supply for the purpose of facilitating continued expansion of the economy, while fostering improve ment in the capital account of U. S. international payments, and seeking to avoid the emergence of inflationary pressures. This policy takes into account the recent data on production, actual and planned business capital outlays, retail sales, and unemployment, which indicate some quickening in the pace of domestic expansion. It also gives consideration to the continued relative stability in average commodity prices; the continued underutilization of manpower and other resources; the country\\'s less favorable international payments position thus far in the second quarter; and the interest rate advances over past months in important markets ab::oad. To implement this policy, and taking into account probable Treasury financing activity, System open market operations shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the same conditions in the money market as have prevailed in recent weeks, while accommodating moderate expansion in aggregate bank reserves. Votes for this action: Messrs. Martin, Hayes, Hickman, Mitchell, Robertson, Shepardson, Shuford, Swan, and Wayne. Vote against this action: Mr. Mills. At this point Chairman Martin called for distribution of a memorandum on the Committee\\'s current economic directive that had been 6/17/64 -60 prepared by Messrs. Ellis, Mitchell, and Swan in accordance with a request made by the Committee at its meeting on May 5. (Note: A copy of this memorandum, which was dated June 16, 1964, has been placed in the files of the Committee.) The Chairman then invited Mr. Mitchell to comment. Mr. Mitchell said he thought all of those who had worked on the report had experienced a sense of satisfaction that he hoped the others would share as they read it. It had been a rewarding experience. While the directive problem was a difficult one, it was not intractable; something could be done about it, and he hoped the report represented progress. As the Committee would note, Mr. Mitchell continued, the recom mendations mad were quite specific. The authors did not mean to be dogmatic. They did not feel that the course they recommended was the only possible one, or that it necessarily was the best one; it was simply the best: at which they could arrive. Their objects were to give the Committee some specific proposals to which it could react, and to help create a climate in which desirable changes could evolve. Finally, Mr. Mitchell said, he wanted to note that the Board\\'s staff had worked hard in assisting in the report\\'s preparation. The final document was only about 12 pages long, apart from illustrative material, and he believed the Committee would be interested in reading it. 6/17/64 -61 Chairman Martin said the Committee was indebted to Messrs. Ellis, Mitchell, and Swan, and to the staff, for their work on this report. It was agreed that the report would be discussed by the Committee at the meeting to be held on July 28. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, July 7, 1964, at 9:30 a.m. Thereupon the meeting adjourned. Assistant Secretary ',\n",
       " 'A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held on Tuesday, November 24, 1964, at 3:30 p.m , EST. This was a telephone conference meeting and each individual was in Washing ton except as otherwise indicated in parentheses in the following list of those participating: PRESENT: Mr.  Martin, Chairman Mr.  Hayes, Vice Chairman (New York) Mr.  Balderston Mr.  Daane Mr.  Hickman (Cleveland) Mr. M ills Mr.  Robertson Mr.  Shepardson Mr.  Shuford (St. Louis) Mr.  Swan (San Francisco) Mr. Wayne (Petersburg, Virginia) Mr. Sherman, Assistant Secretary Mr. Broida, Assistant Secretary Mr. Hackley, General Counsel Mr. Brill, Associate Economist Mr. Stone, Manager, System Open Market Account (New York) Mr. Coombs, Special Manager, System Open Market Account (New York) Mr. Molony, Assistant to the Board of Governors Messrs. Katz and Reynolds, Associate Advisers, Division of International Finance, Board of Governors Mr. Furth, Consultant, Board of Governors Miss Eaton, General Assistant, Office of the Secretary, Board of Governors Mr. Sanford, Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (New York) 11/24/64 On the day preceding this meeting, the Bank of England had increased its discount rate from 5 to 7 per cent, and the Board of Governors had taken two actions: (1) it had approved actions by the directors of five Federal Reserve Banks increasing the discount rates of those Banks from 3-1/2 to 4 per cent, effective November 24, 1964, and (2) it had amended the Board\\'s Regulation Q to increase the maximum rates that member banks were permitted to pay on time deposits and on savings deposits held for less than one year, also effective November 24, 1964. Chairman Martin observed that he had called this meeting in light of the Board\\'s actions of the preceding day and in view of .he continuing pressures on the pound in foreign exchange markets that might necessitate some further assistance to the United Kingdom. At the outset, the Chairman said, he wanted to emphasize the need for everyone participating in these discussions to exercise great care to protect the confidentiality of the matters to be discussed and thus avoid contributing to public unrest. He thought the Syst m personnel deserved congratulations on the manner in which the actions of the preceding day had been carried out. The situation was still difficult, however, and it was quite possible that the United Kingdom would need additional assistance in its efforts to defend the pound. A specific purpose of this meeting was to consider whether the Committee would wish to authorize an increase in the 11/24/64 -3- reciprocal currency arrangement with the Bank of England by $250 million to $750 million. The Chairman then asked Mr. Coombs to report the most recent market developments to the Committee and to make any recommendations for Committee action that he thought appropriate. Mr. Coombs reported that both sterling and the dollar had made a reasonably strong showing on the European exchange markets during the morning hours today. Around noon, European time, however, the situation swung around sharply as heavy selling pressure on sterling developed in the continental market centers. The Bank of England had made a firm stand at rates around $2.7860, intervening both in London and New York, but had suffered heavy reserve losses in the process. Reserve losses so far today, Mr. Coombs said, had amounted to $213 million, mainly arising out of intervention opera- tions in London. So far as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of England could tell, there had been no special event today which had triggered this speculative attack. It rather seemed to be rooted in a continued lack of confidence in the ability of the Labor Government to defend sterling. This suspicion of the British Government had been greatly aggravated by widespread resentment in the European business and financial communities over the 15 per cent surcharge placed on British imports near the end of October, 11/24/64 -4- and by widespread rumors of an impending breakdown in political and financial cooperation. As of the moment, the British had now fully utilized not only the $500 million of continental and Canadian central bank credits, but had also drawn the entire $500 million available under the Federal Reserve swap line. Furthermore, Mr. Coombs said, it seemed to be fully accepted not only in European governmental circles but also in the exchange markets that the prospective $1 billion drawing by the British Government on the International Monetary Fund might be utilized to pay off $1 billion in credits obtained by the United Kingdom during the past two months. In effect, therefore, the present credit resources of the British Government had now been exhausted and further intervention to defend sterling would become a charge on the British reserves. The market sensed this situation. The British Government, Mr. Coombs continued, thus faced the prospect of a severe depletion of their already limited reserve availabilities unless the present crisis of confidence could somehow be countered. As he saw it, there were now two main alternatives. First, the British might decide to devalue sterling. This would probably precipitate an international financial crisis of the first magnitude. He would expect to see a major speculative drive on the London gold market and sooner or later an even more 11/24/64 -5 dangerous attack on the U.S. dollar. If the British devaluation were to trigger devaluations of other currencies, such an attack on the U.S. dollar might develop swiftly and in a huge volume. Mr. Coombs thought, therefore, that it was essential to avoid at all costs recourse to the devaluation alternative and to try to deal directly with the confidence factor by putting on a display of international financial cooperation through a new and very large package of short-term credit to the U.K. He thought that the situation was extremely dangerous and that a \"now or never\" effort should be made. In round figures, Mr. Coombs said, the Committee might think in terms of a total international credit package of $2 billion over and above the present swap line of $500 million and the short-term European and Canadian Bank credit of $500 million, both of which would be presumably repaid out of the British drawing on the IMF. In building up such a $2 billion package, Mr. Coombs thought, the U.S. share would probably have to be about $500 million. He was hopeful that the Treasury or the Export-Import Bank might be able to provide $250 million, one-half of the U.S. share. The remaining $250 million from the U.S. side should, he believed, be provided by an increase in the Federal Reserve swap line with the Bank of England from $500 million to $750 million. 11/24/64 Chairman Martin asked Mr. Hayes if he had any comments, and Mr. Hayes replied that he would add only that he was fully in accord with Mr. Coombs\\' recommendation. Mr. Hickman asked what the prospects were for obtaining the $1.5 billion credits from non-U.S. sources called for by the proposal. Mr. Coombs replied that since noon, European time, when the market situation had reversed, he had discussed the problem with officials of the Bank of Canada, who were now consulting with their Government. He thought there was a fair and perhaps a good chance that the Canadians would put up $150 million. He also had alerted the German Federal Bank to the situation, but so far he had not been able to contact any other central banks. Mr. Hayes reported that in a conversation with officials of the Bank of England this morning he had suggested that the U.S. might be able to help assemble the package of credits. They had asked, however, that no steps in this direction be taken until they had hac an opportunity to decide whether they wanted the credits. Chairman Martin said that, in his judgment, the issue before the Committee now was whether the Federal Reserve was prepared to increase the reciprocal currency agreement with the United Kingdom by $250 million if a package of credits such as that 11/24/64 -7 outlined by Mr. Coombs was put together. The British might decide not to request such credits, but thac matter, he thought, was outside the purview of the Committee at present. He would hope that the System would adopt a posture of being as helpful as it could. Mr. Wayne asked whether his understanding was correct that the proposed Committee action today would be conditional on the development of a package of credits such as had been described and also on a decision by the Bank of England that they needed such credits. Chairman Martin replied in the affirmative. He thought it would be helpful to authorize an increase in the swap line today on those two conditions, so that the System would be in a better position to act, if necessary, over the next several days which included the Thanksgiving Day holiday in the U.S. and a weekend. Mr. Wayne commented that he felt the Committee should act with promptness and forcefulness. Mr. Hackman said his only question was whether the proposed authorization might not be too limited. Perhaps the Committee should authorize an increase of as much as $500 million in the swap line with the United Kingdom in light of the possibility that the amounts to be sought from other sources might not all be forth coming. 11/24/64 -8- Mr. Mills said he was somewhat concerned that the approach being taken might reflect some elements of panic on the System\\'s part. There had been no discussion of conditions that the Federal Reserve System might place on a further extension of credit to the British. He was not clear as to what assurances the Committee might have that assistance rendered at this time would plug the gap and save the situation rather than simply constitute a further contribution and a further liability assumed by the Federal Reserve. Mr. Hayes could have been in error ir offering the System\\'s services in the effort to make up this package. The continental European countries might well view such actions as reflecting more than enlightened self-interest on the System\\'s part; perhaps they would take them to :.ndicate that the situation posed a problem to the U.S. and that there was concern about the stability of the dollar. It seemed to Mr. Mills that it would be better for the British to make their own arrangements. Mr. Hayes responded that it was primarily the task of the Treasury, rather than of the System, to see that the British made the best possible arrangements and to assure that their program was successful. He also emphasized that the System was not taking any risks under procedures followed for the swap arrangements. As to how the package was arranged, he agreed that the other countries should help. However, it was conceivable to him that the attitude 11/24/64 -9 of continental European countries toward the proposed package of credits would be strengthened if they felt that the United States supported it fully. This country clearly had a self-interest in avoiding a crisis that could involve the dollar. Mr. Mills said that he was not challenging the suggestion that the United States should be helpful ir the present situation. But he did have doubts about the approach on psychological grounds. There was no certainty that the proposed package would solve the problem, and he was sure that the continental Europeans would not approach the problem without concern over the means by which it ultimately would be resolved. Mr. Daane said it seemed to him that Mr. Hayes\\' position was correct. In his own thinking he began with the view that Mr. Coombs had expressed: that the proposed package of credits was by far the better of the two alternatives Mr. Coombs had outlined, and it was the last resort open at present. Secondly, with respect to the U.S. share, he agreed that the Committee should demonstrate its willingness to participate, in the interest of furthering international financial cooperation. But he thought it would be better for the larger share of the total package to come from sources other than the United States, particularly since the drain on sterling had come from countries other than the U.S. He did not believe it would be wise for the arrangements to have the appear ance of reflecting primarily Anglo-American cooperation. 11/24/64 -10 Mr. Hayes agreed. With respect to Mr. Hickman\\'s comment, he felt that the Committee should consider increasing the swap line by $250 illion at present with the realization that the Special Manager might want to recommend that the Committee authorize a larger increase if necessary to make up a deficit in the total package. Chairman Martin said that he thought Mr. Mills had touched on a macter of legitimate concern, but one that was a problem primarily for the United Kingdom and the U.S. Treasury. In his opinion $250 million was a reasonable amount by which to increase the swap line at present. He added that the negotiations for the total package would have to take place promptly, and he inquired whether the Committee was prepared to authorize the recommended increase. Thereupon, an increase in the swap arrangement with the Bank of England to $750 million, as recommended by Mr. Coombs, was approved unanimously, subject to the agreement of the Bank of England and to the satisfactory development of a package of credits of the type described by Mr. Coombs. In taking this action, it was understood that the aggregate amount of foreign currencies held under reciprocal currency arrangements authorized in the continuing authority directive with respect to foreign currency operations was increased by $250 million to $2.350 billion. 11/24/64 -11- Chairman Martin reiterated that the matters discussed at this meeting should be considered highly confidential by all con cerned. He added that Committee members not in Washington would be kept informed of developments. Thereupon the meeting adjourned. Secretary\\'s Note: Acvice of completion of the arrangements for assistance to the United Kingdom was received on November 25. An amended continuing authority directive was transmitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the following anrouncement was released to the press at approximately 2 p.m. EST: The Federal Reserve System and the U.S. Treasury today issued the following statement: Eleven countries and the United Kingdom today made arrangements providing $3 billion to pack up Britain\\'s determination to defend the pound sterling. Today\\'s funds are in addition to the $1 billion drawing the United Kingdom will obtain from the International Monetary Fund at the end of this month under an existing standby. Austria, Belgium, Canada, France Germany, Italy, Japan. The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States, joined by the Bank for International Settlements, moved quickly to mobilize a massive counter attack on speculative selling of the pound. The International Monetary Fund drawing, which can have a maturity up to 3 years, will enable the British to pay off all outstanding short term credits from central banks, including the Federal Reserve. The currency swap arrangement with the Federal Reserve System has been raised by $250 million to $750 million, and a $250 million credit has been made available by the U.S. Export-Import Bank. (These amounts are included in the total package of $3 billion.) n Assistant ']"

Good afternoon, everybody.  Thank you for coming, and I am sorry about the awkward time.  I am also sorry I wasn't able to talk to many of you in advance of the meeting.  I just got back from Basel yesterday, and so I have been out of the country.  Let me tell you why I called this meeting.  I have become increasingly concerned that our policy rate is too high to fully address the downside risks to growth.  We have cut 100 basis points since September, and I think that may possibly have roughly offset the credit factors and the housing factors, but I don't think that we can claim that we have done anything in the way of taking out insurance against what I think are some potentially significant downside risks.  Meanwhile, since our last meeting in December, the data have been on the whole negative.  The fourth quarter looks all right, but since then we have seen a number of indicators that the economy is sliding.  So I thought it would be worthwhile for us to have an intermeeting meeting, so to speak, just to get an update on the situation and to have some discussion of our policy strategy. As you know, we circulated a draft policy statement for the contingency that the Committee might want to act on rates today.  After getting some feedback, and with some thought, unless the sentiment of the Committee to move today is especially strong, I am not going to propose a policy action at this meeting.  What I would really like to do, instead, is get a sense of where the Committee is and a sense of your willingness to be somewhat more proactive in terms of addressing the downside risks that we are seeing in the growth situation.  Part of the reason it is scheduled today is that tomorrow I have a sort of well-publicized speech on the outlook and next week I have a testimony.  I would like to be able to give some signal of where  the Committee is going forward toward the end of January.  I think that would be very beneficial.  The markets in part are suffering from just simple uncertainty about whether the Fed is willing to be proactive in addressing the downside risks, and I think if I am able to give some signal about our inclinations that would be quite helpful.  So, in short, the purpose of the meeting today is not to take any action, but rather it is my attempt to consult with you, so that when I speak in public tomorrow and next week I will be representing the broad consensus of the Committee. With that, I would like to begin with some short briefings by Bill Dudley in New York on markets and by Dave Stockton in Washington on the forecast-I think you received materials today-and then give time for Q&A.  Following that, I would like, because I called the meeting, to give you my own views on why we need to be somewhat more proactive in risk management.  Following that, we will open the floor, take comments, and sort of see where we are at the end of the day.  I hope that works for everybody.  Okay.  If there are no comments, let me call on Bill Dudley to discuss the market situation. MR. DUDLEY.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll be referring to the chart package that I hope you have in front of you.  Market function has improved somewhat since the December FOMC meeting.  This can be seen most notably in the term funding, foreign-exchange swap, and asset-backed commercial paper markets.  In addition, some of the risks of contagion-for example, from troubled SIVs and from financial guarantors to money market mutual funds or the municipal securities market-appear to have lessened slightly.  However, while market function has improved and contagion risks have diminished somewhat, the underlying strains on financial markets remain severe and may even have intensified.  This can be seen in a number of areas, including (1) the wide spread of jumbo mortgage rates relative to conforming mortgages, (2) the equity prices and credit default swap spreads of a broad  range of financial institutions, (3) developments in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, and (4) corporate credit spreads and credit default swap spreads.  Put simply, market participants believe that the macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated significantly and financial asset price movements broadly reflect that shift in expectations.    Turning first to the better news, term funding pressures have moderated considerably over the past few weeks.  As can be seen on the first page of the handout                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  in exhibits 1, 2, and 3, term funding spreads have fallen sharply for dollar, euro and sterling rates.  For example, the one-month LIBORŒOIS spread is now 31 basis points, down from a peak of more than 100 basis points in December.  However, the narrowing in three-month term spreads has been much more modest, and neither spread is back to where it was in late October or early November.  Much of the recent improvement is undoubtedly due to the passage of year-end.  But coordinated central bank term funding actions, including the term auction facility (TAF) and the dollar term funding auctions conducted by the ECB and the SNB, appear also to have been helpful.  The first two TAF auctions went well, with bid-to-cover ratios of around 3 to 1 and stop-out rates below the 4.75 percent primary credit rate.  Interestingly, term funding spreads narrowed notably on the two days when these auctions settled.  This supports the notion that the TAF auctions did contribute to a lessening of term funding pressures.  Moreover, market participants have generally reacted favorably to the news that the TAF auctions would continue and that the size of the January auctions would increase to $30 billion per auction.  As hoped and anticipated, stigma appears to have been less of a factor for the TAF compared with the primary credit facility.  The stop-out rate rose slightly in the second auction relative to the first, and some less healthy institutions bid more aggressively in the second auction.  This suggests that, as depository institutions gain experience with the TAF, that might lead to an even further diminution of stigma.    As term funding markets have improved, the foreign exchange swap market has also improved in terms of function.  Bid-asked spreads have narrowed, and transaction sizes have increased.  The all-in cost of funding via foreign exchange swaps has fallen back down to approximate the cost of straight dollar LIBOR financing.  Improvement in market tone is also visible in the interest rate swap market.  As can be seen in exhibit 4, swap spreads have fallen notably from the peaks reached in the fourth quarter.  Another positive development has been the improvement in the asset-backed commercial paper market.  The volume of ABCP outstanding has stabilized, and the spread between the thirty-day ABCP rate and the one-month OIS rate has narrowed sharply.  The spread relative to one-month LIBOR is about back to what it was before the financial market turbulence began in August (exhibit 5).  Bank sponsors have generally stepped forward to take problem SIV assets back on their balance sheets, and this has reduced the risk of asset fire sales.  Also, the roll-up of SIV assets onto bank balance sheets has reduced the risk of further contagion to the money market mutual fund industry.  Finally on the positive side of the ledger, although the financial guarantors remain under significant stress (as shown in exhibits 6 and 7, there has been no recovery in the share prices or CDS spreads for the two major financial guarantors-MBIA and Ambac), this has had only a modest effect on the municipal securities market.  Apparently, investors have decided that the quality of the underlying municipal securities is quite good-the historical default experience after all has been very low-and therefore have not been that troubled by the decline in the quality of the insurance on these instruments.  That said, any actual downgrade of the financial guarantors' credit ratings could still disturb the municipal market, in part, through its potential impact on insured  municipal bond funds, which use the AAA ratings obtained from the insurance as a selling point to retail investors.  Despite these positive developments in terms of market function, financial conditions have tightened as balance sheet pressures on commercial and investment banks remain intense and as the macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated.  This can be seen in a number of respects.  First, large writedowns and larger loan-loss provisions are cutting into bank and thrift capital and pushing down equity prices.  For commercial and investment banks, the willingness of sovereign wealth funds and other investors to replenish capital has kept bank CDS spreads from widening back to the peaks reached a few months earlier.  In contrast, major thrift institutions face greater difficulties in attracting new capital because their core business has soured.  As a result, their CDS spreads have soared.  The spread between fixed-rate jumbo mortgages and fixed-rate conforming mortgages has climbed again (see exhibit 8).  This reflects the impairment of the mortgage securitization market and the lack of spare balance sheet capacity for commercial banks and thrift institutions.    Second, corporate credit spreads and credit default indexes have widened sharply in the past few months, with a significant rise registered since year-end.  As shown in exhibit 9, for investment-grade debt, the widening in spreads has roughly offset the fall in Treasury yields.  As a result, investment-grade corporate bond yields have been relatively steady.  In contrast, for non-investment-grade corporate debt, the widening in credit spreads has dwarfed the decline in Treasury yields.  As a result, non-investment-grade corporate debt yields have climbed sharply.  Although actual corporate default rates have remained unusually low, forecasts of prospective default rates have become much more pessimistic.  For example, Moody's announced yesterday that it had raised its speculative corporate debt default estimate for 2008 to 5.3 percent from 4.7 percent earlier.  Exhibit 10 illustrates that, since mid-October, credit default swap spreads have been rising in both the United States and Europe.   Third, equity markets are under pressure.  For example, as illustrated in exhibit 11, the S&P 500 index declined in the fourth quarter and, up through yesterday, has fallen about 5 percent so far this year.  Moreover, the equity market weakness has broadened out beyond the financial sector.  For example, as of yesterday's close, the Nasdaq index, which has little weight in financials, had fallen 8 percent this year.  Global stock market indexes have also generally weakened.    Interestingly, the dollar has been relatively unaffected by the deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook.  After rallying into year-end, the dollar has given back much of these gains over the past week.  But over the past few months, the dollar has mainly been range-bound as opposed to being in the downward channel that applied for much of 2007 (exhibit 12 illustrates what the dollar has done lately against the yen and the euro).    As the economic outlook has deteriorated, market participants' expectations of monetary policy easing have increased markedly.  As shown in exhibit 13, the federal  funds rate futures market now anticipates about 100 basis points of additional easing by midyear.  As shown in exhibit 14, the Eurodollar futures market anticipates a bit more than 125 basis points of further easing by year-end 2008.  Currently, as shown in exhibit 15, options prices on federal funds futures imply a probability of about 50 percent of a 50 basis point move through the January 29-30 FOMC meeting.  Interestingly, market expectations for an intermeeting move appear to be relatively low.  Although it is difficult to be precise about this, my best guesstimate is that the market has priced in about a 1-in-4 chance of a 25 basis point intermeeting rate cut.  Although that means that a rate cut today would be a big surprise to market participants, it probably would be well understood in hindsight.  The sharp downward skew in rate cut expectations that has been evident in recent months persists.  As shown in exhibit 16, which looks at the expected distribution of Eurodollar futures rates 300 days ahead, the mode is 3.25 percent, well above the mean of the distribution.  This likely reflects market participants' collective judgment that there are two distinct scenarios.  The first (and more likely) scenario is one of an economic slowdown and a modest rise in the unemployment rate.  This scenario is associated with perhaps 100 basis points of additional easing.  The second scenario is a much darker one of a full-fledged recession.  In this scenario, the unemployment rate would move up more sharply, and the magnitude of cumulative rate reductions would be much larger.    Finally, despite the rise in headline consumer price inflation, the uptick in core consumer price inflation, and the atmospherics created by firmer gold and oil prices, market-based measures of inflation expectations remain very well behaved.  As shown in exhibit 17, both the Barclays market-based measure of five-year, five-year-forward breakeven inflation and the Board's measure have narrowed since early November.  Thank you.  Of course, I'm happy to take any questions now or after David's presentation.      CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Bill.  Why don't we take a few questions for Bill.  Does anyone have questions for Bill?  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Bill, on the five-year, five-year-forward, doesn't the Markets Group also have its own measurement, and is it as low as the Board measurement?   MS. MOSSER.  This is Trish Mosser talking.  Yes, we do have our own measure.  It is somewhat less noisy than the Barclays measure; but because it is based on market prices, it is closer to the Barclays measure than to the Board's measure, which of course is based on the staff's yield-curve model.    MR. DUDLEY.  I think the important thing is that all three of these measures are moving in the same direction.  So I wouldn't want to put a lot of weight on the level of these three measures, which differ because they adjust differently for liquidity and on-the-run/off-the-run comparisons, but they have all moved down pretty meaningfully since November. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Bill? MR. FISHER.  I agree that we shouldn't place a whole lot of weight on this thing.  We have been talking about this, Mr. Chairman, on the morning call.  There may be some anomalies here, but I wouldn't place a whole lot of weight on that.  I just wanted to get a sense of how the Board's measurement was different.  It looks to me to be more range-bound, just to use your term, Bill, but that's not a point worth spending much time on.  Thank you. MR. DUDLEY.  Well, as I have said in past briefings, I think the Board's measure has a better analytical foundation.  If I had to pick one measure, I would probably pick the Board's measure because I think it is trying to do a more precise estimation of comparing apples with apples in terms of comparing TIPS with nominal Treasury securities.  This comparison is difficult because you have to make assumptions about what the liquidity premium is on nominal Treasuries that are on-the-run versus off-the-run and versus TIPS.  So I think that it is probably useful also to see if movements in the Board's measure are or are not corroborated by movements in other measures. MR. FISHER.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Bill?  All right.  If there are no other questions for Bill, let's turn to Dave Stockton for an update on the forecast. MR. STOCKTON.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Earlier today along with Bill Dudley's materials we circulated a note describing some of the revisions that we have made in our projection since the December forecast.  I should caution the Committee                                                  2 The materials used by Mr. Stockton are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).  that this projection has not been the result of running the complete machinery that sits behind the staff's forecast.  Rather, we've done our usual, I hope, careful job of doing the near-term adding up, and then we've used the model simulations and rules of thumb to adjust our medium-term outlook to reflect changes in the data and changes in the conditioning assumptions that we've taken on board here.  That said, I do feel reasonably comfortable that what we're showing you here puts us in the right ballpark in terms of how the data and how changes in some of the major conditioning assumptions are likely to affect the forecast that we will be showing you in a few weeks.   Several key features of note in this revised forecast:  Growth in real GDP in the fourth quarter of last year has been revised up by a noticeable amount.  However, we will revise down growth in real GDP in both 2008 and 2009 also by a noticeable amount.  Unemployment runs higher throughout the projection period.  Despite that higher level of the unemployment rate, total and core inflation are higher in 2008 than in our December forecast because of sharply higher oil prices incorporated in this forecast.  Inflation is roughly unchanged in our 2009 projection.  So let me touch briefly on each of these elements.  As you can see in the table, we've revised up our estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter from a forecast that was basically flat at the time of the December meeting to an increase of about 1¼ percent at an annual rate.  Much of that revision reflects the stronger retail sales data that we received shortly after the last FOMC meeting as well as the stronger consumption of services that we received in the personal income release late last month.  In addition, the incoming data on construction put in place for November were much stronger than we anticipated for nonresidential structures and for state and local construction.    Not all the data that we've received, however, have been on the positive side.  Housing continues to outflank us on the low side.  Both starts and permits for November came in well below our forecast, and sales of new homes were much weaker than we'd expected.  We now think the trough in housing starts, which we still see as likely to occur in the first half of this year, will be deeper than our previous forecast and by a considerable amount-nearly 10 percent deeper is what we've built into this revised provisional forecast.  The other major negative surprise was the employment report for December.  Private payrolls contracted by 13,000 last month.  We'd been expecting an increase of about 50,000.  Moreover, the unemployment rate jumped 0.3 percentage point in December.  That increase was certainly eye-catching from our perspective.  As we noted in the handout, higher average hourly earnings offset the weaker employment so that the labor income actually is not too much different than we had expected at the time of the December forecast.  Still the labor market appears to us to have softened noticeably last month, and we've taken signal from that and revised down expected employment growth going forward.  Our forecast for economic growth in the first quarter is unrevised at an annual rate of ¾ percentage point.  We do carry a little more momentum in consumer spending  and a little more momentum in nonresidential structures into the first quarter, but that is offset by the substantial downward revision that we're making to the housing forecast.  Beyond the near term, we've had a lot of negative influences to contend with.  I've already noted that we've taken down our housing forecast.  That revision alone was sufficient to knock another tenth off GDP growth in 2008, bringing the total subtraction of housing from GDP growth in this projection in 2008 to ¾ percentage point.  Oil prices are about $6 per barrel higher on average than was incorporated in our December forecast.  The impact of those higher oil prices on purchasing power and consumption are large enough to reduce projected GDP growth in both 2008 and 2009 by a tenth each year.  I should note that households are on the verge of experiencing another stiff increase in gasoline prices over the next couple of months, and households are probably not yet aware that that's on the way, except for those that actually follow oil futures markets-I assume that's a relatively small group.    We've lowered the path for equity prices by 7 percent in this forecast.  About half of that revision reflects the change that occurred since we put the December Greenbook to bed.  The forecast that I circulated today doesn't include yesterday's decline or today's increase.  We basically used Monday's close.  The other half of the decline in equity prices that we've built into this baseline forecast currently reflects the fact that, for purposes of this provisional forecast, we made no change in our assumption about the path of the federal funds rate from our December Greenbook.  Obviously, the December path assumed no change in the funds rate at the January meeting.  That would come as a significant disappointment to the markets, and by our normal calibration, we estimate it would take about 3½ percent off the level of equity prices going forward.  So that gets us to the 7 percent.  House prices have come in a touch lower than we had forecast.  We have also lowered our projection on the level of house prices about 1 percentage point in this forecast.  Taken together, those lower equity prices and the lower house prices take 0.1 off growth in 2008 and 0.2 off GDP growth in 2009.    Turning to the labor market, the jump in the unemployment rate in December in combination with our weaker outlook for growth in real GDP going forward has led us to raise our projected level of the unemployment rate to 5.2 percent at the end of 2008 and 5.3 percent at the end of 2009.    As for prices, the recent news on inflation has been disappointing.  Total and core PCE prices came in above our expectations in November.  As can be seen in our table, we've raised our estimate of total PCE price inflation in the fourth quarter to 4 percent, and we've increased our estimate of core PCE price inflation to 2.7 percent.  Both those figures are ½ percentage point above our estimates in December.  Some of the upward revision in the core price measure is due to higher figures for nonmarket prices, but market-based prices were higher than we had expected as well.  Going forward, the higher oil prices that I referenced earlier also leave a clear imprint on projected inflation.  We've raised our headline price inflation to 2.4 percent in 2008, up 0.4 percentage point from our previous projection.  With  energy prices expected to edge off in 2009, total PCE inflation recedes to 1.7 percent.  For core inflation, we've added 0.1 percentage point to our projection this year, reflecting the indirect effects of higher energy prices.  Our forecast for core inflation in 2009 is unchanged.  Some lingering indirect effects from higher energy costs are offset in this forecast by a wider margin of slack in resource utilization.    Let me just say a few words about how the risks to the forecast have changed.  I believe that the adjustments that we have made to this provisional forecast actually are quite reasonable in light of the developments and the data that we have been contending with, but I'd have to admit that the downside risks to our projection have become more palpable to me.  Despite a year of nearly continual downward revision, we just can't seem to get in front of the contraction in housing.  The steep descent in sales and construction of new homes has not let up, and there seems to me to be more downside risk than upside risk to our house-price projection.  Another area of concern would be the recent readings on the labor market, which have been very soft.  Although quite volatile on a week-to-week basis, initial claims for unemployment insurance and insured unemployment have been trending up.  Moreover, both the payroll survey and the household survey deteriorated noticeably in December.  As I noted earlier, private payrolls contracted last month, and a jump of 0.3 percentage point in the unemployment rate in a single month is rare, though not unprecedented, outside of recessions.  The steep decline in the manufacturing ISM in December was both unexpected and of a magnitude well outside the normal volatility in the data.  The drop in consumer confidence has pretty much matched our expectations, and it didn't continue to worsen in December; but the total drop that we have seen in recent months is similar to drops seen before previous recessions.  Any one of these indicators taken by itself would not be especially troubling; but taken together, they certainly deserve attention.  We are not ready to make a recession call yet.  The spending data still have exceeded our expectations by a noticeable margin, especially consumer spending.  Motor vehicle sales at a 16.2 million unit rate in December certainly don't look like a recessionary development, and business spending has slowed but certainly not slumped thus far.  Furthermore, the anecdotes-at least my read of the anecdotes-still seem more consistent with the weak economic growth that we are projecting rather than outright contraction.  But at this point we do feel as though we are on very high alert.  I'd be happy to take any questions from members of the Committee.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Dave.  Are there questions for Dave?  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  Yes, Dave.  So there is a lot written about nonlinearity and macroeconomic dynamics.  There are these regime-switching econometric models characterizing real data.  There is the 0.3 thing-I think it is 0.3- that people talk about regarding the  unemployment rate:  It doesn't go up by more than 0.3 without going up by a ton.  You guys are surely aware of those econometric properties or those methods of characterizing the data, and while your econometric models may be strictly linear in some sense, what you give us is your best judgment, right?  Am I to take your forecast as reflecting the probabilities of nonlinear dynamics or not?  If it doesn't, are nonlinear dynamics something you believe in, that you think we should internally adjust your forecast with, or not? MR. STOCKTON.  I believe in nonlinear dynamics.  [Laughter]  I think I have even experienced them, and probably you have as well on occasion, in terms of the difficulty that we have in forecasting recessions.  Our forecast isn't just some sort of ﬁpush a button on a linear model and here is the result.ﬂ  But I do think the current situation illustrates to me why it is, in fact, so hard for us and why we don't forecast recessions very often.  As I indicated, I think there is a configuration of a number of indicators that make it easy for me to imagine you looking back on next June and saying, ﬁIndeed, what you saw back there in December-in terms of the jump in the unemployment rate, the drop in the manufacturing ISM, and the uptick in initial claims-were all precursors of a recession.ﬂ  The point of my remarks is that I am pretty darn worried about that possibility.  But it is hard at this point to make that call-we are coming off the data in the fourth quarter, which have exceeded our expectations considerably.   As I noted, not all the things that you might expect to be highly sensitive to a business cycle downturn, such as motor vehicle sales, have moved in that direction.  I know this is unfortunate, and we really cannot be as helpful to you as I would like.  We are saying, in effect, ﬁYes, we'll call the recession when we see the weak spending data.ﬂ  But the weak spending data will already be lagged one or two months, and that is the reason that we will be looking back, if we're lucky to be able to do it in March, saying, ﬁThe spending data indicate that a recession  may have started in December.ﬂ  The current forecast is our best judgment.  But I think it wouldn't take much more in the way of negative news for us at this point to regime-shift, as you said, into recession mode.  We are not quite there yet, but we are certainly worried about that possibility at this point. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Dave?  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Dave, you very eloquently summarized in your statement that downside risks are more palpable.  Certainly they seem to be more palpable.  But the bigger adjustments I see in your numbers, at least for the first quarter of 2008 and for the year 2008-even larger than the adjustments you made on economic growth-are those on inflation.  I'm wondering if you could just comment on that, please, and give us a sense of that palpability, as it were.  MR. STOCKTON.  So, indeed, I think this combination of weaker economic growth and higher inflation is an unfortunate situation for you as policymakers.  I do think there are some upside risks that you face on inflation, and the recent rise in oil prices probably intensifies those upside risks.  We are taking some comfort from two other pieces of information in the constellation of the inflation data that the process isn't slipping away to the upside on inflation.  One is, as Bill noted, that we haven't really seen any deterioration in the TIPS-based measures of inflation expectations.  We have seen an uptick in the Reuters/Michigan survey of households in the last month or so, on both near-term and long-term inflation expectations.  That does tend to happen in periods when gasoline prices are spiking up.  I would hate to throw that observation out completely, but I guess as we look at this, we don't really see as yet convincing evidence that there has been a deterioration in inflation expectations.  The other thing is that we haven't really seen anything in the way of serious deterioration on the labor cost side.  So those two things combine, at least in my mind, not to eliminate but probably to limit some of the upside risks that  you're facing on the inflation side.  But, clearly, anecdotes are there-not just the data but also anecdotes-that suggest that businesses are facing some considerable cost pressures associated with higher energy and other commodity prices. MR. FISHER.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there other questions for Dave?  If not, if I could kick off the general discussion, I will talk a bit about how I see the economy.  I have two main points to make.  First, I think the downside risks to the economy are quite significant and larger than they were.  Speaking as a former member of the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee, I think there are a lot of indications that we may soon be in a recession.  I think a garden variety recession is an acceptable risk, but I am also concerned that such a downturn might morph into something more serious, and I will talk about that in a moment.  My second point is that I think that 100 basis points of easing may or may not be a rough offset, in terms of expectations, to the decline in demand that we have seen, but I don't think that we have done really very much at all in terms of taking out insurance against what I perceive to be the greater risk at this point. So let me address those questions just a bit.  President Lacker already anticipated me in mentioning the regime-switching models of recession.  Those suggest a nonlinear process:  There are two states of the world-a growth state and a recession state-and the behavior of the economy is different in those two states.  Those models fit pretty well, although, of course, like many econometric models they are mostly retrospective.  But some of the indicators suggesting a switch are things like falling equity prices, slower manufacturing growth, rising credit spreads, and-an often very effective indicator-the fact that the federal funds rate is so far above two-year interest rates at this point.  Those would all be indications that the regime is about to switch, if it hasn't already.  President Lacker also mentioned the idea of a stall speed.  I presented some figures on that in a meeting in 2006.  There have been situations of a 0.3 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate in a month that have been reversed, but there has never been in our case a 0.6 increase over a period of time that didn't translate into a recession and a much greater increase in unemployment.  Similarly, there has never been a sustained GDP growth rate below 2 percent-and we have a 1 percent forecast for 2008-that has not turned into a recession.  Indicative of the kind of behavior that we have seen in the past, let me just refer to the last two recessions.  Unemployment was 5.2 percent in June 1990, having been there for about two years.  It jumped to 5.5 percent in July, by the next June it was 6.9, and the following June it was 7.8.  In December 2000, unemployment was 3.9, it was 4.3 at the cyclical peak in March 2001, and ultimately it hit 6.3 in June 2003.  So there is some tendency, once a stall speed is reached, for the economy to slow quite considerably.  Again, like David, I don't know if we're there yet.  Obviously, ex ante it's extremely hard to tell, but I do think the risks are at least 50 percent at this point that we will see an NBER recession this year.  Now, as I said, the concern I have is not just a slowdown but the possibility that it might become a much nastier episode.  The main mechanism I have in mind-there are several possibilities, but I think the financial markets are the main risk.   Let me talk a bit about banks, which are at the center of this set of issues.  I'm going to talk a bit about the 21 large, complex banking organizations (LCBOs).  I have had some data worked up for me by the supervisory staff.  Since August these 21 LCBOs have announced $75 billion in extraordinary markdowns associated with various credit issues.  They have, on the other hand, either raised or plan to raise $50 billion in capital.  Therefore, one might say, ﬁWell, that looks pretty good.ﬂ  I think, though, on net that there is really actually quite a fragility here.   Several factors are going to put pressure on bank capital going forward.  First, they have been taking assets on the balance sheet, as you know-about $250 billion so far of semi-voluntary additions coming from off-balance-sheet conduits and others.  It is hard to say how much contingent additional exposure they have.  There are a lot of different estimates.  For these 21 banks, the Board supervisory staff identified between $250 billion and $300 billion more of potential exposures to bring back on the balance sheet.  The BIS, at the meeting I attended over the weekend, looking at the 20 largest international banks, estimated $600 billion.  We don't know how much it is going to be, but the banks themselves are somewhat unsure about potential exposures. Loan-loss reserves are quite low for this stage in the cycle, about 1.4 percent, compared with, say, 2.5 percent during the headwinds period of the early 1990s, and that is partly a result of the SEC regulations, which have forced banks to keep their reserves low.  There is a lot of concern in banks about additional credit losses and downgrades, concern about financial guarantors, and, of course, macro concerns.  Finally-and I think this is one of the most worrisome things to me-we are beginning to see some credit issues outside of housing and mortgages.  Credit card delinquencies have jumped in a few banks' home equity lines.  There are concerns in commercial real estate, particularly in some regions like Florida and California.  And with fair value accounting, as pricing goes down, even if you don't yet see a cashflow effect, you get immediate effects on capitalization. The implications of this, even if the economy continues along, say, the Greenbook's estimates, are that lending is going to be quite tight.  Banks are reluctant to take loans onto their balance sheets because of the capital constraints.  They are, in fact, raising their internal capital targets because of their concerns about credit losses and about additional off-balance-sheet  responsibilities.  We have seen contraction not only in the primary mortgage market but also in home equity lines of credit, and I suspect we will see tighter conditions for credit cards, CRE lending, and non-investment-grade corporates.  A question is high-grade corporates.  There has even been some deterioration in, say, A-rated corporations. I have had a lot of opportunities to talk to bankers.  We had a meeting over the weekend in Basel between the central bankers and about 50 private-sector representatives.  The thrust that I got was that things are going to be pretty tight.  ﬁWe are going to meet our regular customers' needs, but all of this is conditioned on no recession.ﬂ  As one banker put it in our meeting, ﬁThere is no Plan B.ﬂ  So a concern that is evident is that, if economic conditions worsen notably, the effects on bank capital, on credit risk, and so on will create a more severe credit situation, which could turn a garden variety downturn into something more persistent. The other issue, of course, is housing.  Credit markets and housing are interacting very closely.  I think that residential construction is going to stop subtracting so much from GDP growth because there is a non-negativity constraint.  Eventually, the declines in residential construction will have to stop, but we are pretty far from the non-negativity constraint on prices, and I think that is where the issue is.  I have reviewed the staff's analysis of house prices.  They make perfectly reasonable guesses about what house prices will do.  But it is inherently very difficult, and there is a very wide range of possible outcomes.  If the housing market continues to be weak and if credit continues to be tight, then the possibility of a much more significant decline in house prices, particularly in some regions, is certainly there; and that, in turn, would have significant effects on credit markets and on the economy. So I have tried to be quick; I don't want to take too much time; but I see a lot of indications that a recession may well happen.  Given the additional considerations of credit  markets and housing markets, I am concerned that we might get something worse than, say, 2001.   The other question I raised was, Have we done enough?  We have done 100 basis points.  Of course, it is hard to know.  A few indicators:  The Greenbook-consistent medium-term r*, which is an indicator of the real funds rate that leads to full employment in three years, was 3.3 percent in August 2007.  It is currently about 1.8 percent, so that is a decline of 150 basis points.  That is just one rough indicator of the decline in aggregate demand.  I have not redone the Taylor rules, but for December the estimated forecast- and outcome-based Taylor rules showed a rate of about 4.0 to 4.1.  Again, that would not include any risk-management considerations.  That is just sort of an average over periods of both inflation risk and growth risk.  I guess I would also mention the 2001 pattern, the most recent episode.  The FOMC-many of you were there, I was not-dropped the rate 250 basis points in a little over four months in early 2001.  Obviously, that was a much more aggressive episode. What about inflation?  The fact is that we are in a tough bind here, and we don't have any easy, simple solution.  We are going to have to balance risks against each other.  We are going to have to do it in a forward-looking way, and we are going to have to try to make some judgments.  I'll make a couple of comments.  First, even assuming no recession, as the staff does, the staff has core and total inflation back into a reasonable approximation of price stability by 2009.  As they note, wage growth has slowed; that doesn't seem to be incorporating any inflation pressures.  The other thing I would say is that, if we do have a recession, inflation during recession periods does tend to fall fairly quickly.  In the 1990 episode I mentioned before, between June 1990 and June 1993, core PCE inflation fell from 4.4 to 2.7 percent.  Of course, in the 2001 episode, despite 550 basis points of easing, we went from 2.2 percent in the fall of 2001 to unwelcome  disinflation in 2003.  So should there be a recession, the inflation problem would probably take care of itself. Now, there is an argument-and Governor Mishkin's speech on Friday makes the case pretty well-that, when you have these kinds of risks, the best way to balance the growth and inflation risks is to be aggressive in the short run but to take back the accommodation in a timely way when the economy begins to stabilize.  I realize this is not easy to communicate, but I think if we attempt to do so we can make some progress on that front. So, to summarize, we have a very difficult situation, but I do think the downside risks have increased and are quite significant.  I don't think that our policy thus far has gotten ahead of the curve, so to speak, in terms of taking out insurance.  Although, again, I'm not recommending any action today, I think we need to be cognizant of this issue as we go into the January and subsequent meetings.  So let me stop there and open the floor for your reactions and comments.  I'd like to know if you are comfortable not acting today-waiting until the January meeting.  On the other hand, I am also interested in knowing if you share my assessments or if you don't.  Let me be clear:  I am not asking now for a commitment to any particular action in January.  I am not asking for carte blanche.  I am simply trying to see if we are all on the same page, or more or less on the same page, so that we can collectively communicate more effectively and I hope take the right actions when the time comes.  So let me stop there, and Debbie will call on members.  President Lacker.   MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On the threshold question about acting today, I don't think we should act today.  Intermeeting moves are relatively rare, they tend to be headline-grabbing, and in retrospect they turn out to mark-and are usually intended to signal-dramatic breaks from previous practice or reaction functions.  From that point of view, I think in  the current context a move at this call would inevitably be interpreted as a reaction to the increase in the unemployment rate, just given the timing of when the data have come out and when the move is.  I don't think that would be a good idea. I share the sense that recession is a definite risk now and that the risk has gone up.  I think that is persuasive.  We have gotten real growth numbers that are weaker now.  I think the outlook has to be weaker now than it was several weeks ago.  But I am worried about inflation, too, and I wonder what a more proactive approach means for our strategy for inflation.  The staff forecast that David presented marked down the real GDP forecast for '08 by 0.3 and marked up the overall inflation forecast by 0.4.  The usual Taylor rule puts a bigger weight on the inflation part than on the GDP part, and it doesn't suggest a knee-jerk aggressive move down.  I'm not saying that's not what is required now, but it suggests some questions.  Would a more proactive approach bring our expectations about our reaction closer to the market's view?  Is that how you interpret what you are advocating here?  Or is this to move us beyond what the market expects? Related to this, are you asking for some shift in our strategy on inflation?  I mean, are you asking that we be willing to tolerate an increase in inflation or an increase in inflation expectations?  In the current circumstances, and what looks likely for the next several months, it is hard to picture reversing course really rapidly.  If things play out the way the staff forecasts, it is just hard to imagine us turning around and raising rates 50 or 100 basis points if inflation rises 1 or 2 percentage points.  It is heartening that inflation expectations numbers haven't risen more than they have, and I take comfort from that.  But they are around 2½ percent on the CPI.  It is not clear that what they reflect isn't that occasionally we get it down to 2 but most of the time it bounces around above that.  Without our having a clear sense of what our strategy is about where we want to bring inflation, I just question what you are advocating means for inflation strategy.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me just respond quickly.  Obviously, I am not advocating any change in our objectives.  I just think that at this point we have not quite balanced the risks to our objectives appropriately, and you could think of it as a level adjustment, if you'd like, and not a change in path.  I would just note the risk of having what could be a strictly inefficient outcome, in which the growth situation gets so far out ahead of us that inflation falls too much, as happened in 2003.  I believe that we can make essentially a level adjustment and try to get a little ahead of the risks here.  So long as the market expects the economy to slow-and I note that they are already expecting quite a bit of easing and inflation expectations aren't moving-I think we can do that in a safe and reasonable way.  I am not in any way advocating changing our objectives.  I am suggesting that we are not quite calibrated properly to achieve our objectives.  President Rosengren. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My views are actually very consistent with your own.  I would support lowering the fed funds rate 50 basis points, and, if it were up to me, I would support doing it right now.  The employment report last Friday was weaker than I expected.  In conjunction with the likelihood of several quarters of economic growth below potential, the risk that the economy is in, or could be going into, a recession is too high.  Continued declines in housing prices and stock prices raise my concern that deteriorating household wealth will constrain consumption more than we anticipate.  I am also worried that weaker labor markets are likely to exacerbate problems in the housing market.  Should housing prices fall further and foreclosures rise more rapidly as a result of weak labor markets, financial markets may experience even more turmoil than we have experienced to date.  Commodity and oil prices have risen, but I expect that the weakening in labor markets will be sufficient to  restrain inflation.  The downside risks to the economy are significant, and I think we should take aggressive action to mitigate that risk.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with both the concerns that you expressed and the analysis that you offered.  Based on the data we now have in hand, I support a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate in the near future.  I think a very good case can be made for moving down 25 basis points today, and it would be my preference.  According to what Bill Dudley said, markets apparently do attach some probability to a move of that magnitude before the January meeting.  I could also support a 50 basis point move today, but I am concerned that it might be taken as a sign of panic by the Committee and somehow wrongly indicate that we have inside information showing that things are even worse than markets already think or, alternatively, be seen as an overreaction to the employment report.  But if we don't move today, I do think we need to take decisive action in January, and I hope you will give a strong signal that we will do so in your speech.  I agree with the staff's assessment that the outlook for economic growth has weakened since December, and I also see the downside risks to the forecast as having increased since then.  We have revised down our 2008 forecast also because of the sharp increase in energy prices and the deterioration we have seen in financial conditions just since December.  It is good that conditions in money markets have improved somewhat, but equity prices have fallen very substantially-I guess around 6 percent since our last meeting.  Credit spreads are up, and borrowing rates for many borrowers are higher in spite of a decline in Treasury yields.  I also find the labor market developments worrisome.  I try not to put too much weight on any single monthly observation, but I find it entirely believable and consistent with everything else we are  seeing that we have entered, at best, a period of slow employment growth.  It is something that we have been expecting all along.  It helps to resolve some of the puzzles we have been discussing about why labor markets have been so strong relative to goods markets. It is true that consumer spending has been amazingly robust so far, but I find it unimaginable that it can continue when slow growth in disposable income is added to everything else that is weighing on households, particularly rising energy prices, accelerating declines in house prices, and falling stock prices.  It seems to me that, with the stagnant or contracting labor market, the odds of a recession-and, as you argued, a potentially very nasty one-have risen.  I am also very worried about the possibility of a credit crunch if higher job losses begins to make lenders pull back credit.  It is true that on the inflation front the recent news hasn't been particularly good.  It certainly is true that there are upside risks.  But I do take comfort from the fact that inflation compensation has remained well behaved and that we already have slack in the labor market and more seems likely to develop. I support a significant rate cut not only because of the downgrade to the economic forecast since December but also because I think the stance of policy even now with the actions we have taken-I agree with you-is still within the neutral range.  Given current prospects and the asymmetric nature of the risks, particularly the high tail risk associated with the credit crunch, I believe that policy should be clearly accommodative.  So having revised down my forecast, I would support a significant funds rate cut as a way to catch up with where policy should be. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I largely share your assessment, so let me just make a few comments about the situation as I see it and about the timing of our action here.  I  have talked frequently, of course, about the resilience of the economy.  But I need to remind myself that that resilience isn't infinite, and it appears to me that the fundamental positive momentum of the economy is diminishing significantly at this point.  This likely will affect not just the next quarter or two but the intermediate-term outlook as well.  Moreover, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that at least some of the economy's much-vaunted resilience is arguably the effect of appropriate policy responses in the past.  At least we can't dismiss that possibility, and so we need to bear that in mind as we consider our actions going forward. I think you made an effective case that resilience in this situation could be further inhibited by potentially serious problems in the banking system.  I have been concerned for a long time, as you know, that we don't have incentives right there.  While certainly this isn't proof of anything, I guess we can't dismiss the possibility that some of the chickens are coming home to roost, and that could affect the outlook as well.  Also, attitudes, at least in some quarters, seem quite sour today.  In particular, the closer people are to Wall Street, the more negative the attitudes appear to be.  So all of this suggests to me that the outlook at the moment is not very promising, and a significant policy response on our part is appropriate. As far as the timing of action is concerned, I do think on balance it is preferable to wait until the end of the month.  Other things being equal, I'd like us to be seen as proceeding in an orderly way.  Also, if we do that, I think it will provide the opportunity for a more thorough discussion of the economic and inflation outlook and a more comprehensive consideration of the state of the economy, the potential policy path going forward, and the production of a coherent statement at the end of the day.  So for all those reasons, on balance, I would prefer waiting until the end of the month.  One footnote, since you mentioned it-this is a discussion for another day-as you know, I viewed at the time and I continue to view the 2003 disinflation experience a bit differently than you do, and I think we may want to be careful about the lessons we draw from that experience.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If one of the lessons is that we need to take the accommodation back, I agree with you on that one.  President Fisher. MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like you, I am increasingly concerned about the downside on the economic growth side of the equation.  I would very much appreciate-perhaps all of us would appreciate-getting sort of a transcript of the numbers you gave us and perhaps some of the BIS data between now and the time we meet because it might be most helpful in our analyzing the situation.  I just have a couple of comments.   First, I agree with President Stern and President Lacker-this is not the time to make a decision that is of this import.  I think it would frighten the markets, and it would perhaps add to the urgency of concern that you are concerned about.  In other words, it would compound our problems rather than solve our problems.  I am not sure where I stand as far as the upcoming meeting is concerned.  I would like to get some more data.  I think we will have a little more inflation data by that time.  We will have a better sense other than just the employment numbers and, again, if we are able to study what you learned at the BIS, will be better informed.  I don't like the idea of making a decision of this nature outside normal channels.  In fact, I think the impression that you, sir, have given directly to the markets is that you don't feel comfortable either making a fed funds decision outside the normal channels.   I am always concerned when we talk about what market expectations are because in this recent cycle, and the mood that the market is in, as one of my friends put it, we give the market a  gift of a rate cut and then they burst into tears and run outside the room after they have unwrapped the package.  I think we have to be very careful here about thinking that we are going to satisfy markets somehow.  I don't think the market is in that kind of mood, and my experience as a market operator indicates that, almost in any context, we are not going to get it just right with markets.  I think we have to do what is right for the economy. The other point I would make is in terms of the 1990-93 experience and the 2001 experience.  This is something that we need to think through a bit further, at least here in Dallas.  There is a difference in the sense that a lot of the inflationary pressures we are feeling are demand-pull inflationary forces that are coming from newly emergent economies that are at a point in their growth cycle where they are kicking in to caloric and BTU intake at a much faster rate than the rate that they are growing.  If we were a closed economy, of course, the issue of labor prices and so on would bear an enormous amount of weight, and the concerns that have been expressed would be most consequential.  They are still consequential, but I am not convinced at this point in the evolution of the global economy that we are likely to see as much mitigation as the staff is forecasting.  It is just a question mark, but I think we should be aware of it.  So, in summary, I don't think we should decide at this meeting.  I think it would be the wrong signal to send.  It goes outside the norm, including the norm that I believe you yourself have expressed.   On the questions you asked about signaling, we just received a memo from the representative from Nashville-that is, Governor Kohn-about being very careful what we signal in our speeches.  I think that is a very delicate thing to do, Mr. Chairman, in terms of building expectations that may or may not be fulfilled or may be misinterpreted.  So I have the same concerns that President Lacker expressed on being proactive.  One last comment.  No matter what you say, and in terms of representing our views and your views, it is very, very important to remind everyone that we have a dual mandate.  The mandate is, of course, about employment growth, but we also have a mandate on the inflationary front.  I still have concerns that we might be planting some seeds that could later germinate more rapidly than we would like to see them germinate if indeed we don't have the kind of weakness that we are all afraid of currently.  So I think it is constantly helpful, especially coming from you as our leader, to make sure that we reinforce the dual mandate without scaring the markets that we are not aware of the potential tail risk of severe economic weakness.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I will certainly do that.  President Evans. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would not have thought to call an intermeeting videoconference.  I tend to think of the in-person meetings as those where we make the decisions and do the analysis.  But since you made us think about it, I agree with your assessment of the economy.  I think that things are noticeably softer.  I don't think there is much accommodation in place at a funds rate of 4¼ percent.  To influence aggregate demand noticeably we probably need accommodation on the order of what you are talking about, which is about 100 basis points from a neutral federal funds rate.  That range is probably on the order of 4½ to 4¾, so that would put such accommodation at 3½ percent.  We have to recognize that monetary policy, if it is going to have any influence on aggregate demand, is going to do so with a lag.  That is what all our analysis assumes and suggests, and so if we want to influence aggregate demand to limit midyear weakness, I think we need to take action sooner rather than later.  In terms of the data developments that you talked about, one thing that is taking place right now is that uncertainty is being resolved.  The weakness that we are seeing I am currently interpreting tentatively as sort of an unraveling of things that we haven't seen so far, not necessarily a deeper weakness.  The December data have been weaker.  The employment data were poor, and the unemployment rate was a lot higher.  In constructing my outlook for the economy in 2008 and beyond, I had been more optimistic than many that consumer spending would hold up in part because of the positive labor market situation.  Taken at face value, the December employment report puts a crack in that supporting foundation.  It is now likely, it seems to me, that consumer spending will soften with these labor developments. Dave Stockton went through a bit of analysis of the indicators that might lead to a recession.  President Lacker and you, Mr. Chairman, mentioned regime-switching as well.  I just want to mention that in Chicago we have been publishing our Chicago Fed National Activity Index for a number of years.  We started out right at the onset of the 2001 recession, as it turns out.  As you know, Mr. Chairman, this index is very closely related to your data-rich environment analysis with Jean Boivin and Stock and Watson.  If you do an analysis where you try to assess these regime-switching events, this indicator has done a fairly good job of picking that out when it goes below a threshold of, say, minus 0.7.  That is some of the probabilistic analysis that I did with this back then.  If you take some of the developments in the employment report at face value, I think that this is headed for a probability of recession this year that is higher than 50 percent.  So we have to be a little concerned about that.  Anyway, that is the economic situation that I worry about a good bit. What about inflation?  Clearly there are risks, and the risks are evident.  Core inflation rates are projected to be higher in the near term.  Headline inflation has been significantly above  core for long enough to make people wonder about underlying inflation, but inflation expectations have remained contained.  With energy prices traversing high levels over a short time, the possibility of pass-through during a period of economic weakness cannot be dismissed.  We also have to be concerned about the reputational cost of inflation going up.  But, again, I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that if we do end up with significantly weaker economic activity, it would limit the inflation risk. What is hard in this period is balancing the risks of going slowly on monetary policy if we really think that the risk of a recession is higher.  I agree with what you said and Governor Mishkin's thinking about being aggressive in the near term to respond to weakening aggregate demand and then making sure that we take back any excessive accommodation at the appropriate time.  I know that's hard, but I think that's what we should do.  I would actually favor action today on the order of 50 basis points because I think that's about the only way to get to 3½ in a quick enough period of time by our next meeting.  That's what I would prefer.  Anyway, those are my comments. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser. MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with a lot of what I've heard around the table.  I am certainly open to the idea that we will have to reduce rates at our next meeting at the end of the month.  I am not necessarily opposed to that.  Even if I were certain of that, though, I do agree with what a lot of people have said already-I don't think an intermeeting cut is either wise or appropriate at this point.  As a general proposition, I oppose the idea of intermeeting cuts unless a really immediate action is necessary to deal with some severe crisis such as September 11 or something of the like.  I am not going to reiterate all the concerns that others have shared about the risk of an intermeeting cut; I don't really want to belabor that.  I do  think, though, that I would just add one point.  Even if we were aggressive now, it is not going to get us off the hook later.  I am afraid that, if we took an aggressive cut today, an intermeeting cut, the markets would respond by just wanting even more going further out.  I'm not sure that we want to put ourselves into that bind.  Nor do I want us to be perceived as responding to near-term numbers or other pressures from the market.  So I am definitely open to further cuts at the end of the month.  I share your concern about the economy.  It certainly has taken on a sour note in recent data.  But I also would note that we are going to get a lot more data between now and the end of the month that will help us sort through perhaps the severity or the dimensions of the slowdown.  I would certainly like to have those in hand before I make a final decision. We are in a bind.  I share the view, or at least I'm sympathetic to the view, that aggressive cuts in the context of declining demand are supportive.  But I also share the view of President Lacker that, although we may want to take accommodation back quickly, the history of this institution is that it doesn't do that very well.  Given the forecast that the staff has provided us, I think that is going to be very difficult.  I worry that, if such a scenario comes to pass and we need to take it back, we will not act promptly enough.  Certainly, we all can say that now, as we are making the cuts and supplying the accommodation; but I worry that, when the time comes to remove it, we will be reluctant to do so.  Having said that, I am sympathetic about the concerns.  My outlook is certainly weaker than it was a few weeks ago, but I would not like to see us do something today.  I will leave it at that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart. MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Many of my thoughts have already been stated by others, so I think I can be relatively brief.  I appreciate the approach that you are taking.  I am inclined to be more proactive and would even support an intermeeting move if I felt that the  market were better prepared.  I supported-actually, I argued for-a 50 basis point cut on December 11, and the prevailing view at that time was that 50 basis points plus the TAF would spook the market.  As I recall, in your summary you said something to the effect that, if it were 0 or 50, you would probably go with 50 but, since we had the option of 25 plus the TAF, you supported that approach.  I saw greater risks to the downside in December, and I still do.  But like President Stern-I think President Plosser said essentially the same thing-I'd prefer that we preserve the appearance of being a bit more orderly.  So I have some misgivings if we go forward with a 50 basis point cut today, and my concerns really relate principally to tactics. In my conversations with people over the holidays, I sensed a great deal of angst.  I think I mentioned this to you in New Orleans the other day.  They worry that there is no one in charge, and therefore I think the appearance of this move today would conceivably put our credibility at risk.  You can argue that point perhaps either way.  If we were to move today and it worked well, then it would preserve and enhance credibility.  But let me just say that I am concerned that the sequence of actions from December through a possible move today would appear to be panicky and a bit incoherent.  I think in many respects that is what President Stern said. So to summarize, I am very likely to support a 50 basis point rate move later in January or even intermeeting in a week or so after more preparation of the market.  I think it's important that we husband our credibility at this time, and obviously I agree that we have to watch inflation and indications of changing expectations very carefully.  I am not unconcerned with that, but I see the risks as greater to the downside.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto. MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, am troubled by the weakness in the real economy data that we are seeing.  Our Beige Book contacts confirm the weakness, and my  business contacts to whom I have been talking report more weakness than they did before our December meeting.  However, they are not flashing signals about a recession.  Next week we will learn more about just how weak the fourth quarter was through the retail sales and industrial production releases for December.  Next week we are also going to get the December CPI report.  In my view, the October and November reports were very disappointing.  In November, 60 percent of the CPI market basket prices increased at rates of 3 percent or greater. On learning of today's meeting, I was concerned about making a large policy move ahead of the December CPI report for fear that we would be damaging some of our credibility on price stability, so I did not want to make a move at today's meeting.  However, I can support a 50 basis point reduction at our meeting at the end of the month if we are regarding that reduction-and regarding our cumulative policy actions-as just offsetting the decline in the equilibrium real rate and we are not being aggressively accommodative.  That would be, in my view, appropriate policy given my concerns about inflation.  But the public could interpret our actions as being aggressively accommodative and that we are downplaying inflation risks.  So I hope, Mr. Chairman, that you will be able to communicate your thinking on this, as you have with us today, in some of your upcoming public statements.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I recognize that the risks on the economy are elevated.  I have recognized it for some time.  My concern is that the risks are elevated as dangerously, if you will, for inflation as for the slowdown.  We have at this point a situation in which we have revised up our inflation numbers and yet that is after we have cut 100 basis points, which we have not seen the full effect of.  Those rate cuts are in process now, and they are not going to address the housing issue, given its circumstances, and they are going to work  slowly through the rest of the economy as we move forward.  We have revised up in our estimates the fourth-quarter real GDP numbers, and I think that is important to note even though I know our risks overall are elevated for growth, given some of the data coming in.  Job growth came in disappointingly.  It did so also in September, and it was revised up significantly after that.  I don't know if the numbers will be revised up, but I would like to go cautiously, recognizing that they have been revised up in the past.  I think there are tail risks.  There is an important risk of the economy slowing, perhaps going into recession.  I think that there is an elevated risk of the inflation numbers continuing to creep up as they have over the past several months.  If these inflation numbers continue to rise as we decrease interest rates, there is a very serious cost that will have a very significant detrimental effect on the economy in the long run, which we need to keep sight of. My concern-as others have expressed, but it is a very serious concern on my part-is that we say we can reverse the policy position or raise interest rates later.  But it is extremely difficult, and understandably so, because the earlier actions will still be having an effect while the economy shows a slowing.  When it starts to pick up, we won't be sure, just as now, whether we really are going to accelerate and whether the economy is going to pick up.  So we delay in reversing those actions, understandably so.  So that is why I want to be very cautious about coming down with our interest rates because we will be very cautious going up with our interest rates on the other side of that. I am very pleased that you have not put an actual proposal on an action today.  I would be very uncomfortable with that.  I think we need to have a full discussion with more information before we commit to any kind of interest rate moves at our month-end meeting.  I understand the  risk, but I think it requires a lot of analysis as we look both at inflation and what that may mean to us if it's rising and at the real danger of a recession.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I put a very high weight on policy regularity, and I believe that improved regularity has had a lot to do with policy success in the last quarter-century.  But it is worth discussing this for just a minute because of some of the issues you will have to face in the context of signaling.  If we were to cut rates today in an intermeeting action, immediately the market would be wondering what happens on January 30.  Are they going to just stand pat on no change, then, on January 30, or will there be more?  Those issues would be very difficult to resolve by any of us.  We would not want to make a flat statement that we would rule out further action on January 30.  On the other hand, it would be very uncomfortable in explaining what that would be.  So we would increase volatility in the markets and increase questions about our policy strategy and policy direction.  So I think it is wise not to act today.  I think we should reserve those actions for days or conditions when immediate action is required that can't wait three weeks until the next regular meeting. Now, in terms of the signaling issue-and I share all the concerns that have been expressed both about inflation and about the state of the real economy-next week we get important information on the real economy.  We get retail sales and industrial production.  We also get housing starts and permits and the PPI and the CPI.  One reason for maintaining a policy strategy that focuses on reserving the decision to the time of the regularly scheduled meeting is that we can say that at that time we will incorporate all the information at hand and not try to make a judgment in advance of that information when we don't really have to reach that judgment.  If today were the regularly scheduled meeting, I could support 50 basis points for the  reasons that people have been saying.  But it's not a regularly scheduled meeting, so you're going to have the same problem in terms of signaling that we would have if we were to make an intermeeting decision.  Now, you could avoid this issue by talking about baseball, I guess, or some other subject; but, in fact, that would be totally inappropriate, so you're going to have to say something.  You can't be totally noncommittal.  If you look at the options market, there is apparently a 0.6 probability of a 50 basis point cut on January 30, when we make that announcement.  I would certainly not favor trying to nudge that dramatically one way or the other.  It seems to me the most important thing to communicate is the overall strategy that we follow.  If you were to quite deliberately nudge that a lot higher, trying to push that probability to 1.0, then you could be-we don't know, but you could be and we could be-in a very uncomfortable position if we got outsized increases much higher than anticipated in the inflation numbers that come next week.  Indeed, you could have upside surprises in the real economy numbers as well.  Then, having almost committed ourselves to the 50 basis points on January 30, we would be in the very uncomfortable position of how we take that away.  So it seems to me that the signaling strategy should be to concentrate on the way in which we reach decisions by incorporating the best information that we can gather and the most thorough analysis that we can apply to the problem and by making the decision at the time that we have the regularly scheduled meeting. If the data on the real economy continue the trend that we have already seen and if the inflation numbers are more or less as expected, the market is going to bid up that probability of a 50 basis point cut.  If we then reach exactly the same conclusion, we will have a very good synchronization of our policy and market expectations.  It seems to me that what we don't want  to do is produce a signal that then produces a risk of an immediate conflict between that signal and the incoming data.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I certainly share your concern that the current federal funds rate is too high.  You said that you thought we had about offset the effects of tighter credit and declining house prices on demand.  I'm not so sure that we have actually done enough to make that offset.  Certainly, if you look at the staff forecast, we haven't.  They have the unemployment rate rising to 5¼ percent, half a point over the NAIRU, at the current funds rate, which suggests to me that the current funds rate is substantially above neutral, not at neutral.  If you look at the market-and, President Fisher, I assure you I am not going to get pushed around by the market-I do think the market is telling you that there are a lot of people out there who think that the funds rate has to drop 100-plus basis points more, and they don't think that will be consistent with a pick up in inflation.  Now, they could be wrong.  I'm sure they probably are and often are.  But I think there is some signal there about the degree of pessimism out there about underlying demand that we shouldn't throw away entirely just because it is coming from the market. So in my view, policy is probably still restrictive rather than neutral.  I don't think we fully adjusted to the deteriorating condition we saw in December.  What we saw then was that the credit constriction had spread and would be bigger and more prolonged than we had thought previously.  We saw a steeper, more intense housing decline, with multiplierŒaccelerator effects, and wealth effects on the decline in house prices.  We saw the beginning of spillovers to other sectors, and I don't think our 25 basis points really adjusted to all that new information.  Moreover, the incoming information, although it hasn't lowered the near-term GDP, does imply  weaker growth going forward.  With regard to the labor market, it is true that it is one month, but it is three different sources of data-the household survey, the establishment survey, and the initial claims-all telling us the same thing.  Now, we will get more information over the next couple of weeks on at least the initial claims part of that and the continuing claims.  I think we should treat the labor market information as more than just one series for one month.  It's three series for one month, and there is probably a little more weight there.  In addition, the new orders and the ISM survey, housing, and stock market wealth have declined substantially since the meeting.  So I would say, obviously, we have no insurance.  I'm not even sure we're at neutral, and I see the downside risks that you, Mr. Chairman, Dave Stockton, and many others have talked about, particularly from the credit markets and credit conditions. I agree that the inflation situation is somewhat concerning.  Now, some people have cited the increase in the staff's inflation forecast for 2008 of 0.4 percentage point; but of course that's the energy price situation.  I think so far through this cycle the feed-through of energy prices into core inflation has been pretty darn low.  The staff has built in a little here.  Inflation expectations do remain anchored.  To be sure, the core inflation numbers came in a little higher, so they're a little worrisome, too.  I think there is going to be less pressure on resources than we thought.  The unemployment rate is higher, capacity utilization will be lower, and I think the competitive pressures are going to constrain compensation and prices.  As somebody pointed out, the fact that even at a 4½ percent unemployment rate we really have seen very little, if any, pickup in labor costs suggests that my concern about that occurring at a 5 and a 5¼ percent unemployment rate would be very, very low.  If the staff is right-and, of course I just heard the Romers lecture me about how the staff was right and the Committee wasn't-[laughter] then a 50 basis point  decline would just about put interest rates at neutral.  It wouldn't be accommodative, and therefore, I don't think would be particularly inflationary. I agree with everyone else.  If I thought that a decline in rates would increase the most likely forecast for inflation-put it on an upward track-that would be unacceptable.  Or if I thought a decrease in rates would increase inflation expectations, which would then give legs to an increase in inflation, that would not be acceptable either.  But I think a decrease in rates at this time under these circumstances doesn't really have that risk.  It does shift the balance of risks a bit.  If you take a little of the downside risk out of growth, you are presumably taking some of the downside risk out of inflation, maybe shifting that risk on inflation at the same time.  But I think a substantial decrease in interest rates at this time would not shift those risks on inflation so that they would deviate from the general path over the next couple of years that most of us saw in our projections in October.  So I'm not as concerned as President Lacker about that. In sum, I agree that we need to reduce rates substantially just to get close to buying insurance.  I would do it sooner rather than later.  I would have been prepared to support an intermeeting move today.  I think the data are weak enough; we are far enough behind the curve.  To me, looking at the equity market declines, what we have seen since the middle of December is a bit of a loss in confidence in the financial markets that we will do enough soon enough to keep the economy on an even keel.  So I think there has been a palpable deterioration in confidence in the Federal Reserve out in the financial markets.  I am concerned that we are going to get three weeks of bad news and that the erosion of confidence will just gather steam.  But I see the issues and the negatives also.  An orderly FOMC process is to be protected.  We are at risk of scaring the markets or looking as though we are lurching.  I think we are at risk, if we move, of creating market dynamics such that they would constantly be in volatility and on alert  as to when the next intermeeting move is.  So there are a bunch of negatives here; and I guess on balance the case for moving-especially if it's not supported generally by the Committee because I think it has to be supported generally by the Committee-is not overwhelming.   Obviously, I am prepared to wait and make a substantial move at the meeting, but I agree that you should signal something in your speech tomorrow that we are likely to move against the emerging economic weakness.  I don't think, President Fisher, that a speech that the Chairman makes after consulting with the whole FOMC is comparable to the speeches we make as individuals.  He doesn't have the risk of misleading the market when he has heard from all of us at the same time.  This is a very different situation from the situation that many of us were in during the previous intermeeting period.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Warsh. MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just a few notes.  First, on financial markets and financial market functioning, I think as Bill Dudley suggested that they are much improved from our last meeting.  I take that as a very, very good sign, and I think that the improvement in financial market functioning will be useful to us to help calibrate the effects of changes in monetary policy.  We spent some time even today talking about where we are on some range between neutral and accommodative and where we want to go.  When the markets aren't working, then any policy that we could conceive of would in effect be restrictive, if the markets weren't willing to take our action and do something with it to provide credit.  So I think we were right to focus on getting the markets back to work, which is a process that isn't complete, but I think the trends are our friend there.  Second, concerning financial intermediaries, I would underscore the point that the Chairman made at the outset.  The problems among large financial institutions are very serious, and unlike financial market functioning, which has improved, I  think the state of these institutions has not improved since we met last.  While it is true that they have been raising capital, both in the form of equity and convertibles, the process of writedowns and capital-raising is far, far from being complete.  I think we continue to have some headline risk, both in the United States and among non-U.S. institutions, between now and our meeting at the end of the month as well as throughout the first quarter. The good news is that the real economy data have superseded those data with respect to financial institutions.  The bad news is that these top twenty or so institutions are still largely ill-equipped to facilitate credit or to be shock absorbers here to any great degree.  If you think about that in terms of other shock absorbers that might be available, including fiscal policy, I think there is reason for the seventeen of us on this conference call to feel relatively lonely in thinking about policies that can be brought to bear, both from the private sector and the public sector.  With respect to the real economy, even if one isn't as pessimistic in terms of probabilities of a mild recession or as pessimistic on the chance of a really, really ugly scenario much more dire than that, I still think that risk management suggests going in the direction that the Chairman emphasized for reasons that have already been discussed by many others on this call.   As I mentioned, I think there is more burden on monetary policy as I think about fiscal policy and some of these other measures.  That gives me a view that perhaps we should be erring on the side of reaching for a little more by way of rate cuts than we would in a parallel universe where we had financial institutions and fiscal policy that were likely to be quite useful.  I'm somewhat less certain that either of them will be able to stand here in the fray.  With respect to tactics, I think the right course of action is, as Governor Kohn just referenced, for the Chairman to provide some direction to the markets in his speech.  That direction will not be perfect.  They will not understand exactly our posture, but I think they do need to hear from him a sense of  where we are collectively, and tomorrow provides a really good opportunity to do that.  It would be good for them not to be surprised to any great degree when we meet in a few weeks, and I think the Chairman will rightly focus them on the real economic data.  So as the data change, their own expectations of policy could change as well.  Governor Kohn talked about the possible erosion in confidence in our ability to put policy in place, and I think that by meeting today and hearing one another's views, having the Chairman go tomorrow, and then meeting to finalize our judgments on policy action, given all our constraints, is the best course of conduct.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner. MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much.  I, too, as everyone around the table has said, think that there is significant heightening of the downside risks over the last few weeks.  As I mentioned at the last FOMC meeting, in talking with a contact at a large credit card company, I saw a very sharp deterioration in consumer behavior.  I subsequently spoke with another credit card company that focuses more on the higher-end consumers and found exactly the same issues there of slowing payments-even taking into account the seasonals-more delinquencies, et cetera.  So it wasn't just a middle market phenomenon; it was also happening on the higher end.  The quick change between October and DecemberŒJanuary, unfortunately, seems to be consistent-or is potentially consistent-with the regime-shift model that we have been talking about.  Also, the sharp rise in the unemployment rate could be consistent with that.  I just returned from Europe, where concern is growing and there are some especially sharp changes.  Spain is seeing some very sharp changes in their housing sector as well as in consumption, and consumption is going down in the United Kingdom.  From discussions there, I also had the feeling that they are going to be relatively slow to react to the challenges.  So I think we will be  getting less support than we have been getting from exports.  Also, given that a lot of rate resets are coming, we know that there are going to be more delinquencies and foreclosures.  That is kind of baked into the cake.  So we know that there are going to be more challenges in the financial system, regardless of everything else, over the next nine months.  It does make a lot of sense to think about taking out some insurance against those kinds of risks.   I very much agree with the Chairman's characterization of the challenges that we will have in the banking and financial system because I think it is not a traditional credit crunch, when there is a sharp contraction, because so much has been brought onto financial institutions' balance sheets.  Not only has a lot been brought on but also there is a really dramatically reduced ability to get things off the balance sheets.  Basically, over the last five years or so, the reason that financial institutions could provide so much intermediation and so much support is that things didn't stay on the balance sheets.  Now, because there is an impaired ability to get things off the balance sheets, it requires much more capital to support the same amount of funding that had occurred in the past.  Just to try to keep funding at the same old levels is going to require dramatically more capital.  They will get more capital, but they are not going to get dramatically more, so that will mean that it will be more and more difficult for them to support funding of operations going forward.  So it is very important to think about taking out insurance now. With respect to inflation, as a number of people have mentioned, there are some disturbing readings recently.  But something that is heartening, and for me is really the most important thing, is that I don't see much evidence so far of a significant change in expectations, because that is really where the long-term costs of our policy moves come in.  If there is a temporary slight movement up in inflation, if inflation expectations don't become unanchored, then the cost is relatively low, particularly given the very large downside cost of a regime-shift to  a recessionary scenario.  Although I am certainly supportive of a fairly bold move at this point, I do think it would be better to wait a few weeks.  I think we achieve some of that by clarifying where we stand through our public discussions.  But as a number of people have said, I really think we have done a very good job, despite a lot of pressure with respect to our reaction functions, in how we react to data, forecasts, and such.  I think we would lose some of that if we were to move today.  That doesn't mean that we should never move, but I do think it would be a bit of a loss because people could misinterpret what we've been doing and, exactly as Governor Kohn said, set up a bad dynamic.  After our FOMC meeting at the end of this month, however, we actually have an enormous amount of data that come out because GDP comes out just as we're finishing up our meeting.  Then the details come out after that.  We get another GDP report.  We're going to get two employment reports.  So I certainly, in some sense, want to keep my powder dry with the possibility of an intermeeting move in the future, but I think that's a time when we're going to be getting a lot more data about which we may want to say it's the time to move.  It would be better from our broader communications policy standpoint to say that there have been enough data showing that we really do need to make a move.  Thanks. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Mishkin. MR. MISHKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with the Chairman's general assessment of the risks to growth, and I think that currently we are well behind the curve and that we need to act much more aggressively in terms of monetary policy.  However, I want to say that, even though I take the view that we need to be much more aggressive, I do not think that today is the day to do it.  There are really three reasons that I am not in favor of doing a move today.  The first is that it is very important to keep moving in the direction that I have hoped we are moving in, which is to be much more systematic in terms of thinking about monetary policy  and actually communicating that to the markets and the public.  Moving today would have the potential to indicate that we are being much more discretionary than I think would be appropriate, and that could be very problematic.  I also would be concerned that it might give an impression that we would be overreacting to one piece of information-the employment report-and I think that would also be dangerous.  There is serious potential for this to be viewed by the markets as our panicking, and that would, again, be very harmful in the current environment. In terms of where I think we should be heading with monetary policy, I definitely think that given the information we have today, though things clearly may change in the next couple of weeks, we would need to move at least 50 basis points at the next meeting.  Actually, I don't want to rule out the possibility of doing even more at the next meeting or talking about having a contingent move, for which we'd prepare the markets, so that it would be more systematic in terms of a possible intermeeting move afterwards because there is important information-another employment report, retail sales, and so forth-that will come out shortly after the next FOMC meeting. As I talked about at the last meeting-and I will go into this in more detail in a speech on Friday-I think it is very important to be ahead of the curve and react aggressively to financial market disruptions.  There is an issue of very strong nonlinearity that makes the normal response, which we think about in terms of doing optimal policy-the standard linear quadratic framework we often work in-not the correct one.  In a situation such as the one we are dealing with now, with a lot of potential for nonlinearity, it is extremely important to get ahead of the curve.  This argues for quite aggressive action at this point-as I said, not particularly today but in the near future.  One concern that people have raised is the potential upside risks to inflation.  I am less worried about that than some other members of the FOMC for the following reasons.  Very importantly, inflation expectations seem very solidly grounded.  We have had no indication of any deterioration in terms of inflation expectations, despite our previous easing moves and the very high increases in energy prices.  Second, when I think about what drives inflation and what are the dynamics of the inflation process, what is important are expectations not only with respect to inflation but also with respect to the future path of output gaps.  In particular, I do not see at this juncture that people are worried that we are going to allow the economy to get overheated.  In fact, it is the opposite right now.  We are more worried about the downside risks, where there will be increased economic slack in the economy, and of course, that is consistent with the forecast coming from the Board staff.  So when I think about the inflation process, I think in terms of underlying inflation, which is inflation not over the next year but over the longer run, which is appropriate for monetary policy and when we can have an effect.  I do not see that the upside risk is huge there; in fact, this is very important in terms of allowing us to be aggressive in this situation of financial disruption. One issue that I think is very important, which other participants here have raised, is that there is a fear that we might overshoot if we ease aggressively.  In fact, two things could indicate that we may have gone too far.  One is that we frequently see financial disruptions dissipate very quickly.  That is what I hope happens, so it is not something that I would be depressed about.  I would be very pleased about it because, if things start going the right way, just as you can get an adverse or a negative feedback loop when these financial disruptions occur, you can actually get a virtuous feedback loop, and that can happen fairly quickly.  If that occurs, we should be very ready to take away some of the insurance that we have provided by aggressive easing.  The  second is, of course, inflation expectations.  If aggressive easing led to the unhinging of inflation expectations, that would be a terrible thing.  The most important thing that I think we do is to ground inflation expectations; it is a key part of our success and of central banks throughout the world in recent years.  So I think we have to monitor very carefully what is happening to inflation expectations.  If our easing looks as though it's causing a problem in terms of inflation expectations, then we have to act accordingly. I would argue that the way we have to think about policy is that we need to think about it being less inertial but maybe more systematic.  When we talk about risk management, I think in the past there was some element of thinking that risk management was just discretion.  We have to think about risk management in terms of being more systematic and to think about how we might react to changes in conditions so that we would not be inertial.  By so doing and indicating to the market that we were thinking that way, we could alleviate some of these fears. So the bottom line is that I think that we have to be ahead of the curve.  I am actually very sympathetic to President Evans's view that we are going to have to move more than 50 basis points, certainly, over a longer period than just the next meeting.  I also think that we have to think about that hard and about doing this in a systematic way and prepare the markets to understand why we are reacting the way we are, so that we are not seen as being discretionary but as operating very much consistently with our dual mandate.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.  VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me just say briefly that I completely support the basic framework that you laid out at the beginning, and I think you gave an excellent description of the risks that are ahead for us, the challenges we face, and the basic strategy we have to adopt.  The dominant imperative for monetary policy now is to get rates  down to the point at which we are providing a substantial degree of insurance against the risk of a very adverse growth outcome and a more damaging financial crisis.  This is going to require substantial further policy action, and we are better off getting there sooner.  I think there is more risk to us now in gradualism than in force.  Of course, inflation has accelerated, but I think it is very important that inflation expectations have moved down since December, despite the move in headline and core and despite a very substantial downward move in the expected path of the fed funds rate.  Other than that, I would just reinforce the basic framework you presented.  I would take a fair amount of comfort from the fact that I hear a lot of agreement around the room both on your diagnosis of what is happening and in a general recognition of the extent of deterioration in the outlook and the extent of the increase in terms of the risks to the outlook.  That gives us a better basis for a pretty solid consensus in the Committee on the outlook ahead.  Thanks. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Well, in this less than two hours, we have covered intermeeting moves, policy strategy, assessment of the economy, and inflation dynamics.  I think it has been pretty productive.  Seriously, I very much appreciate it.  I promise to try not to do this too often, but getting this intermeeting update has been very useful for me.  I very much appreciate it.  I think we are a little better prepared for the next meeting when it comes, although obviously, as President Poole pointed out, we will be seeing a lot of data and certainly there is no pre-commitment to any specific action.  But I do think there is at least a reasonable amount of support for the idea that some insurance is worthwhile, and we should keep that in mind as we go forward.  Are there any other comments?  President Hoenig.  MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, just a question.  Will you let the world know we had this meeting?  I ask only because I have a directors' program tonight and a directors' meeting  tomorrow morning, and I don't know what the circumstances are about acknowledging this meeting or anything else.  So I would appreciate some information. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It will be described, I assume, in the minutes, which will be three weeks after the next meeting, so it will be six weeks before this is reported.  It will be reported, I assume, as a consultation and discussion of the economy.  I would advise you not to discuss this with your directors.  If it gets into the market, it could cause confusion and uncertainty.  So if possible, I would not discuss it. MR. HOENIG.  I appreciate knowing that.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker, do you have a point or a comment? MR. LACKER.  Yes.  At the outset, in your discussion you said you were doing this in part to seek our views before you made a speech and testified and wanted our views before you engaged in overt signaling to the market.  Someone else mentioned this, but I wanted to support this as a practice.  I don't expect you to consult us before every public utterance you make but I would just compliment you on this innovation in Federal Open Market Committee practice.  So thank you very much. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Any other comments?  If not, have a good dinner.  Thank you very much, and we will see you in Washington at the end of January, if not sooner.  Thank you. END OF MEETING \""

Willis, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, New York, Boston, and Kansas City, respectively  Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-ket Operations The deputy manager of the System Open Market Ac-count (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in domestic and global financial markets over the inter-meeting period; she also reported on open market oper-ations and related issues.  Financial markets experienced a notable bout of volatility early in the intermeeting pe-riod; volatility was particularly pronounced in equity markets.  Market participants pointed to incoming eco-nomic data released in early February-particularly data on average hourly earnings-as raising concerns about the prospects for higher inflation and higher interest rates.  These concerns reportedly contributed to a steep decline in equity prices and an associated rise in measures of volatility.  Some reports suggested that the increase in volatility was amplified by the unwinding of trading positions based on various types of volatility trading strategies.  Measures of equity market volatility declined over subsequent weeks but remained above lev-els that prevailed earlier in the year, and stock prices fin-ished lower, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Inter-est rates rose modestly over the period.  Respondents to the Open Market Desk\\'s surveys of primary dealers and market participants suggested that revisions in investors\\' views regarding the fiscal outlook were an important fac-tor boosting yields and contributing to a slightly steeper expected trajectory of the federal funds rate.  The deputy manager noted that a rapid and sizable increase in Treas-ury bill issuance over recent weeks had put upward pres-sure on money market yields over the period.  Three-month Treasury bill yields moved up significantly and those increases passed through to rates on other short-term instruments such as three-month Eurodollar de-posits and commercial paper.  The spread of market rates on overnight repurchase agreements over the of-fering rate at the Federal Reserve\\'s overnight reverse re-purchase (ON RRP) facility widened, and take-up at the facility fell to quite low levels as a result.  Rates on over-night federal funds and Eurodollar transactions edged higher relative to the interest rate on excess reserves.  The Desk continued to execute the FOMC\\'s balance sheet normalization plan initiated in October of last year. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk\\'s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the March 20Œ21 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen through February and suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) was rising at a moderate pace in the first quarter.  Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in January.   Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expecta-tions were little changed on balance. Gains in total nonfarm payroll employment were strong over the two months ending in February.  The labor force participation rate held steady in January and then stepped up markedly in February, with the participation      rates for prime-age (defined as ages 25 to 54) women and men moving up on net.  The national unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent.  Similarly, the unemploy-ment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics were roughly flat, on balance, in recent months.  The share of workers employed part time for economic rea-sons edged up but remained close to its pre-recession levels.  The rates of private-sector job openings and quits increased slightly, on net, over the two months ending in January, and the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be low in early March.  Recent readings showed that increases in labor compensation remained modest.  Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector advanced 2¾ percent over the four quarters of last year, and average hourly earnings for all employees rose 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in February. Total industrial production expanded, on net, in January and February, with gains in both manufacturing and mining.  Automakers\\' schedules indicated that assem-blies of light motor vehicles would likely edge down in coming months.  However, broader indicators of manu-facturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to further solid increases in factory output in the near term. Consumer expenditures appeared likely to rise at a mod-est pace in the first quarter following a strong gain in the preceding quarter.  Real PCE edged down in January, and the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its es-timate of PCE rose somewhat in February while the pace of light motor vehicle sales declined slightly.  However, household spending was probably held back somewhat in February because of a delay in many federal tax re-funds, and the subsequent delivery of those refunds would likely contribute to an increase in consumer spending in March.  Moreover, the lower tax withhold-ing resulting from the tax cuts enacted late last year, which was beginning to show through in consumers\\' paychecks, would likely provide some impetus to spend-ing in coming months.  More broadly, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending-in-cluding gains in employment and real disposable per-sonal income, along with households\\' elevated net worth-continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term.  In addition, consumer senti-ment in early March, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, was at its highest level since 2004.  Real residential investment looked to be slowing in the first quarter after rising briskly in the fourth quarter.  Starts of new single-family homes increased in January and February, although building permit issuance moved down somewhat.  Starts of multifamily units jumped in January but fell back in February.  Sales of both new and existing homes declined in January. Growth in real private expenditures for business equip-ment and intellectual property appeared to be moderat-ing in the first quarter after increasing at a solid pace in the preceding quarter.  Nominal shipments of nonde-fense capital goods excluding aircraft edged down in Jan-uary.  However, recent forward-looking indicators of business equipment spending-such as the backlog of unfilled capital goods orders, along with upbeat readings on business sentiment from national and regional sur-veys-pointed to further solid gains in equipment spending in the near term.  Firms\\' nominal spending for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and min-ing sector declined in January.  In contrast, the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation-an indica-tor of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector-continued to move up through mid-March. Total real government purchases seemed to be flattening out, on balance, in the first quarter after rising solidly in the fourth quarter.  Nominal defense spending in Janu-ary and February was consistent with a decline in real federal purchases.  In contrast, real purchases by state and local governments looked to be rising, as the pay-rolls of these governments increased in January and Feb-ruary and nominal state and local construction spending advanced somewhat in January.  The change in net exports was a significant drag on real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, as imports grew rapidly.  The nominal U.S. international trade defi-cit widened in January; exports declined, led by lower ex-ports of capital goods and industrial supplies, while im-ports were about flat.  The slowing of real import growth following the rapid increase in the fourth quarter sug-gested that the drag on real GDP growth from net ex-ports would lessen in the first quarter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1¾ percent over the 12 months ending in January.  Core PCE price inflation, which ex-cludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1½ percent over that same period.  The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending in February, while core CPI inflation was 1¾ percent.  Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run      inflation expectations-including those from the Michi-gan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk\\'s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants-were little changed on balance. Foreign economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter.  Real GDP growth picked up in Mexico but slowed a bit in some advanced foreign econ-omies (AFEs) and in emerging Asia.  Recent indicators pointed to solid economic growth abroad in the first quarter of this year.  Inflation abroad continued to be boosted by the pass-through to consumer prices of past increases in oil prices.  However, excluding food and en-ergy prices, inflation remained subdued in many foreign economies, including the euro area and Japan. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial markets were turbulent over the intermeeting period, and market volatility increased notably.  On net, U.S. equity prices declined, corporate bond spreads wid-ened, and nominal Treasury yields rose. Broad equity price indexes decreased over the intermeet-ing period.  Market participants pointed to a larger-than-expected increase in average hourly earnings in the Jan-uary employment report as a factor triggering increased investor concerns about inflation and the associated pace of interest rate increases.  Those concerns appeared to induce a substantial decline in equity prices.  The de-cline may have been exacerbated by broader concerns about the level of stock market valuations.  On Febru-ary 5, the VIX-an index of option-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&P 500 index-rose to its highest level since 2015, reportedly driven in part by the unwinding of investment strategies designed to profit from low volatility.  Subsequently, equity prices recov-ered about half of their decline, and the VIX partially retraced its earlier increase. Monetary policy communications over the intermeeting period-including the January FOMC statement, the minutes of the January FOMC meeting, and the Chair-man\\'s semiannual testimony to the Congress-were generally viewed by market participants as signaling a somewhat stronger economic outlook and thus rein-forced expectations for further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate.  The probability of the next rate hike occurring at the March FOMC meeting, as implied by quotes on federal funds futures contracts, increased to near certainty.  Conditional on a March rate hike, the market-implied probability of an-other increase in the federal funds rate target range at the June FOMC meeting edged up to just above 70 percent.  Expectations for the federal funds rate at the end of 2019 and 2020, derived from overnight index swap (OIS) quotes, moved up somewhat since late January. On net, the nominal Treasury yield curve shifted up and flattened a bit.  Monetary policy communications, higher-than-expected domestic price data, and expecta-tions for increases in the supply of Treasury securities following the federal budget agreement in early February contributed to the increase in Treasury yields.  Measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury  Inflation-Protected Securities were little changed on net.  Option-implied volatility on longer-term rates rose no-tably following the jump in equity market volatility on February 5 but mostly retraced that increase by the end of the intermeeting period.  On balance, spreads on  investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields widened but remained near the lower end of their historical ranges. In short-term funding markets, increased issuance of Treasury bills lifted Treasury bill yields above  comparable-maturity OIS rates for the first time in al-most a decade.  The rise in bill yields was a factor that pushed up money market rates and widened the spreads of certificates of deposit and term London interbank of-fered rates relative to OIS rates.  The upward pressure on money market rates also showed up in slight increases in the effective federal funds rate and the overnight bank funding rate relative to the interest rate on excess re-serves.  The rise in market rates on overnight repurchase agreements relative to the offering rate on the Federal Reserve\\'s ON RRP facility resulted in low levels of take-up at the facility.  Reductions in the size of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet continued as scheduled without a notable effect on markets.   Despite the recent volatility in some financial markets, financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations and households remained accommodative over the inter-meeting period and continued to support further expan-sion of economic activity.  Gross issuance of invest-ment- and speculative-grade bonds was slightly lower than usual in January and February, while gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans stayed strong.  The pro-vision of bank-intermediated credit to businesses slowed further, likely reflecting weak loan demand rather than tight supply.  Small business owners continued to report accommodative credit supply conditions but also weak demand for credit.  Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative. In commercial real estate markets, loan growth at banks slowed further in January and February.  Financing con-ditions in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) markets remained accommodative, as issuance      was robust (relative to the usual seasonal slowdown) and CMBS spreads continued to be at low levels.  Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative for most borrowers, though credit con-ditions stayed tight for borrowers with low credit scores or with hard-to-document incomes.  Mortgage rates moved up, on net, over the period, along with the rise in other long-term rates.  Consumer credit grew at a solid pace in January follow-ing a rapid expansion in the fourth quarter.  Aggregate credit card balances continued to expand steadily in Jan-uary.  Nonetheless, for subprime borrowers, conditions remained tight, with credit limits and balances still low by historical standards.  Auto lending continued to grow at a moderate pace in recent months; although under-writing standards in the subprime segment continued to tighten, there were few signs of a significant restriction in credit supply for auto loans. Since the January FOMC meeting, foreign equity prices moved notably lower, on net, and generally declined more in the AFEs than in the United States.  Longer-term yields on sovereign debt in AFEs either decreased moderately or ended the period little changed, in con-trast to the increase in U.S. Treasury yields.  Weaker-than-expected economic data weighed on market-based measures of expected policy rate paths and on longer-term yields in Canada and in the euro area.  Communi-cations from the Bank of Canada also seemed to con-tribute to the decline in Canadian yields.  In the United Kingdom, longer-term yields were little changed, on net, although the market-based path of expected policy rates moved up moderately in response to Bank of England communications.  In emerging market economies (EMEs), sovereign yield spreads widened modestly, and flows into EME mutual funds were volatile over the pe-riod.  The broad nominal dollar index appreciated moderately over the period, largely reflecting an outsized deprecia-tion of the Canadian dollar and a massive devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.  (The Venezuelan government devalued the official Venezuelan exchange rate by more than 99 percent against the dollar, bringing the official rate closer to its black market value.)  Lower oil prices, weaker-than-expected economic data, and uncertainty over U.S. trade policy likely contributed to the weakness in the Canadian dollar.  In contrast, the Japanese yen ap-preciated against the dollar, in part supported by safe-haven demand.  Late in the intermeeting period, the Brit-ish pound was boosted by news of a preliminary agree-ment between U.K. and European Union authorities re-garding the transition period of the Brexit process, but the pound still ended the intermeeting period modestly weaker against the dollar. Staff Economic Outlook The staff projection for U.S. economic activity prepared for the March FOMC meeting was somewhat stronger, on balance, than the forecast at the time of the January meeting.  The near-term forecast for real GDP growth was revised down a little; the incoming spending data were a bit softer than the staff had expected, and the staff judged that the softness was not associated with re-sidual seasonality in the data.  However, the slowing in the pace of spending in the first quarter was expected to be transitory, and the medium-term projection for GDP growth was revised up modestly, largely reflecting the expected boost to GDP from the federal budget agree-ment enacted in February.  Real GDP was projected to increase at a faster pace than potential output through 2020.  The unemployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run below the staff\\'s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.  The projection for inflation over the medium term was revised up a bit, reflecting the slightly tighter resource utilization in the new forecast.  The rates of both total and core PCE price inflation were projected to be faster in 2018 than in 2017.  The staff projected that inflation would reach the Committee\\'s 2 percent objective in 2019. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.  On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater ex-pansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected.  On the downside, those fiscal policy changes could yield less impetus to the economy than the staff expected if the economy was already op-erating above its potential level and resource utilization continued to tighten, as the staff projected.  Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.  An up-side risk was that inflation could increase more than ex-pected in an economy that was projected to move fur-ther above its potential.  Downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of low core inflation readings last year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.        Participants\\' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2020 and over the longer run, based on their individual assess-ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  The longer-run projections represented each partici-pant\\'s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these minutes. In their discussion of economic conditions and the out-look, meeting participants agreed that information re-ceived since the FOMC met in January indicated that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate and that the labor market had continued to strengthen.  Job gains had been strong in recent months, and the unem-ployment rate had stayed low.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy continued to run below 2 percent.   Market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased in recent months but remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Participants noted incoming data suggesting some slow-ing in the rate of growth of household spending and business fixed investment after strong fourth-quarter readings.  However, they expected that the first-quarter softness would be transitory, pointing to a variety of fac-tors, including delayed payment of some personal tax re-funds, residual seasonality in the data, and more gener-ally to strong economic fundamentals.  Among the fun-damentals that participants cited were high levels of con-sumer and business sentiment, supportive financial con-ditions, improved economic conditions abroad, and re-cent changes in fiscal policy.  Participants generally saw the news on spending and the labor market over the past few quarters as being consistent with continued above-trend growth and a further strengthening in labor mar-kets.  Participants expected that, with further gradual in-creases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year and a moderate pace in the medium term, and that labor market conditions would remain strong.  Inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee\\'s 2 per-cent objective over the medium term.  Several partici-pants noted that the 12-month PCE price inflation rate would likely shift upward when the March data are re-leased because the effects of the outsized decline in the prices of cell phone service plans in March of last year will drop out of that calculation.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared to be roughly balanced, but participants agreed that it would be important to con-tinue to monitor inflation developments closely. Many participants reported considerable optimism among the business contacts in their Districts, consistent with a firming in business expenditures.  Respondents to District surveys in both the manufacturing and service sectors were generally upbeat about the economic out-look.  In some Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to continuing short-ages of workers in segments of the labor market.  Activ-ity in the energy sector continued to expand, with con-tacts suggesting that further increases were likely, pro-vided that sufficient labor resources were forthcoming.  In contrast, contacts in the agricultural sector reported that farm income continued to experience downward pressure due to low crop prices. A number of participants reported concern among their business contacts about the possible ramifications of the recent imposition of tariffs on imported steel and alumi-num.  Participants did not see the steel and aluminum tariffs, by themselves, as likely to have a significant effect on the national economic outlook, but a strong majority of participants viewed the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries, as well as other issues and uncertainties associated with trade policies, as downside risks for the U.S. economy.  Contacts in the agricultural sector reported feeling particularly vulnerable to retalia-tion. Tax changes enacted late last year and the recent federal budget agreement, taken together, were expected to pro-vide a significant boost to output over the next few years.  However, participants generally regarded the magnitude and timing of the economic effects of the fis-cal policy changes as uncertain, partly because there have been few historical examples of expansionary fiscal pol-icy being implemented when the economy was operating at a high level of resource utilization.  A number of par-ticipants also suggested that uncertainty about whether all elements of the tax cuts would be made permanent, or about the implications of higher budget deficits for fiscal sustainability and real interest rates, represented sources of downside risk to the economic outlook.  A      few participants noted that the changes in tax policy could boost the level of potential output. Most participants described labor market conditions as strong, noting that payroll gains had remained well above the pace regarded as consistent with absorbing new labor force entrants over time, the unemployment rate had stayed low, job openings had been high, or that initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had been low.  Many participants observed that the labor force participation rate had been higher recently than they had expected, helping to keep the unemployment rate flat over the past few months despite strong payroll gains.  The firmness in the overall participation rate-relative to its demographically driven downward trend-and the rising participation rate of prime-age adults were regarded as signs of continued strengthening in labor market conditions. A few participants thought that these favorable developments could continue for a time, whereas others expressed doubts.  A few participants warned against inferring too much from comparisons of the current low level of the unemployment rate with his-torical benchmarks, arguing that the much higher levels of education of today\\'s workforce-and the lower aver-age unemployment rate of more highly educated work-ers than less educated workers-suggested that the U.S. economy might be able to sustain lower unemployment rates than was the case in the 1950s or 1960s. In some Districts, reports from business contacts or ev-idence from surveys pointed to a pickup in wages, par-ticularly for unskilled or entry-level workers.  However, business contacts or national surveys led a few partici-pants to conclude that some businesses facing labor shortages were changing job requirements so that they matched more closely the skills of available workers, in-creasing training, or offering more flexible work arrange-ments, rather than increasing wages in a broad-based fashion.  Regarding wage growth at the national level, several participants noted a modest increase, but most still described the pace of wage gains as moderate; a few participants cited this fact as suggesting that there was room for the labor market to strengthen somewhat fur-ther. In some Districts, surveys or business contacts reported increases in nonwage costs, particularly in the cost of materials, and in a few Districts, contacts reported pass-ing on some of those costs in the form of higher prices.  Contacts in a few Districts suggested that widely known, observable cost increases-such as those associated with rising commodity prices-would be more likely to be ac-cepted and passed through to final goods prices than would less observable costs such as wage increases.  A few participants argued that either an absence of pricing power among at least some firms-perhaps stemming from globalization and technological innovations, in-cluding ones that facilitate price comparisons-or the ability of firms to find ways to cut costs of production has been damping inflationary pressures.  Many partici-pants stated that recent readings from indicators on in-flation and inflation expectations increased their confi-dence that inflation would rise to the Committee\\'s 2 per-cent objective in coming months and then stabilize around that level; others suggested that downside risks to inflation were subsiding.  In contrast, a few partici-pants cautioned that, despite increases in market-based measures of inflation compensation in recent months and the stabilization of some survey measures of infla-tion expectations, the levels of these indicators remained too low to be consistent with the Committee\\'s 2 percent inflation objective. In their discussion of developments in financial markets, some participants observed that financial conditions re-mained accommodative despite the rise in market vola-tility and repricing of assets that had occurred in Febru-ary.  Many participants reported that their contacts had taken the previous month\\'s turbulence in stride, al-though a few participants suggested that financial devel-opments over the intermeeting period highlighted some downside risks associated with still-high valuations for equities or from market volatility more generally.  A few participants expressed concern that a lengthy period in which the economy operates beyond potential and fi-nancial conditions remain highly accommodative could, over time, pose risks to financial stability. In their consideration of monetary policy, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and finan-cial developments for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.  All participants agreed that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strength-ened in recent months.  In addition, all participants ex-pected inflation on a 12-month basis to move up in com-ing months.  This expectation partly reflected the arith-metic effect of the soft readings on inflation in early 2017 dropping out of the calculation; it was noted that the increase in the inflation rate arising from this source was widely expected and, by itself, would not justify a change in the projected path for the federal funds rate.  Most participants commented that the stronger eco-nomic outlook and the somewhat higher inflation read-ings in recent months had increased the likelihood of progress toward the Committee\\'s 2 percent inflation ob-jective.  A few participants suggested that a modest in-     flation overshoot might help push up longer-term infla-tion expectations and anchor them at a level consistent with the Committee\\'s 2 percent inflation objective.  A number of participants offered their views on the poten-tial benefits and costs associated with an economy oper-ating well above potential for a prolonged period while inflation remained low.  On the one hand, the associated tightness in the labor market might help speed the return of inflation to the Committee\\'s 2 percent goal and in-duce a further increase in labor force participation; on the other hand, an overheated economy could result in significant inflation pressures or lead to financial insta-bility.   Based on their current assessments, almost all partici-pants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting.  These partic-ipants agreed that, even after such an increase in the tar-get range, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting strong labor market condi-tions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.  A couple of participants pointed to possible benefits of postponing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate until a subsequent meeting; these participants suggested that waiting for additional data to provide more evidence of a sustained return of the 12-month in-flation rate to 2 percent might more clearly demonstrate the data dependence of the Committee\\'s decisions and its resolve to achieve the price-stability component of its dual mandate. With regard to the medium-term outlook for monetary policy, all participants saw some further firming of the stance of monetary policy as likely to be warranted.  Al-most all participants agreed that it remained appropriate to follow a gradual approach to raising the target range for the federal funds rate.  Several participants com-mented that this gradual approach was most likely to be conducive to maintaining strong labor market condi-tions and returning inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis without resulting in conditions that would eventu-ally require an abrupt policy tightening.  A number of participants indicated that the stronger outlook for eco-nomic activity, along with their increased confidence that inflation would return to 2 percent over the medium term, implied that the appropriate path for the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely be slightly steeper than they had previously expected.  Participants agreed that the longer-run normal federal funds rate was likely lower than in the past, in part because of secular forces that had put downward pressure on real interest rates.  Several participants expressed the judgment that it would likely become appropriate at some point for the Committee to set the federal funds rate above its longer-run normal value for a time.  Some participants sug-gested that, at some point, it might become necessary to revise statement language to acknowledge that, in pur-suit of the Committee\\'s statutory mandate and con-sistent with the median of participants\\' policy rate pro-jections in the SEP, monetary policy eventually would likely gradually move from an accommodative stance to being a neutral or restraining factor for economic activ-ity.  However, participants expressed a range of views on the amount of policy tightening that would likely be re-quired over the medium term to achieve the Commit-tee\\'s goals.  Participants agreed that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in January indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate.  Job gains had been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low.  Recent data suggested that growth rates of household spending and business fixed invest-ment had moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had continued to run below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased in re-cent months but remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. All members viewed the recent data and other develop-ments bearing on real economic activity as suggesting that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months.  In addition, notwithstanding increased market volatility over the in-termeeting period, financial conditions had stayed ac-commodative, and developments since the January meeting had indicated that fiscal policy was likely to pro-vide greater impetus to the economy over the next few years than members had previously thought.  Conse-quently, members expected that, with further gradual ad-justments in the stance of monetary policy, economic ac-tivity would expand at a moderate pace in the medium term, and labor market conditions would remain strong.    Members generally continued to judge the risks to the economic outlook as remaining roughly balanced. Most members noted that recent readings on inflation, along with the strengthening of the economic outlook,      provided support for the view that inflation on a  12-month basis would likely move up in coming months and stabilize around the Committee\\'s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely. After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-bers voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent.  They indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sus-tained return to 2 percent inflation. Members agreed that the timing and size of future ad-justments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and ex-pected economic conditions relative to the Committee\\'s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-flation.  They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of infla-tion pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  Members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the Committee\\'s symmetric inflation goal.  Members ex-pected that economic conditions would evolve in a man-ner that would warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.  They judged that raising the target range gradually would balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment and was most likely to support continued economic expansion.  Members agreed that the strengthening in the economic outlook in recent months increased the likelihood that a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be ap-propriate.  Members continued to anticipate that the fed-eral funds rate would likely remain, for some time, below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run.  Nonetheless, they again stated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: ﬁEffective March 22, 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under-take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1½ to 1¾ percent, including overnight re-verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur-chase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate week-end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.50 percent, in amounts lim-ited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve\\'s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during March that exceeds $12 billion, and to continue rein-vesting in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve\\'s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during March that exceeds $8 billion.  Effective in April, the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at auction the amount of principal pay-ments from the Federal Reserve\\'s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calen-dar month that exceeds $18 billion, and to rein-vest in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve\\'s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $12 billion.  Small deviations from these amounts for oper-ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve\\'s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.ﬂ The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: ﬁInformation received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.  Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.  Recent data suggest that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment have moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to      run below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.  The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong.  Inflation on a 12-month basis is ex-pected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee\\'s 2 percent ob-jective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly bal-anced, but the Committee is monitoring infla-tion developments closely. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee de-cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market condi-tions and a sustained return to 2 percent infla-tion. In determining the timing and size of future ad-justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-count a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international de-velopments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation develop-ments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic condi-tions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.ﬂ Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, William C. Dudley, Thomas I.

This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 2¼ percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of March 22, 2018, and the date such Reserve Banks informed the Secretary of the Board of such a request.  (Secretary\\'s note:  Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and Min-neapolis were informed by the Secretary of the Board of the Board\\'s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 2¼ percent, effective March 22, 2018.)  The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establish-ment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates.      Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-tee (FOMC) meeting held on March 20Œ21, 2018, meet-ing participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 to 2020 and over the longer run.1  Each participant\\'s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy-includ-ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value-and assumptions about other factors likely to af-fect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projections represent each participant\\'s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab-sence of further shocks to the economy.2  ﬁAppropriate monetary policyﬂ is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster out-comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat-isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. All participants who submitted longer-run projections expected that real GDP in 2018 would expand at a pace exceeding their individual estimates of the longer-run growth rate of real GDP.  Participants generally saw real GDP growth moderating somewhat in each of the fol-lowing two years, with almost all participants who sub-mitted longer-run projections anticipating that real GDP growth in 2020 would be at or within a few tenths of a percentage point of their longer-run estimates.  All par-ticipants who submitted longer-run projections expected that, throughout the projection period, the unemploy-ment rate would run below their estimates of its longer-run level.  All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would rise to or toward the Committee\\'s 2 per-cent objective this year and would be at or a little above that objective by 2020.  Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from December, a sub-stantial majority of participants marked up their projec-tions for real GDP growth and lowered their projections for the unemployment rate; participants indicated that these revisions reflected a number of factors, such as                                                  1 Three members of the Board of Governors were in office at the time of the March 2018 meeting, one member fewer than in December 2017. changes in fiscal policy, a stronger outlook for economic growth abroad, or recent strong job gains.  For inflation, a majority of participants made slight upward revisions to their projections; these revisions were attributed to re-cent price data and the effects of a stronger economic outlook than in the December SEP.  Table 1 and fig-ure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. As shown in figure 2, participants generally continued to expect that the evolution of the economy relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-flation would likely warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.  Although the median of partici-pants\\' projections for the federal funds rate at the end of 2018 was unchanged relative to the December SEP, a number of participants marked up their projections for this year.  Moreover, a substantial majority of partici-pants revised up their federal funds rate projections for 2019 and 2020.  The median of participants\\' projections for the longer-run level of the federal funds rate was slightly higher relative to the December SEP.  Nearly all participants who submitted longer-run projections ex-pected that evolving economic conditions would make it appropriate for the federal funds rate to move above their estimates of its longer-run level during part of the projection period. In general, participants continued to view the uncer-tainty attached to their economic projections as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years.  As in Decem-ber, most participants judged the risks around their pro-jections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation to be broadly balanced. The Outlook for Economic Activity The median of participants\\' projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assess-ments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.7 percent for this year and 2.4 percent for next year.  The median projection for real GDP growth in 2020 was 2.0 percent, a touch above the 1.8 percent median of participants\\' longer-run estimates.  Most participants cited federal fis-cal policy developments-specifically, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018-as boosting their projections for economic ac-tivity over the next couple of years.  Several participants mentioned other factors that influenced their economic 2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate.

Compared with the December SEP, the medians of par-ticipants\\' projections for real GDP growth this year and next year were up a few tenths of a percentage point. Consistent with their projections for economic activity, almost all participants expected labor market conditions to strengthen further over the projection period.  The medians of projections for the unemployment rate showed that rate stepping down from 4.1 percent in the final quarter of 2017 to 3.8 percent in the final quarter of this year, and then to 3.6 percent in the final quarters of 2019 and 2020.  The median of participants\\' estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate was 4.5 percent.  Compared with the December SEP, almost all partici-pants marked down their unemployment rate projec-tions.  Some participants also lowered their estimates of the longer-run level of the unemployment rate, leading to a small decline in the corresponding median projec-tion. Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-pants\\' projections for real GDP growth and the unem-ployment rate from 2018 to 2020 and in the longer run.  The distributions of individual projections for real GDP growth this year and next year shifted up noticeably from those in the December SEP; participants\\' projections ranged from 2.5 to 3.0 percent in 2018 and from 2.0 to 2.8 percent in 2019.  By contrast, the distributions of projected real GDP growth in 2020 and in the longer run shifted up modestly since December.  Consistent with participants\\' generally more upbeat outlook for real GDP growth, the distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate were lower than the corre-sponding distributions in December for each year of the projection period. The Outlook for Inflation The medians of participants\\' projections for both total and core PCE price inflation were 1.9 percent in 2018-with all participants anticipating that each measure would rise from its 2017 rate-and 2.1 percent by 2020.  Compared with the December SEP, the medians of par-ticipants\\' projections for each measure were unchanged this year and up 0.1 percentage point in 2020. Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-butions of participants\\' views about the outlook for in-flation.  Participants generally made minor upward ad-justments to their inflation projections, resulting in slight shifts of the distributions to the right relative to the dis-tributions in December.  Participants generally expected each measure to increase to no more than 2 percent this year and to rise to, or edge above, 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants\\' judgments regarding the appropriate target-or mid-point of the target range-for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2018 to 2020 and in the longer run.  The distributions of projected policy rates through 2020 shifted modestly higher, consistent with the revi-sions to participants\\' projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  For 2018, there was a notable reduction in the dispersion of participants\\' views, with most participants now regarding the appro-priate target at the end of the year as being between 2.13 and 2.62 percent.  For each subsequent year, the disper-sion of participants\\' year-end projections was somewhat greater than that in the December SEP, and the range of participants\\' projections was noticeably larger than for 2018. The median of participants\\' projections of the federal funds rate rises gradually to a level of 2.1 percent at the end of this year, 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2020.  The median of partici-pants\\' longer-run estimates, at 2.9 percent, was a bit higher than in the December SEP.  Nearly all partici-pants projected that it would likely be appropriate for the federal funds rate to rise above their individual longer-run estimates at some point over the forecast pe-riod. In discussing their projections, many participants con-tinued to express the view that the appropriate trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely involve gradual increases.  This view was predi-cated on several factors, including a judgment that a gradual path likely would appropriately balance the risks associated with, among other considerations, the possi-bility that inflation pressures and financial imbalances could build if economic activity were to run well above its long-run sustainable level and the possibility that the forces depressing inflation could prove to be more per-sistent than currently anticipated.  Another factor men-tioned was the view that the neutral real interest rate was historically low and would likely move up only slowly.  As always, the appropriate path of the federal funds rate would depend on evolving economic conditions and their implications for participants\\' economic outlooks and assessments of risks.

Uncertainty and Risks In assessing the path for the federal funds rate that, in their view, is likely to be appropriate, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic out-comes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the poten-tial benefits and costs should they occur.  As a reference, table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty, based on the forecast errors of various private and government forecasts over the past 20 years, for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE inflation.  Those measures are represented graphically in the ﬁfan chartsﬂ shown in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  The fan charts display the median SEP projections for the three variables surrounded by symmetric confidence in-tervals derived from the forecast errors reported in ta-ble 2.  If the degree of uncertainty attending these pro-jections is similar to the typical magnitude of past fore-cast errors and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then future outcomes of these varia-bles would have about a 70 percent probability of being within these confidence intervals.  For all three variables, this measure of uncertainty is substantial and generally increases as the forecast horizon lengthens. Participants\\' assessments of the level of uncertainty sur-rounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Nearly all participants viewed the degree of uncer-tainty attached to their economic projections about real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, a view that was essentially unchanged from December.3 Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric around the median projections, they do not reflect any asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections.  Participants\\' assess-ments of the balance of risks to their economic projec-tions are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig-ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  As in December, most partici-pants judged the risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, total inflation, and core inflation as broadly balanced-in other words, as broadly consistent with a symmetric fan chart.  Partici-pants who saw the risks as skewed typically judged that the balance of risks was tilted toward stronger GDP growth, lower unemployment rates, and higher inflation.  Compared with the December SEP, participants\\' assess-ments of the balance of risks attending their projections                                                  3 At the end of this summary, the box ﬁForecast Uncertaintyﬂ discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur-rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach Table 2.

In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their projections, most participants noted that the magnitude and timing of the economic effects of recent changes in fiscal policy were uncertain or that fiscal policy develop-ments posed upside risks to real economic activity.  Most participants also cited trade policy as a source of either uncertainty or downside risk.  A few participants noted that a prolonged period of tight labor markets posed risks of higher inflation, could fuel financial imbalances, and might contribute to heightened recession risks. Participants\\' assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty.  Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective devel-opments over time in real GDP growth, the unemploy-ment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the partici-pants\\' projections.

    projected path for the federal funds rate importantly re-flects the uncertainties about the paths for those key eco-nomic variables.  Figure 5 provides a graphical represen-tation of this uncertainty, plotting the median SEP pro-jection  for  the federal funds rate surrounded  by  confi-dence intervals derived from the results presented in ta-ble 2.  As with the macroeconomic variables, forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the fed-eral funds rate is substantial and increases for longer ho-rizons.

Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however.  The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-tial costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\\'s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.5 to 4.5 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the second and third years.  The corre-sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla-tion would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year.  Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confi-dence bounds in ﬁfan chartsﬂ that are symmetric and cen-tered on the medians of FOMC participants\\' projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  How-ever, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric.  In particular, the unemployment rate can-not be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the down-side, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants\\' cur-rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-ticipants\\' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant\\'s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-comes but rather are projections of participants\\' individual as-sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy. If at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.   '"
