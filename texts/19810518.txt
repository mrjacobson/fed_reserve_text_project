The report of examination of the System Open Market Account, made by the Board's Division of Federal Reserve Bank Operations as of the close of business November 21, 1980, was accepted.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period March 31 through May 17, 1981, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:-2 - 5/18/81The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP will grow much less rapidly in the current quarter, following the substantial expansion in the first quarter; prices on the average have continued to rise rapidly, although somewhat less so most recently than earlier in the year. The dollar value of total retail sales increased slightly further in March, but it declined appreciably in April when sales of new cars fell in response to the ending of price concessions.  Industrial production rose moderately in both months, while nonfarm payroll employment changed little, after adjustment for strikes, and the unemployment rate was stable at 7.3 percent. In March housing starts remained at a reduced pace.  Over the first four months of 1981, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was slightly less rapid than during 1980.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen steadily since the end of March to its highest level in three and a half years. The U.S.  trade deficit declined sharply in March, bringing the firstquarter deficit to a level well below the 1980 average.  Growth in M-1B, adjusted for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, accelerated sharply in April and growth in M-2 remained rapid. Since March, both short-term and long-term market interest rates have risen substantially.  On May 4 the Board of Governors announced an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 13 to 14 percent and an increase in the surcharge from 3 to 4 percentage points on frequent borrowings of large institutions.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote economic growth, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 within ranges of 3 to 5 percent, 31 to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6½ to 9½ percent respectively, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.  In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with a substantial deceleration of growth in M-1B from April to June to an annual rate of 3 percent or lower, after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts, and with growth in M-2 at an annual rate of about 6 percent.-3 - 5/18/81The shortfall in growth of M-1B from the two-month rate specified above would be acceptable, in light of the rapid growth in April and the objective adopted by the Committee on March 31 for growth from March to June at an annual rate of 5 percent or somewhat less. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M-1B to an unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 16 to 22 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, July 7, 1981, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary-4 -
