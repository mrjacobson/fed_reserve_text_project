By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period July 16 through August 12, 1968, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that some elements of economic activity continued to expand vigorously in early summer. Expansion in overall activity, however, is projected to slow considerably in coming months as a result of the new fiscal restraint measures and a marked reduction in inventory accumulation.  Industrial prices have been increasing less rapidly in recent months, but consumer prices have continued to rise substantially. Wage pressures remain strong, and the recent wage settlement in the steel industry was followed by announcements of steel price increases.  Both short- and long-term interest rates have declined considerably, in large part as a result of expectations of easier credit conditions. Bank time and savings deposits, particularly large-denomination CD's, have expanded sharply in early summer; growth in the money supply has continued large as U.S. Government deposits have been drawn down further on average; and growth in total bank credit has been unusually rapid. Although the U.S. balance of payments has recently shown a marked improvement, the foreign trade balance and underlying payments position continue to be matters of serious concern. In this situation, it is the policy of the 8/13/68Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable economic growth, continued resistance to inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining, on balance, about the prevailing conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be significantly exceeding current projections.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, September 10, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
