With Mr. Maisel dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: 12/12/67The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that industrial output and employment have rebounded following strike settlements in the automobile and other industries, and that prospects have heightened for more rapid expansion of over-all economic activity in the months ahead. Both industrial and consumer prices have continued to rise at a substantial rate. The imbalance in U.S. international transactions has worsened, partly because of weakening in the export surplus since midyear.  Foreign purchases of gold have been large following the devaluation of the pound sterling. Bank credit expansion has lessened, with diminished bank buying of Government securities and continued moderate loan growth. Most interest rates have risen further in reaction to the British devaluation and Bank rate increase, the rise in Federal Reserve discount rates, and waning expectations of enactment of the President's fiscal program. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resistance of inflationary pressures and progress toward reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to moving slightly beyond the firmer conditions that have developed in money markets partly as a result of the increase in Federal Reserve discount rates; provided, however, that operations shall be modified as needed to moderate any apparently significant deviations of bank credit from current expectations or any unusual liquidity pressures.  It was agreed the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, January 9, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
