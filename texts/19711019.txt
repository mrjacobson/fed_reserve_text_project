By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that real output of goods and services expanded modestly in the third quarter and that unemployment remained substantial. However, there are indications of a strengthening in economic activity since the mid-August announcement of the Government's new economic program. The 90-day freeze has thus far effectively limited increases in prices and wages, and the general framework of the post-freeze stabilization program has been established. The narrowly defined money stock, which had grown rapidly through July, increased much less in August and declined in September. The broadly defined money stock increased slightly in September as inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to banks continued at the moderate August rate. However, the volume of large-denomination CD's outstanding rose sharply, and the rate of expansion in the bank credit 10/19/71proxy remained relatively rapid. Market interest rates have declined in recent weeks and are appreciably below their mid-August levels. The U.S. foreign trade balance remained in heavy deficit in August. Outflows of shortterm capital, which had been massive in August, were much smaller in September. In recent weeks the market exchange rates for some foreign currencies against the dollar rose further, while foreign official reserve holdings increased substantially. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions consistent with the aims of the new governmental program, including sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to achieve moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over the months ahead. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to achieving bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with that objective, taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, November 16, 1971, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
