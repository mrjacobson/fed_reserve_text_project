However, the economic program announced by the President on August 15 enhances prospects for higher rates of growth in real economic activity, increased job opportunities, and curtailed inflationary pressures. In July inflows of consumertype time and savings funds slowed markedly at banks but inflows to nonbank thrift institutions continued large. Growth in the narrowly defined money stock remained rapid in July, but growth in broadly defined money slowed and bank credit continued to expand at about the second-quarter pace. Interest rates on most types of market securities declined sharply in the days following the announcement of the new program.  The deficit in the U.S. balance of payments reached extraordinarily large proportions in early August, mainly reflecting an acceleration of capital outflows related to expectations of shifts in foreign exchange rates. Following the suspension of convertibility of the dollar into gold and other reserve assets, major European central banks discontinued foreign exchange market operations for a week. When most of the European markets were reopened on August 23 these central banks pursued diverse exchange rate policies, but all allowed at least some types of market transactions to take place at rates of exchange for their currencies relative to the dollar above previous upper intervention limits. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions consistent with the aims of the new governmental program, including sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to achieve more moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over the months ahead. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to achieving bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with that objective.  By unanimous vote, paragraph 1(a) of the continuing authority directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with respect to domestic open market operations was amended to read as follows: 8/24/71To buy or sell U.S. Government securities and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; provided that the aggregate amount of U.S. Government and Federal agency securities held in such Account at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action is taken with respect to a current economic policy directive shall not be increased or decreased by more than $2.0 billion during the period commencing with the opening of business on the day following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting.  In connection with the foregoing action, the Committee approved certain guidelines for the conduct of System operations in the securities of Federal agencies.  Secretary's Note: It was understood that decisions with respect to the implementation of outright operations in agency issues, and the announcement thereof, would be made by Chairman Burns after consultation with the System Account Manager.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, September 21, 1971, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
