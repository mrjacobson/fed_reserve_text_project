Secretary's note: On December 1, and 17, 1980, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee approved provisions to effect the indicated changes in terms of the swap agreements, with a proviso that interest rates be based on instruments as closely comparable as possible to U. S. Treasury bills.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period October 21 through November 17, 1980, were ratified.  With Mrs. Teeters and Mr. Winn dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance withthe following domestic policy directive:-3 - 11/18/80The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP is recovering further in the fourth quarter from the sharp contraction in the second quarter, while prices on the average continue to rise rapidly. In October industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment expanded substantially for the third consecutive month, and the unemployment rate remained around 7 percent. The value of retail sales changed little, following four months of recovery. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings over the first ten months of 1980 was somewhat more rapid than in 1979.  The weighted average value of the dollar in exchange markets on balance has risen further over the past month.  The U.S. trade deficit was essentially unchanged in September, and the rate in the third quarter was sharply lower than that in the first half.  Growth in M-1A and M-1B moderated further in October but was still relatively rapid; growth in M-2 accelerated slightly, reflecting a pickup in expansion of its nontransactions component. From the fourth quarter of 1979 to October, growth of M-1A was in the upper part of the range set by the Committee for growth over the year ending in the fourth quarter of 1980, while growth of M-1B and M-2 was somewhat above the upper limits of their ranges.  Expansion in commercial bank credit was rapid in October, although not so rapid as in August and September. Market interest rates have risen sharply in recent weeks; average rates on new home mortgage commitments have continued upward.  On November 14 the Board of Governors announced an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 11 to 12 percent and a surcharge of 2 percentage points on frequent borrowing of large member banks from Federal Reserve banks.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3 to 6 percent, 4 to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. For the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981, the Committee looked toward a reduction in the ranges for growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 on the order of percentage point from the ranges adopted for 1980, abstracting from institutional influences affecting the behavior of the aggregates. These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.-4 - 11/18/80In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 over the period from September to December at annual rates of about 2 percent, 5 percent, and 7-3/4 percent respectively, or somewhat less, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 13 to 17 percent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Friday, December 19, 1980, beginning at 9:30 a..m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary-5 -
