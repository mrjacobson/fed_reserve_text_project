By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities and agency obligations during the period March 26, 1985, through May 20, 1985, were ratified.  With Mr. Black dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 5/21/85The information reviewed at this meeting suggests only a modest pick-up in real GNP in the current quarter from the reduced rate of growth in the first quarter. Total retail sales rose in April to a level somewhat above the average for the first quarter, and housing starts increased further after rising substantially in the first quarter. Information on business capital spending suggests further growth, though at a much less rapid pace than earlier in the economic expansion. Industrial production declined slightly in April after rising little over the first quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a somewhat reduced pace in April with employment in manufacturing registering another decline. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent in April. Broad measures of prices and wages appear to be rising at rates close to those recorded in 1984.  Since the Committee's meeting in late March, the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has continued to fluctuate widely in often volatile market conditions and has declined moderately on balance. The trade and current account deficits widened in the first quarter as a rebound in non-oil imports from their low fourth-quarter level extended the pattern of sharp quarter-to-quarter swings experienced since the beginning of 1984.  Growth in M1 slowed markedly in March from the rapid pace of earlier months and remained moderate in April. The broader aggregates showed little change in April after their growth had slowed appreciably in March. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has remained relatively rapid. Interest rates have declined considerably since the March meeting of the Committee. On May 17, the Federal Reserve Board approved a reduction in the discount rate from 8 to 7-1/2 percent.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at its meeting-3- 5/21/85in February to establish ranges for monetary growth of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 9 to 12 percent for the year 1985. The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary aggregates in the upper part of their ranges for 1985 may be appropriate, depending on developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, and against the background of the recent reduction in the discount rate, the Committee seeks to maintain about the same degree of pressure on bank reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in Ml at an annual rate of around 6 percent or a little higher during the period from March to June, while M2 and M3, in the light of their weakness in April, are expected to grow more slowly over the quarter than the 7 and 8 percent annual rates, respectively, anticipated earlier. Somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth of the monetary aggregates while somewhat greater restraint might be acceptable in the event of substantially higher growth. In either case such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent. 5/21/85It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, July 9-10, 1985.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
