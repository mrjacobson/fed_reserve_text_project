Developments in Financial Markets, Open Market Operations, and Policy Normalization  The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and for-eign financial markets.  The deputy manager followed with a briefing on money market developments and Sys-tem open market operations conducted by the Open Market Desk during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on July 28Œ29.  Daily take-up in the Desk's overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations declined somewhat, apart from month-ends, likely reflecting some increase in money market interest rates.  The deputy manager also dis-cussed recent test operations of the Term Deposit Facil-ity and updated the Committee on plans for tests of term reverse repurchase agreement operations at the end of the third quarter. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-cies for the System's account over the intermeeting pe-riod. System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy A staff briefing provided background on the macroeco-nomic effects of alternative approaches to ceasing rein-vestments of principal on securities held in the SOMA after the Committee begins to normalize the stance of policy by increasing the target range for the federal funds rate.  The briefing presented analysis that was based on an assumption that the cessation of reinvestments, once implemented, would be permanent.  The briefing sug-gested that if economic conditions evolved in line with a modal outlook, differences in macroeconomic outcomes would be minor across approaches that ceased reinvest-ments soon after initial policy firming or continued rein-vestments until certain levels of the federal funds rate, such as 1 percent or 2 percent, were reached.  As a result, the appropriate path of the federal funds rate would be only modestly affected.  However, if substantial adverse shocks occurred, continuing reinvestment until normal-ization of the level of the federal funds rate was well un-der way could help avoid situations that would warrant a larger reduction in the federal funds rate than perhaps could be accomplished given the constraint posed by the effective lower bound to nominal interest rates. In the ensuing discussion, participants considered the advantages and disadvantages of alternative approaches to reinvestment.  Participants referred to the Commit-tee's statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, which indicates that the timing of the cessation or phasing out of reinvestments will depend on how eco-nomic and financial conditions and the economic out-look evolve.  Several participants emphasized that con-tinuing reinvestments for some time after the initial pol-icy firming could help manage potential risks, particu-larly by reducing the probability that the federal funds rate might return to the effective lower bound.  Some participants expressed a view that, in contrast to the as-sumption in the staff analysis, the Committee could choose to resume reinvestments if macroeconomic con-ditions warranted.  At the same time, it was also high-lighted that a larger balance sheet could entail costs, and that the Principles and Plans indicate that, in the longer run, the SOMA portfolio should be no larger than nec- essary to conduct monetary policy efficiently and effec-tively.  The Committee made no decisions regarding its strategy for ceasing or phasing out reinvestments at this meeting. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the September 16Œ17 meeting suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) was expanding at a moderate pace in the third quarter.  Labor market conditions continued to improve, but labor compensation gains were modest.  Consumer price inflation remained below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent and was restrained by further declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices.  Survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations re-mained stable, while market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in July and August.  The unemployment rate stayed at 5.3 percent in July but fell to 5.1 percent in August.  With the labor force participation rate unchanged over this period, the employment-to-population ratio edged up.  The share of workers employed part time for eco-nomic reasons remained elevated.  The rate of private-sector job openings increased in July and was at a high level, while the rates of hiring and quits were little changed. Industrial production increased, on balance, during July and August.  Manufacturing production fell in August primarily because of a large drop in the output of motor vehicles and parts that reversed a substantial portion of its jump in July.  Automakers scheduled further declines in assemblies over the remainder of the year, and broader indicators of manufacturing production, includ-ing readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, generally suggested that factory output would be little changed over that period.  Mining output moved up, on net, in July and August after a steep decline in the second quarter. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-peared to be rising at a moderate pace in the third quar-ter.  The components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimates of PCE increased at a strong rate in July and August, and sales of light motor vehicles moved up in both months.  Household spending was supported by moderate growth in real disposable income in July and a wealth-to-income ratio that remained high even after re-cent declines in equity values.  Consumer sentiment in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers de-creased in early September, reportedly in part because of the recent decline in stock market prices, but it remained above its year-earlier level. Activity in the housing sector remained on a gradual up-ward trend.  Starts of new single-family homes rose fur-ther early in the third quarter and were slightly above the pace of permit issuance.  In the multifamily sector, starts fell back after having been temporarily elevated in June.  Sales of new and existing homes both increased in July. Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-tellectual property products appeared to be rising mod-erately.  Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in July, and orders for non-defense capital goods pointed to modest gains in ship-ments in the coming months, consistent with recent readings from surveys of business conditions.  Real spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining increased sharply in the second quarter, and nominal business expenditures for such structures rose further in July.  In contrast, real business spending for drilling and mining structures fell steeply in the second quarter.  Available indicators of drilling activity, such as counts of rigs in operation, suggested spending would decline less rapidly in the third quarter. Total real government purchases appeared to be declin-ing slightly in the third quarter.  Federal government pur-chases likely decreased, as defense spending moved down further through August.  State and local govern-ment purchases seemed to be increasing, on balance, as the payrolls of these governments expanded at a faster pace in July and August than in the second quarter, while their nominal construction expenditures edged down in July after a large gain in the second quarter. The U.S. international trade deficit widened in June be-fore narrowing substantially in July.  Exports rose in July, supported by increased shipments of non-aircraft capital goods and automobiles, but remained subdued.  In con-trast, imports declined in July, reversing a June increase, as imports of consumer goods fell back. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, edged up over the 12 months ending in July, restrained importantly by declines in energy prices.  Core PCE prices, which exclude food and energy prices, in-creased 1¼ percent over the same period, with the in-crease damped in part by declines in the prices of non-energy imports.  Over the 12 months ending in August, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) edged up, while the core CPI increased 1¾ percent.  Measures of expected longer-run inflation from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan survey,  the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable.  However, market-based measures of inflation compensation fell to near their historical lows, reportedly in response to the recent appreciation of the dollar, the decline in oil prices, and readings on realized inflation that were slightly be-low market expectations. Measures of labor compensation rose faster than con-sumer prices over the past year, but the modest increases in compensation were similar to those seen in recent years.  Over the four quarters ending in the second quar-ter, the employment cost index increased nearly 2 per-cent and compensation per hour in the nonfarm busi-ness sector rose 2¼ percent.  Over the 12 months end-ing in August, average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2¼ percent. Foreign economic growth remained weak in the second quarter, held back by contractions in real GDP in Can-ada, Japan, Brazil, and Taiwan, even as activity continued to expand at a moderate pace in the euro area and the United Kingdom.  Indicators for the third quarter pointed to a slight pickup in the pace of foreign growth, particularly as recent data for Canada suggested that some of the first-half weakness there was dissipating.  However, recent indicators for some other countries, most notably China, were subdued.  Inflation rates con-tinued to be quite low in the advanced foreign econo-mies, and market-based measures of inflation compen-sation had recently moved down in the euro area and Japan.  In contrast, inflation in the emerging market economies had risen in recent months as a result of higher food prices and widespread currency deprecia-tion. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Although U.S. economic data releases generally met market expectations, domestic financial conditions tight-ened modestly as concerns about prospects for global economic growth, centered on China, prompted an in-crease in financial market volatility and a deterioration in risk sentiment during the intermeeting period.  Stock market indexes in most advanced and emerging market economies ended the period sharply lower.  Tighter fi-nancial market conditions and greater volatility contrib-uted to a reduction of the odds that market participants appeared to place on the first increase in the federal funds rate occurring at the September FOMC meeting and to a flatter expected path for the policy rate thereaf-ter.  Nevertheless, yields on short- and longer-term nom-inal Treasury securities were modestly higher than when the Committee met in July. Over the intermeeting period, the concerns about global economic growth and turbulence in financial markets led to greater uncertainty among market participants about the likely timing of the start of the normalization of the stance of U.S. monetary policy.  Based on federal funds futures, the probability of a first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the September meet-ing fell slightly; the probabilities attached to subsequent meetings through January 2016 were generally little changed and rose for meetings later that year.  Similarly, results from the Desk's September Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants indicated that, on average, respondents pushed out their expected timing of the first increase in the target range for the fed-eral funds rate.  Regarding the most likely meeting date for the first rate increase, survey respondents were about evenly split between September and December.  Data on overnight index swap rates indicated that investors marked down the expected path of the federal funds rate, on balance, over the intermeeting period. Despite the decline in global equity markets and the downward shift in the expected path of the federal funds rate, yields on nominal Treasury securities moved up modestly, with some market participants citing pur-ported sales of Treasury securities by foreign govern-ment authorities to finance foreign exchange market in-tervention as a factor that likely put upward pressure on Treasury yields.  Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities fell to near their historical lows. Broad U.S. equity price indexes were highly correlated with foreign equity indexes over the intermeeting period and posted net declines.  Although concerns about global economic growth likely contributed to the de-clines in domestic equity prices, investors may also have reassessed valuations and risk in equity markets.  Do-mestic equity indexes were quite volatile in late August and early September, and one-month-ahead option- implied volatility on the S&P 500 index reached levels last seen in 2011.  Spreads on 10-year triple-B-rated and speculative-grade corporate bonds over comparable- maturity Treasury securities widened slightly over the in-termeeting period. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses tight-ened modestly over the summer.  Corporate bond and institutional leveraged loan issuance remained solid through July but moderated in August.  The growth of commercial and industrial loans on banks' books slowed in July and August; the deceleration was concentrated in  banks with greater exposures to oil and gas firms.  Fi-nancing for commercial real estate (CRE) remained broadly available, with CRE loans on banks' books ex-panding and issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) staying robust.  However, spreads on investment-grade CMBS widened noticeably in August, reportedly a result of heavy issuance as well as the in-creased volatility in broader financial markets. Conditions in the market for residential mortgages con-tinued to improve slowly, with interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages declining slightly.  Bank holdings of closed-end residential loans increased modestly, and the Mortgage Bankers Association's index of mortgage credit availability edged up further.  However, credit availability for borrowers with low credit scores, hard-to-document income, or high debt-to-income ratios re-mained tight. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re-mained generally accommodative, and the performance of outstanding consumer loans was largely stable.  Credit card balances expanded amid gradually easing lending standards, and student and auto loans continued to be broadly available, even to borrowers with subprime credit scores.  Delinquency rates on credit card loans and auto loans stayed low through the second quarter, while delinquency rates on student loans remained elevated. The exchange value of the U.S. dollar rose notably over the period against the currencies of most major U.S. trading partners.  While the dollar depreciated against the euro and the yen, it appreciated against the Canadian dollar.  The dollar also strongly appreciated against the currencies of most emerging market economies, as most Asian currencies weakened against the dollar following a depreciation of the Chinese renminbi, and as the curren-cies of commodity exporters fell along with declining commodity prices.  Sovereign yields in the advanced for-eign economies ended the period roughly unchanged.  Changes in peripheral euro-area sovereign yield spreads were mixed, with Greek sovereign spreads narrowing significantly over the period as Greece and the euro area finalized Greece's third bailout package.  In contrast, falling commodity prices and concerns about the pace of global growth contributed to capital outflows and gen-erally wider spreads on dollar-denominated debt in emerging Asia and Latin America. Staff Economic Outlook The U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was a little weaker, on bal-ance, than the one prepared for the July FOMC meeting.  Recent information on real U.S. economic activity was generally stronger than expected, but equity prices de-clined, the foreign exchange value of the dollar appreci-ated further, and indicators of foreign economic growth were generally weak.  The staff left its forecast for real GDP growth over the second half of the year little changed but lowered its projection for economic growth over the next several years.  The staff also further trimmed its assumptions for the rates of increase in productivity and potential output over the medium term.  On net, the level of GDP was anticipated to rise above its potential next year, and that gap was projected to widen gradually over the medium term.  The unemploy-ment rate was projected to run a little below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period. The staff projected that consumer price inflation would move down over the near term by more than in the pre-vious projection.  Crude oil prices declined further over the intermeeting period and were expected to result in lower consumer energy prices, and the effects of recent dollar appreciation and lower commodity prices were anticipated to push down non-oil import prices.  With energy prices and non-oil import prices expected to begin to increase steadily next year, the staff projected that inflation would rise gradually over the next several years but would still be slightly below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent at the end of 2018.  In-flation was anticipated to move up to 2 percent thereaf-ter, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the Committee's objective and slack in labor and product markets projected to have waned. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its September projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The risks to the forecast for real GDP and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy with-stand substantial adverse shocks.  Consistent with this downside risk to aggregate demand and with the further adjustments to the staff's supply-side assumptions, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemploy-ment rate as tilted to the upside. Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, in-flation, and the federal funds rate for each year from  2015 through 2018 and over the longer run, conditional on each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy.  The longer-run projections represent each par-ticipant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes. In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information re-ceived over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity was expanding moderately.  Although net exports remained soft, household spending and busi-ness fixed investment were increasing moderately, and the housing sector recovered further.  The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment, and labor market indicators showed that underutilization of labor resources had diminished since early in the year. Growth in real GDP over the first half of the year was stronger than participants expected when they prepared their June forecasts, and the unemployment rate de-clined somewhat more than anticipated.  Participants made only small adjustments to their projections for economic activity over the medium term.  They contin-ued to anticipate that, with appropriate policy accommo-dation, the pace of expansion of real activity would re-main somewhat above its longer-run rate over the next two years and lead to further improvement in labor mar-ket conditions.  Most continued to see the risks to real activity and unemployment as nearly balanced, but many acknowledged that recent global economic and financial developments may have increased the downside risks to economic activity somewhat. Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower; survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.  Participants anticipated that recent global developments would likely put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term; compared with their previous forecasts, more now saw the risks to in-flation as tilted to the downside.  But participants still expected that, as the labor market continued to improve and the transitory effects of declines in energy and non-oil import prices dissipated, inflation would rise gradu-ally toward 2 percent over the medium term. Consumer spending was rising at a solid rate after a modest increase in the first quarter.  Participants noted that ongoing gains in employment and real income were providing support for the rise in spending, and this sup-port was expected to continue going forward.  House-hold credit performance was also favorable, with delin-quency rates on credit cards and auto loans low.  The available reports from District contacts in the retail and auto industries confirmed the recent solid gains in con-sumer spending.  Contacts were generally optimistic about the outlook, although retail sales appeared to be softening in a few areas where economic activity was ad-versely affected by declines in the energy sector and the increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Housing activity was improving, with sales and new con-struction trending higher.  Solid gains in employment and favorable mortgage rates were anticipated to con-tinue to underpin the recovery in housing.  Contacts in a number of Districts were upbeat about prospects for the sector, citing strengthening sales, rising home prices, an upturn in household formations, and reports that buyers had accelerated purchases in anticipation of the possibility that mortgage rates might move higher in the near term.  Multifamily construction was particularly strong in a couple of Districts, but in another a shortage of lots was constraining builders' ability to meet strong demand for new single-family homes. The information on business spending from District contacts was mixed.  Nonresidential construction was reported to be expanding in a number of regions.  In manufacturing, the auto industry remained a bright spot, but the appreciation of the dollar was still restraining production of goods for export.  Optimism remained relatively high according to some District contacts, al-though a few regional activity surveys noted some cau-tion related to uncertainty about recent economic devel-opments abroad.  The weakness in commodity prices and the appreciation of the dollar also continued to weigh on activity in the energy and agricultural sectors.  Moreover, the outlook for the energy sector appeared to be worsening.  The substantial global supply of crude oil seemed likely to maintain downward pressure on energy prices for some time, leading to a deterioration in credit conditions for some U.S. producers and a further reduc-tion in their capital outlays. Participants agreed that labor market conditions had im-proved considerably since earlier in the year.  Payroll em-ployment had been increasing steadily.  Underutilization of labor resources had diminished along a number of di-mensions:  The unemployment rate had fallen to a level  close to most participants' estimates of its longer-run normal rate, and the numbers of discouraged workers and those employed part time for economic reasons had moved lower.  With the cumulative improvement in la-bor market conditions, most participants thought that the underutilization of labor resources had been sub-stantially reduced, and a few of them expressed the view that underutilization had been eliminated.  But some others believed that labor market slack in addition to that measured by the unemployment rate remained and that further progress was possible before labor market con-ditions were fully consistent with the Committee's ob-jective of maximum employment.  They pointed out that, even recognizing the downward trend in labor force participation, the level of the participation rate, particu-larly for prime-age adults, remained depressed; similarly, the number of workers on part-time schedules for eco-nomic reasons was still elevated.  A number of partici-pants noted that eliminating slack along such broader di-mensions might require a temporary decline in the un-employment rate below its longer-run normal level, and that this development could speed the return of inflation to 2 percent. The incoming information on wages and labor compen-sation, including an especially low reading on the em-ployment cost index for the second quarter, showed no broad-based acceleration.  To some, the continued sub-dued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of up-ward pressure on inflation from current levels of labor utilization.  Several others, however, noted that weak productivity growth and low price inflation might be contributing to modest wage increases.  A number of participants reported that some of their business con-tacts were experiencing labor shortages in various occu-pations and geographic areas resulting in upward pres-sure on wages, with a few indicating that the pickup in wages had become more widespread. Recent readings on headline consumer price inflation re-flected only small increases in core inflation and renewed weakness in consumer energy prices.  As a result, the 12-month changes in both the total and core PCE price indexes for August were expected to still be well below the Committee's 2 percent objective.  Participants con-tinued to judge that a significant portion of the shortfall was the result of the transitory effects of declines in prices of oil and non-energy commodities.  A few par-ticipants pointed out that since January when the steep drop in energy prices ended, core PCE prices had risen at an annual rate of 1.7 percent, closer to the Commit-tee's objective, despite the continued decline in prices of non-energy imports.  Still, almost all participants antici-pated that inflation would continue to run below 2 per-cent in the near term, particularly in light of the further decline in oil prices and further appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting period.  Participants also discussed various measures of expectations for inflation over the longer run.  Surveys continued to show stable longer-run inflation expectations, and most participants continued to anticipate that longer-run inflation expectations would remain well anchored.  A few participants ex-pressed some concern about the decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation.  However, it was noted that the decline seemed to be related to the further drop in oil prices or may importantly reflect shifts in risk and liquidity premiums, and thus may not signal addi-tional broad and persistent downward price pressures. Participants discussed the potential implications of re-cent economic and financial developments abroad for U.S. economic activity and inflation.  A material slow-down in economic growth in China and potential ad-verse spillovers to other economies were likely to de-press U.S. net exports to some extent.  In addition, con-cerns associated with developments in China and other emerging market economies had contributed to a further appreciation of the dollar and declines in prices of oil and other commodities, which were likely to hold down U.S. consumer price inflation in the near term.  In the United States, equity prices fell, on balance, amid signif-icant volatility, and risk spreads for businesses widened.  Many participants judged that the effects of these devel-opments on domestic economic activity were likely to be small, but they acknowledged the risk that they might restrain U.S. economic growth somewhat.  In particular, the appreciation of the dollar since mid-2014 was still a substantial drag on net exports, and the further rise in the dollar over the intermeeting period could augment the restraint on U.S. net exports.  Some participants commented that the recent decline in equity prices needed to be viewed in the context of overall valuation levels, which they saw as relatively high, and a couple noted that volatility had begun to subside. During their discussion of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants indicated that they did not see the changes in asset prices during the intermeeting period as bearing significantly on their policy choice ex-cept insofar as they affected the outlook for achieving the Committee's macroeconomic objectives and the risks associated with that outlook.  Many of them saw the likely effects of recent developments on the path of economic activity and inflation as small or transitory.  Most participants continued to anticipate that, based on  their assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, the conditions for policy firming had been met or would likely be met by the end of the year.  How-ever, some participants judged that the downside risks to the outlook for economic growth and inflation had in-creased.  In their view, although the time for policy nor-malization might be near, it would be appropriate to wait for information, including evidence of further improve-ment in the labor market, confirming that the outlook for economic growth had not deteriorated significantly and that inflation was still on a path to return to 2 per-cent over the medium term.  A few mentioned that a pickup in wage increases could bolster their confidence that resource utilization had tightened sufficiently to help move inflation toward the Committee's objective, but they did not view an acceleration in wages as a nec-essary condition for gaining such confidence. Participants weighed a number of risks associated with the timing of policy firming.  Some participants were concerned that the downside risks to inflation could be realized if the target range for the federal funds rate was increased before it was clear that economic growth would remain at an above-trend pace and downward pressures on inflation had abated.  They also worried that such a premature tightening might erode the credi-bility of the Committee's inflation objective if inflation stayed at a rate below 2 percent for a prolonged period.  It was noted that monetary policy was better positioned to respond effectively to unanticipated upside inflation surprises than to persistent below-objective inflation, particularly when the federal funds rate was still near its effective lower bound.  Such considerations also argued for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate gradually after policy normalization was under way.  Some other participants, however, expressed concerns about delaying the start of normalizing the target range for the federal funds rate much longer.  For example, a significant delay risked an undesired buildup of inflation-ary pressures or economic and financial imbalances that would be costly to unwind and that eventually could have adverse consequences for economic growth.  In ad-dition, a prompt decision to firm policy could provide a signal of confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy that might spur rather than restrain economic activity.  These participants preferred to begin policy firming soon, with most of them expecting that beginning the process before long would allow the target range for the federal funds rate to be increased gradually. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in July indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace.  Although net ex-ports remained soft, economic growth was broadly based.  Members noted that recent global and financial market developments might restrain economic activity somewhat as a result of the higher level of the dollar and possible effects of slower economic growth in China and in a number of emerging market and commodity- producing economies.  Nevertheless, they still viewed the risks to U.S. economic activity as nearly balanced, and they continued to expect that, with appropriate pol-icy accommodation, economic activity would most likely continue to expand at a moderate pace. Members agreed that labor market conditions had im-proved considerably since earlier in the year, with ongo-ing solid gains in payroll employment and the unemploy-ment rate falling to a level quite close to their estimates of its longer-run normal rate.  Members anticipated that economic activity was likely to continue to expand at a pace sufficient to lead to a further reduction in underuti-lization of labor resources.  Headline inflation continued to be held down by the effects of declines in energy and commodity prices, and the year-over-year increase in core PCE inflation remained below the Committee's ob-jective.  Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable; market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower.  Members anticipated that the declines in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting pe-riod were likely to exert some additional downward pres-sure on inflation in the near term.  Members expected inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the me-dium term as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipated, but they agreed to continue to monitor infla-tion developments closely. In assessing whether economic conditions had im-proved sufficiently to initiate a firming in the stance of policy, many members said that the improvement in la-bor market conditions met or would soon meet one of the Committee's criteria for beginning policy normaliza-tion.  But some indicated that their confidence that in-flation would gradually return to the Committee's 2 per-cent objective over the medium term had not increased, in large part because recent global economic and finan-cial developments had imparted some restraint to the economic outlook and placed further downward pres-sure on inflation in the near term.  Most members agreed  that their confidence that inflation would move to the Committee's inflation objective would increase if, as ex-pected, economic activity continued to expand at a mod-erate rate and labor market conditions improved further.  Many expected those conditions to be met later this year, although several members were concerned about down-side risks to the outlook for real activity and inflation. Other factors important to the Committee's assessment of the inflation outlook were the expectation that the in-fluences of lower energy and commodity prices on head-line inflation would abate, as had occurred in previous episodes, and that inflation expectations would remain stable.  With energy and commodity prices expected to stabilize, members' projections of inflation incorporated a step-up in headline inflation next year.  However, sev-eral members saw a risk that the additional downward pressure on inflation from lower oil prices and a higher foreign exchange value of the dollar could persist and, as a result, delay or diminish the expected upturn in infla-tion.  And, while survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable, a couple of members ex-pressed unease with the decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation over the intermeet-ing period. After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the la-bor market, and inflation and weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, all but one member con-cluded that, although the U.S. economy had strength-ened and labor underutilization had diminished, eco-nomic conditions did not warrant an increase in the tar-get range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  They agreed that developments over the intermeeting period had not materially altered the Committee's economic outlook.  Nevertheless, in part because of the risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation, the Com-mittee decided that it was prudent to wait for additional information confirming that the economic outlook had not deteriorated and bolstering members' confidence that inflation would gradually move up toward 2 percent over the medium term.  One member, however, pre-ferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, indicating that the current low level of real interest rates was not appropriate in the context of current economic conditions. The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm in its postmeeting statement that the Committee's deci-sion about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assess-ment of actual and expected progress toward its objec-tives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  Members agreed that the Committee's evaluation of pro-gress on its objectives would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar-ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and in-flation expectations, and readings on financial and inter-national developments.  They also agreed to indicate that the Committee continued to anticipate that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it sees some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.  It was noted that the expected path of the federal funds rate, rather than the exact timing of the initial in-crease, was most important in influencing financial con-ditions and thus the outlook for the economy and infla-tion.  The Committee reiterated its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. The Committee also maintained its policy of reinvesting principal payments from its agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securi-ties at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial condi-tions. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage- backed securities.  The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.  The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:  Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.  Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing moderately, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft.  The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment.  On bal-ance, labor market indicators show that un-derutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objec-tive, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained sta-ble. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.  Nonetheless, the Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, eco-nomic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges con-sistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for eco-nomic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring developments abroad.  Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually to-ward 2 percent over the medium term as the la-bor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. To support continued progress toward maxi-mum employment and price stability, the Com-mittee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Commit-tee will assess progress-both realized and ex-pected-toward its objectives of maximum em-ployment and 2 percent inflation.  This assess-ment will take into account a wide range of in-formation, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Commit-tee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the la-bor market and is reasonably confident that in-flation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accom-modative financial conditions. When the Committee decides to begin to re-move policy accommodation, it will take a bal-anced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic con-ditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Com-mittee views as normal in the longer run.  Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. Dudley, Lael Brainard, Charles L. Evans, Stanley Fischer, Dennis P. Lockhart, Jerome H. Powell, Daniel K. Ta-rullo, and John C. Williams.  Voting against this action:  Jeffrey M. Lacker. Mr. Lacker dissented because he believed that maintain-ing exceptionally low real interest rates was not appro-priate for an economy with persistently strong consump-tion growth and tightening labor markets.  He viewed current disinflationary forces as likely to be transitory, and was reasonably confident that inflation would move toward 2 percent.  In his view, further delay in removing monetary policy accommodation would represent a risky departure from past patterns of FOMC behavior in re-sponse to such economic conditions. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on TuesdayŒWednesday, October 27Œ28, 2015.  The meeting adjourned at 10:55 a.m. on September 17, 2015. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on August 18, 2015, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on July 28Œ29, 2015.    _____________________________ Brian F. Madigan Secretary   Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-tee (FOMC) meeting held on September 1617, 2015, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unem-ployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 to 2018 and over the longer run.  available at the time of the meeting together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and as-sumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projections represent each iable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of fur-ther shocks to the economy.  participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her tives of maximum employment and stable prices. FOMC participants generally expected that, under ap-propriate monetary policy, economic growth in 2015 would be at or slightly above their individual estimates -run normal growth rate and would increase somewhat in 2016 before slowing to or toward its longer-run rate in 2017 and 2018 (table 1 and figure 1).  Most participants projected that the un-employment rate would decline a bit further over the re-mainder of 2015 and be at or slightly below their indi-vidual judgments of its longer-run normal level from 2016 through 2018.  Participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter change in the price in-dex for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would be very low this year but then would pick up no-tably next year and rise further in 2017; all participants projected that inflation would be at or close to the Com-mitt-run objective in 2018. As shown in figure 2, all but four participants anticipated that it would be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate in 2015.  Most expected that it would be appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate fairly gradually over the projection period as headwinds to economic growth fade, labor market indi-cators reach levels consistent with the Committeedated objective of maximum employment, and inflation moves up to 2 percent.  Most participants continued to expect that it would be appropriate for the federal funds rate still to be appreciably below its longer-run level in 2016 and 2017, reflecting the effects of remaining head-winds along with other factors. Most participants viewed the levels of uncertainty asso-ciated with their outlooks for economic growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years.  Most also judged the level of uncertainty about inflation to be broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years, although a few partic-ipants viewed it as higher.  In addition, most participants continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic growth and for the unemployment rate as broadly bal-anced, although some viewed the risks to economic growth as weighted to the downside and some saw the risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside.  A few more participants saw the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside than as balanced, while one judged these risks to be tilted to the upside. The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants generally projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate monetary pol-icy, real gross domestic product (GDP) would grow from 2015 through 2017 at a pace slightly above their estimates of its longer-run normal rate, and that real GDP growth would then slow in 2018 to a rate at or near their individual estimates of the longer-run rate.  Partic-ipants pointed to a number of factors that they expected would contribute to moderate real output growth over the next few years, including improving labor market conditions, strengthened household and business bal-ance sheets, the boost to consumer spending from low energy prices, diminishing restraint from fiscal policy, and still-accommodative monetary policy. Compared with their Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) contributions in June, all participants revised up their projections of real GDP growth for 2015, reflecting stronger-than-anticipated growth over the first half of the year.  Most participants revised down their projec-tions of real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017.  Several participants cited slower projected productivity growth as a reason for their downward revisions.  The median growth was 2.1 percent in 2015, 2.3 percent in 2016, 2.2 percent in 2017, and 2.0 percent in 2018.  Although about half of the participants marked down their projec-tions of real GDP growth in the longer run, the median remained at 2.0 percent. Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would decline a bit further over the remainder of 2015  Table1.EconomicprojectionsofFederalReserveBoardmembersandFederalReserveBankpresidents,undertheirindividualassessmentsofprojectedappropriatemonetarypolicy,September2015PercentVariableMedian1Centraltendency2Range32015201620172018Longerrun2015201620172018Longerrun2015201620172018LongerrunChangeinrealGDP2.12.32.22.02.02.0{2.32.2{2.62.0{2.41.8{2.21.8{2.21.9{2.52.1{2.81.9{2.61.6{2.41.8{2.7Juneprojection1.92.52.3n.a.2.01.8{2.02.4{2.72.1{2.5n.a.2.0{2.31.7{2.32.3{3.02.0{2.5n.a.1.8{2.5Unemploymentrate5.04.84.84.84.95.0{5.14.7{4.94.7{4.94.7{5.04.9{5.24.9{5.24.5{5.04.5{5.04.6{5.34.7{5.8Juneprojection5.35.15.0n.a.5.05.2{5.34.9{5.14.9{5.1n.a.5.0{5.25.0{5.34.6{5.24.8{5.5n.a.5.0{5.8PCEination0.41.71.92.02.00.3{0.51.5{1.81.8{2.02.02.00.3{1.01.5{2.41.7{2.21.8{2.12.0Juneprojection0.71.82.0n.a.2.00.6{0.81.6{1.91.9{2.0n.a.2.00.6{1.01.5{2.41.7{2.2n.a.2.0CorePCEination41.41.71.92.01.3{1.41.5{1.81.8{2.01.9{2.01.2{1.71.5{2.41.7{2.21.8{2.1Juneprojection1.31.82.0n.a.1.3{1.41.6{1.91.9{2.0n.a.1.2{1.61.5{2.41.7{2.2n.a.Memo:ProjectedappropriatepolicypathFederalfundsrate0.41.42.63.43.50.1{0.61.1{2.12.1{3.43.0{3.63.3{3.8-0.1{0.9-0.1{2.91.0{3.92.9{3.93.0{4.0Juneprojection0.61.62.9n.a.3.80.4{0.91.4{2.42.4{3.8n.a.3.5{3.80.1{0.90.4{2.92.0{3.9n.a.3.3{4.3Note:Projectionsofchangeinrealgrossdomesticproduct(GDP)andprojectionsforbothmeasuresofinationarepercentchangesfromthefourthquarterofthepreviousyeartothefourthquarteroftheyearindicated.PCEinationandcorePCEinationarethepercentageratesofchangein,respectively,thepriceindexforpersonalconsumptionexpenditures(PCE)andthepriceindexforPCEexcludingfoodandenergy.Projectionsfortheunemploymentratearefortheaveragecivilianunemploymentrateinthefourthquarteroftheyearindicated.Eachparticipant'sprojectionsarebasedonhisorherassessmentofappropriatemonetarypolicy.Longer-runprojectionsrepresenteachparticipant'sassessmentoftheratetowhicheachvariablewouldbeexpectedtoconvergeunderappropriatemonetarypolicyandintheabsenceoffurthershockstotheeconomy.Theprojectionsforthefederalfundsratearethevalue(roundedtothenearest1/8percentagepoint)ofthemidpointoftheprojectedappropriatetargetrangeforthefederalfundsrateortheprojectedappropriatetargetlevelforthefederalfundsrateattheendofthespeciedcalendaryearoroverthelongerrun.TheJuneprojectionsweremadeinconjunctionwiththemeetingoftheFederalOpenMarketCommitteeonJune16{17,2015.1.Foreachperiod,themedianisthemiddleprojectionwhentheprojectionsarearrangedfromlowesttohighest.Whenthenumberofprojectionsiseven,themedianistheaverageofthetwomiddleprojections.2.Thecentraltendencyexcludesthethreehighestandthreelowestprojectionsforeachvariableineachyear.3.Therangeforavariableinagivenyearincludesallparticipants'projections,fromlowesttohighest,forthatvariableinthatyear.4.Longer-runprojectionsforcorePCEinationarenotcollected.

The rate in the fourth quarter of each year was 5.0 percent in 2015 and 4.8 percent from 2016 through 2018.  Com-pared with the June for the unemployment rate generally shifted down some-what through 2017.  Many participants noted that recent data pointing to faster-than-expected improvement in la-bor market conditions were an important factor under-lying the downward revisions to their unemployment rate forecasts.  All but a few participants revised down their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unem-ployment; as a result, the median estimate edged down to 4.9 percent.  Several participants noted that still-sub-dued wage and price inflation despite the stronger-than-expected momentum in the labor market suggested a lower level of the longer-run normal rate of unemploy-ment than they had thought previously.  A few also men-tioned research indicating that demographic groups with lower average unemployment rates have accounted for an increasing fraction of the labor force. Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distribution of partici-P growth and the unemployment rate through 2018 and in the longer run.  The diversity of views across participants reflected, in part, their individual assessments of a num-ber of factors, including the effects of lower oil prices on consumer spending and business investment, the extent to which dollar appreciation and weaker foreign eco-nomic growth would affect real activity, the rate at which the forces that have been restraining the pace of the eco-nomic expansion would continue to abate, the degree to which ongoing improvements in the labor market would support stronger consumption growth, and the appro-priate path of monetary policy.  Relative to the June SEP, growth was roughly unchanged through 2016 but was somewhat wider in 2017 and the longer run.  The dis-ment rate in the longer run also widened somewhat. The Outlook for Inflation Compared with the June SEP, almost all participants marked down their projections for PCE inflation this year, noting that inflation had been running below their earlier projections and that further declines in energy prices and import prices were putting additional tempo-rary downward pressure on PCE inflation.  Nearly all participants saw PCE inflation picking up in 2016 and rising further in 2017, and almost all saw inflation at or t longer-run objective in 2018.  Some participants also marked down their pro-jections for core PCE inflation from 2015 through 2017, although almost all still expected core inflation to rise gradually over the projection period and to reach a level at or near 2 percent in 2018.  The median values of pro-jections for PCE inflation were 0.4 percent in 2015, 1.7 percent in 2016, 1.9 percent in 2017, and 2.0 percent in 2018, and the median values for core PCE inflation were 1.4 percent in 2015, 1.7 percent in 2016, 1.9 percent in 2017, and 2.0 percent in 2018.  Factors cited by par-ticipants as likely to contribute to a rise of inflation to-ward 2 percent included stable longer-term inflation ex-pectations, tighter resource utilization, a pickup in wage growth, the waning effects of declines in energy prices and appreciation of the dollar, and still-accommodative monetary policy. Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-bout the outlook for infla-tion.  flation in 2015 widened slightly compared with June, re-of the effects of the declines in energy and import prices on the outlook for inflation.  The dispersion for PCE inflation for 2016 and 2017 was about unchanged.  Sim-ilarly, the ranges for core PCE inflation widened slightly in 2015 and were unchanged for 2016 and 2017.  The distributions for both inflation measures in 2017 and 2018 were notably more concentrated near the Commit--run objective than those for 2015 and 2016. Appropriate Monetary Policy Participants judged that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate over the pro-jection period as forces that have been restraining the expansion abate and as labor market indicators and in-flation move toward values the Committee judges con-sistent with the attainment of its mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  As shown in figure 2, all but four participants anticipated that it would be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate during 2015.  However, most pro-jected that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate would remain noticeably below their individual estimates of its longer-run normal level through 2017.  Most par-ticipants saw the appropriate level of the federal funds rate as close to its longer-run normal level by 2018. Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would be at or only slightly above their estimates of its longer-run normal level at the end of the year in which  Figure3.A.Distributionofparticipants'projectionsforthechangeinrealGDP,2015{18andoverthelongerrun2015Number of participants246810121416181.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 1.7 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 2.7 2.9 3.1 Percent rangeSeptember projectionsJune projections2016Number of participants246810121416181.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 1.7 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 2.7 2.9 3.1 Percent range2017Number of participants246810121416181.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 1.7 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 2.7 2.9 3.1 Percent range2018Number of participants246810121416181.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 1.7 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 2.7 2.9 3.1 Percent rangeLonger runNumber of participants246810121416181.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 1.7 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 2.7 2.9 3.1 Percent rangeNote:nitionsofvariablesareinthegeneralnotetotable1.

Relative to June, the median value of the federal funds rate decreased 25 basis points at the end of 2015, 2016, and 2017 to 0.38 percent, 1.38 percent, and 2.63 percent, respec-tively, and the dispersion of the projections for the fed-eral funds rate widened from 2015 through 2017. Almost all participants judged that it would be appropri-ate for the federal funds rate to remain noticeably below its longer-run normal level over the next two years even though the unemployment rate was anticipated to be near its mandate-consistent level and most participants expected inflation to be close to 2 percent by 2017.  The reasons cited for only gradually increasing the federal funds rate included an assessment that the headwinds that have been holding back the economic expansion will continue to exert some restraint on economic activ-ity, partly because weak activity abroad and the recent appreciation of the dollar are likely to continue to damp U.S. net exports for some time.  As support for a view that accommodative monetary policy would remain ap-propriate over the next few years, some participants also noted their assessment that residual slack in the labor market will still be evident in measures of labor utiliza-tion other than the unemployment rate, or that the risks to the economic outlook are asymmetric as a result of the constraints on monetary policy associated with the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate.  Most participants expected the federal funds rate to be at or only slightly below its longer-run normal level by 2018. Relative to the June SEP, more than half of the partici-pants revised down their estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate, with a lower assessment                                                  1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total con-sumer price inflation over the period from 1995 through 2014.  sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to jections.  -run growth potential generally cited as a contributing factor.

Some participants also mentioned the prescriptions of various monetary policy rules as factors they considered in judging the appropri-ate path for the federal funds rate. Uncertainty and Risks Nearly all participants continued to judge the levels of uncertainty attending their projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norms during the previous 20 years (figure 4).1  Most participants continued to see the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as broadly balanced, although a larger number than in June viewed the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside.

Most participants judged the risks to the outlook for the un-employment rate to be broadly balanced, though more participants than in June viewed the risks to the unem-ployment rate as weighted to the upside. As in the June SEP, participants generally agreed that the levels of uncertainty associated with their inflation fore-casts were broadly similar to historical norms.  Many par-ticipants viewed the risks to their inflation forecast as balanced.  However, the risks were seen as tilted to the downside by more than half of the participants, an in-crease since the June SEP.  These participants cited the recent declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation and commodity prices and the apprecia-tion of the dollar as factors that could place greater downward pressure on prices than anticipated.

Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts.  Projection is percent change, fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.          Forecast Uncertainty    The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policy-makers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.  Considerable uncer-tainty attends these projections, however.  The economic and statistical models and relation-ships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen develop-ments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely eco-nomic outcome as embodied in their projec-tions, but also the range of alternative possibil-ities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they oc-cur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Federal Open Market Committee.  The projec-tion error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-tending those projections is similar to that ex-perienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would ex-pand within a range of 1.7 to 4.3 percent in the current year,  1.1 to 4.9 percent  in  the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year.  The corre-sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the fourth year. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast un-certainty in the past, as shown in table 2.  Partic-ipants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the up-side, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, participants judge whether each variable is more likely to be above or below their projections of the most likely out-come.  These judgments about the uncertainty and the risks attentions are distinct from the diversity of partici-Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks associated with a particular projection rather than with divergences across a number of differ-ent projections. As with real activity and inflation, the out-look for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This un-certainty arises primarily because each partici-pants assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward.
