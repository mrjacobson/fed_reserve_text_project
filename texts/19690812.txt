With Messrs. Maisel and Mitchell dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that expansion in real economic activity slowed somewhat in the first half of 1969 and some further moderation is projected. Substantial upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. 8/12/69Most market interest rates recently have receded slightly from their earlier highs. In July the money supply expanded as U. S. Government deposits decreased further; bank credit declined on average, after adjusting for an increase in assets sold to affiliates and to customers with bank guarantees.  The run-off of large-denomination CD's which began in mid-December continued without abatement in July, and there apparently were net outflows from consumer-type time and savings accounts at banks and nonbank thrift institutions combined. The over-all balance of payments deficit on the liquidity basis remained very large in July; the balance on the official settlements basis was still in surplus in the first half of the month but subsequently shifted toward deficit as U. S. banks' borrowings of Euro-dollars leveled off. Foreign exchange markets appear initially to be adjusting in an orderly fashion to the announced devaluation of the French franc. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging sustainable economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections or if pressures arise in connection with foreign exchange developments or with bank regulatory changes.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, September 9, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting was adjourned.  Secretary
