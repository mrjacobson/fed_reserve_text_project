With Messrs. Bucher, Francis, Morris, and Sheehan dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is declining in the current quarter, mainly because of the oil situation, and that prices are continuing to rise rapidly. In January industrial production declined again, nonfarm payroll employment dropped, and the unemployment rate rose above 5 per cent. Prices of 2/20/74both farm products and industrial commodities increased very sharply. Wage rates have continued to rise substantially in recent months, although not so sharply as prices.  After having appreciated for several months, the dollar has declined somewhat on the average against foreign currencies in recent weeks. U.S. controls on capital outflows were removed at the end of January, and several foreign countries have relaxed controls on capital inflows. The U.S. trade surplus rose sharply in December and in the fourth quarter as a whole.  The narrowly defined money stock, after increasing substantially in the last 2 months of 1973, declined in January; most recently, however, it has appeared to strengthen.  Broader measures of the money stock continued to rise in January, as net inflows of consumer-type time deposits remained relatively strong. Expansion in business loans and in total bank credit accelerated, and banks stepped up issuance of large-denomination CD's. Since mid-January, short-term market interest rates have fallen appreciably, and long-term rates have declined somewhat.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, cushioning declines in production and employment that are being induced in large part by the oil situation, and maintaining equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of international and domestic financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  By unanimous vote, transfer to the National Archives of the FOMC minutes of actions and memoranda of discussion, on the basis described in a memorandum from the Secretariat dated January 14,1974, was authorized. 2/20/74It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on March 19, 1974, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
