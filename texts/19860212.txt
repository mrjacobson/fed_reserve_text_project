By unanimous vote, the Comittee voted for the following longer-run policy: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed to establish the following ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986. With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on the experience of recent years, the behavior of that aggregate was subject to substantial uncertainties in relationship to economic activity and prices, depending among other things on its responsiveness to changes in interest rates. It agreed that an appropriate target range under existing circumstances would be 3 to 8 percent, but it intends to evaluate movements in M1 in the light of its consistency with the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and potential inflationary pressures. It adopted a range of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1986.  With Mr. Martin and Ms. Seger dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is currently expanding at a moderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased substantially further in January, and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent.-3- 2/11-12/86In December industrial production rose further, and available information suggests some additional rise in January. Retail sales increased considerably in December after declining on balance over the previous two months, and housing starts rebounded from their October-November pace. Business capital spending strengthened somewhat in the fourth quarter.  Merchandise trade data for the fourth quarter suggest that the deficit widened further from the very high third-quarter level. In late 1985 consumer and producer prices rose somewhat more than earlier, but for the year as a whole broad measures of prices and wages increased at rates close to those recorded in 1984.  With respect to the Committee's ranges for longerterm monetary growth, M1 expanded at a rate well above the range set for the second half of 1985; M2 grew at a rate somewhat below the upper end of its range for the year; and M3 expanded at a rate near the midpoint of its range for 1985. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt was above the upper end of its monitoring range for the year. In January growth in M1 and M2 slowed markedly, while growth in M3 picked up as banks issued a substantial volume of large time deposits to support further robust growth in bank credit. Interest rates have fluctuated considerably since the December meeting of the Committee; on balance, short-term interest rates have risen a little while longer-term rates are unchanged to somewhat lower.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined further.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed to establish the following ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986. With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on the experience of recent years, the behavior of that aggregate was subject to substantial uncertainties in relationship to economic activity and prices, depending among other things on its responsiveness to changes in interest rates. It agreed that an appropriate target range under existing 2/11-12/86circumstances would be 3 to 8 percent, but it intends to evaluate movements in M1 in the light of its consistency with the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and potential inflationary pressures. It adopted a range of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1986.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from November to March at annual rates of about 6 percent and 7 percent, respectively; while the behavior of M1 continues to be subject to unusual uncertainty, growth at an annual rate of about 7 percent over the period is anticipated. Somewhat greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on April 1, 1986.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
