Increases in employment were relatively substantial, however, and in June the unemployment rate dropped below 5 per cent.  Wage rates advanced at a faster pace during the second quarter than earlier in the year. In the months immediately preceding the price freeze imposed in mid-June, the rise in prices of both industrial commodities and farm and food products remained extraordinarily rapid.  The U.S. merchandise trade balance worsened in May as import prices rose sharply further, but the trade deficit remained well below the first-quarter average. In foreign exchange markets, the jointly floating continental European currencies rose sharply further against the dollar in early July. After the first week in July, the dollar recovered somewhat on the basis of market expectations of official intervention. On July 10 the Federal Reserve announced substantial increases in its swap arrangements with other central banks.  Both the narrowly and more broadly defined money stock rose sharply in May and June, although inflows of consumertype time and savings deposits slackened somewhat in the latter month. Expansion in bank credit continued at a substantial pace. Since mid-June both short- and long-term market interest rates have advanced considerably further, with the sharpest increases in the short-term sector. On June 29 increases were announced in Federal Reserve discount rates, from 6-1/2 to 7 per cent, and in member bank reserve requirements; on July 5 ceiling interest rates were increased on time and savings deposits at commercial banks and other thrift institutions. 7/17/73 -5In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to abatement of inflationary pressures, a more sustainable rate of advance in economic activity, and progress toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of international and domestic financial market developments and the forthcoming Treasury financing, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with slower growth in monetary aggregates over the months immediately ahead than occurred on average in the first half of the year.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, August 21, 1973, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
