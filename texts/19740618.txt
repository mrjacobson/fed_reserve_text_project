The over-all rate of price rise, while very large, is not quite so rapid as in the first quarter. In May industrial production increased somewhat for the second consecutive month, and nonfarm employment expanded substantially further.  The unemployment rate moved above 5 per cent, however, as the civilian labor force rose sharply. Wholesale prices of farm and food products declined substantially further, but increases among industrial commodities again were widespread and extraordinarily large. The advance in wage rates accelerated somewhat further.  In May the depreciation of the dollar against leading foreign currencies was arrested. U.S. international transactions were in approximate balance on the official settlements basis, as bank-reported net outflows of capital apparently abated. The foreign trade deficit narrowed in April, despite a further large rise in the cost of petroleum imports.  Growth in the narrowly defined money stock moderated in May, but apparently it accelerated in early June. Net inflows of consumer-type time deposits at banks slowed in May, and deposit experience at nonbank thrift institutions continued poor. Business credit demands remained large, although the expansion in short-term credit was below the extraordinary pace of April and was less concentrated at banks. In May banks increased their outstanding largedenomination CD's substantially further and continued to 6/18/74borrow in the Euro-dollar market; most recently, however, they have reduced their reliance on these sources of funds.  Market interest rates have fluctuated in a narrow range in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, supporting a resumption of real economic growth, and achieving equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing restrictive money market conditions, provided that the monetary aggregates appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges of tolerance.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on July 16, 1974, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
