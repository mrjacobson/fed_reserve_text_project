With Messrs. Hayes, Brimmer, and Coldwell dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real economic activity, which leveled off in the fourth quarter of 1969, may be weakening further in early 1970. Prices and costs, however, are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. Long-term market interest rates recently have fluctuated under the competing influences of heavy demands for funds and shifts in investor attitudes regarding the outlook for monetary policy. Bank credit declined in January but the money supply increased substantially on average; both had risen slightly in the fourth quarter. Flows of time and savings funds at banks and nonbank thrift 2/10/70institutions have remained generally weak since year end, and they apparently have been affected little thus far by the recent increases in maximum rates payable for such funds. The U.S. foreign trade balance improved somewhat in December, as imports fell off.  The over-all balance of payments has been in substantial deficit in recent weeks. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the orderly reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging sustainable economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the current Treasury refunding, possible bank regulatory changes and the Committee's desire to see moderate growth in money and bank credit over the months ahead, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to moving gradually toward somewhat less firm conditions in the money market; provided, however, that operations shall be modified promptly to resist any tendency for money and bank credit to deviate significantly from a moderate growth pattern.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, March 10, 1970, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
