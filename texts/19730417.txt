By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period March 20 through April 16, 1973, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. 4/17/73By unanimous vote, renewal for further periods of three months of the eight System swap drawings on the National Bank of Belgium maturing in the period May 2-23, 1973, was authorized.  By unanimous vote, renewal for further periods of three months of the two System swap drawings on the Swiss National Bank and the one drawing on the Bank for International Settlements maturing in the period May 9-16, 1973, was authorized.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests continued rapid growth in real output of goods and services in the first quarter, spurred by an extraordinary increase in consumption expenditures. Over the first 3 months of this year, employment rose strongly but the unemployment rate remained about 5 per cent. The recent advance in wage rates has been more moderate than in the latter part of 1972, but the increase in social security taxes in January added significantly to payroll costs.  The rate of increase in prices stepped up very sharply in the first quarter. Prices of foods have continued to rise at wholesale and retail, and in both February and March increases in wholesale prices of industrial commodities were large and widespread. Foreign exchange markets have been relatively quiet since mid-March, and there has been a moderate reflow into dollars. The U.S.  merchandise trade balance improved a little in JanuaryFebruary, when both exports and imports were sharply higher than in the fourth quarter of 1972.  Growth in both the narrowly and more broadly defined money stock slowed markedly in the first quarter following a bulge toward the close of last year. However, in the face of strong loan demand--especially from businesses-- 4/17/73banks sharply increased their issuance of largedenomination CD's, and the bank credit proxy expanded very rapidly. Short-term market interest rates continued to rise until the beginning of April, but since then some rates--particularly those on Treasury bills-have declined. Rates on long-term market securities have moved down on balance in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to abatement of inflationary pressures, a more sustainable rate of advance in economic activity, and progress toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of forthcoming Treasury financing, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 15, 1973, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
