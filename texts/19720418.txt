By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized, for a period up to one week from the date of this action, to employ the procedures for establishing rates on repurchase agreements that were in effect prior to the amendment on April 17, 1972, of paragraph 1(c) of the continuing authority directive with respect to domestic open market operations.  By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period March 21 through April 17, 1972, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. 4/18/72By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services grew in the first quarter at about the stepped-up rate attained in the fourth quarter of 1971. Most measures of business activity have shown strength recently and demands for labor have improved further, but the unemployment rate remains high. The rise in wholesale prices slowed in March as some farm and food products declined sharply, but the rise in prices of industrial commodities remained substantial. Wage rates also rose substantially in March and over the first quarter as a whole. The dollar has strengthened somewhat in exchange markets in recent weeks, and the over-all U.S.  balance of payments deficit on the official settlements basis has been small. In January and February merchandise imports continued to be considerably in excess of exports.  The narrowly defined money stock expanded rapidly in February and March, bringing the annual rate of growth over the past 6 months to about 5-1/4 per cent. Inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to banks have been strong thus far this year, although they moderated as the first quarter progressed; inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained very large. Mainly reflecting swings in U.S. Government deposits, a modest increase in the bank credit proxy in February was followed by a large increase in March. Market interest rates generally have continued to rise in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of capital market developments and the forthcoming Treasury financing, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support somewhat more moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead. 4/18/72 -5It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 23, 1972, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.
