By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that the very rapid increase in over-all economic activity is being accompanied by persisting inflationary pressures. Enactment of fiscal restraint measures now under consideration in Congress, however, would be expected to contribute to a considerable moderation of the rate of advance in aggregate demands. Growth in bank credit and time and savings deposits has been relatively small on average in recent months, although the money supply has expanded considerably as U.S.  Government deposits have declined. Both short- and long-term interest rates have receded from the advanced levels reached in May, mainly in reaction to enhanced expectations of fiscal restraint. The U.S. foreign trade balance and over-all payments position continue to be a matter of serious concern. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resistance of inflationary pressures and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments, while taking account of the potential impact of developments with respect to fiscal legislation.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining generally firm but orderly conditions in the money market; provided, however, that if the proposed fiscal legislation is enacted operations shall accommodate tendencies for short-term interest rates to decline in connection with such affirmative congressional action on the pending fiscal legislation so long as bank credit expansion does not exceed current projections. 6/18/68 -4It was agreed the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, July 16, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.
