By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period August 18 through September 14, 1970, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  With Mr. Hayes dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real economic activity, which edged up slightly in the second quarter, is expanding somewhat further in the third quarter, led by an upturn in residential construction. Wage rates generally are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, but improvements in productivity appear to be slowing the rise in costs, and some major price measures are rising less rapidly than before.  Interest rates declined in the last half of August, but most yields turned up in early September, as credit demands in securities markets have continued heavy; existing yield spreads continue to suggest concern with credit quality. The money supply rose rapidly in the first half of August but moved back down through early September. Bank credit expanded sharply further in August as banks continued to issue large-denomination CD's at a relatively rapid rate, while reducing their reliance on the commercial paper market after the Board of Governors acted to impose reserve requirements on bank funds obtained from that source. The balance of payments deficit on the liquidity basis diminished somewhat in July and August from the very large secondquarter rate, but the deficit on the official settlements basis remained high as banks repaid Euro-dollar liabilities. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, while encouraging the resumption of sustainable economic growth and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate growth in money and attendant bank credit expansion over the months ahead. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with that objective.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, October 20, 1970, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary9/15/70-4-
