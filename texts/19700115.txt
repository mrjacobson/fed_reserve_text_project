The memorandum of discussion for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 16, 1969, was accepted.1/15/70-2- 1/15/70 -3By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period December 16, 1969, through January 14, 1970, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period December 16, 1969, through January 14, 1970, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real economic activity leveled off in the fourth quarter of 1969 and that little change is in prospect for the early part of 1970. Prices and costs, however, are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. Most market interest rates have receded from highs reached during December. Bank credit and the money supply increased slightly on average in December and also over the fourth quarter as a whole. Outstanding large-denomination CD's held by domestic depositors have continued to contract in recent months while foreign official time deposits have expanded considerably. Flows of consumer-type time and savings funds at banks and nonbank thrift institutions have remained weak, and there apparently were sizable net outflows after year-end interest crediting. U.S.  imports and exports have both grown further in recent months but through November the trade balance showed little or no further improvement from the third-quarter level. At the year end the over-all balance of payments statistics were buoyed by large temporary inflows of U.S.  corporate funds. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the orderly 1/15/70reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging sustainable economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury refunding, possible bank regulatory changes and the Committee's desire to see a modest growth in money and bank credit, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining firm conditions in the money market; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if money and bank credit appear to be deviating significantly from current projections.  By unanimous vote, transfer to the National Archives of the minutes of the Committee for the years 1962-65, inclusive, on the basis described in a memorandum from the Secretariat dated January 8, 1970, was authorized.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, February 10, 1970, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
