With Messrs. Hayes, Hickman, Kimbrel, and Morris dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in over-all economic activity, while still strong, is moderating somewhat further from its very rapid pace earlier in the year. Upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Most market interest rates have risen further in recent weeks. Bank credit has continued to expand rapidly. Growth in the money supply has accelerated from the low average rate of recent months, while expansion in commercial bank time and savings deposits has slowed. Savings inflows to thrift institutions increased somewhat further in October but remained moderate. Following discussions among leading industrial countries, France, Germany, and Britain have acted to combat the recent speculation in their currencies by taking steps designed to reduce imbalances in their external payments. The U.S. foreign 11/26/68trade balance and over-all balance of payments improved in the third quarter but partial data for recent weeks suggest that the improvement is not being sustained, and the underlying U.S. payments position remains a serious problem. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable economic growth, continued resistance to inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the prevailing conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit expansion appears to be exceeding current projections.  It was agreed the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, December 17, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
