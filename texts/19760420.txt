Mr. Holland left the meeting prior to the following action.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services picked up in the first quarter. In March retail sales rose sharply further and recovery in industrial production continued. Gains in non-farm employment were again widespread and the unemployment rate declined from 7.6 to 7.5 per cent. Over the first quarter wholesale prices of farm products, foods, and fuels declined appreciably, but average wholesale prices of other commodities rose almost as rapidly as during the second half of 1975.  Over recent months, the advance in the index of average wage rates has moderated somewhat.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has been relatively steady in recent weeks, while the British pound and the Italian lira have remained under considerable downward pressure. In February the U.S. foreign trade balance registered a second successive monthly deficit; reported net outflows of private capital remained moderate.  Monetary aggregates expanded moderately in March.  At commercial banks, inflows of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's fell substantially from the exceptional pace of February; inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained strong. Since mid-March, both short- and long-term market interest rates have declined.-3- 4/20/76In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on May 18, 1976.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
