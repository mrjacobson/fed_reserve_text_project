By unanimous vote, new procedures for System subscriptions in Treasury cash refundings, as proposed in the Manager's memorandum of July 10, 1968, were approved. It was agreed that a letter concerning the new procedures should be sent to the Secretary of the Treasury.  Secretary's Note: On July 18, 1968, the following letter was sent to the Secretary of the Treasury over the Chairman's signature: I am enclosing a memorandum prepared by the Manager of the System Open Market Account regarding the handling of System subscriptions to Treasury refunding offerings in the light of recent innovations in Treasury debt management techniques.  These innovations--which involved combining an exchange offering of new securities with a cash offering--have a number of obvious advantages from the point of view of debt management and System operations.  There is, however, a disadvantage in that--for practical reasons--the System's options for exchanging its holdings of maturing issues are limited. As a result, the System's 7/16/68subscriptions tend to be predetermined by the Treasury's choice of a particular debt management technique--a situation that may not be the best for monetary management. This anomalous situation could be avoided if the suggestions contained in the memorandum were adopted by the Treasury and I commend them to you.  I emphasize that what is involved is a technical problem and not a question of basic relationships between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. I know that we both feel strongly that any Treasury offering must meet the test of the market and that the Treasury does not want to look to special System support of its financing operations. I am sure that we would agree also that it is essential for the Federal Reserve to have ample facilities for rolling over its holdings of maturing issues, including the possibility of subscribing to both long- and short-term issues in any optional Treasury refunding operation.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that over-all economic activity continued to expand rapidly in the second quarter, with inventory accumulation accelerating while the rise in capital outlays and in consumer spending slowed. The new fiscal restraint measures are expected to contribute to a considerable moderation of the rate of advance in aggregate demands.  Industrial prices have been increasing less rapidly than earlier but consumer prices have continued to rise substantially and wage pressures remain strong. Growth in bank credit and time and savings deposits has been moderate on average in recent months; growth in the money supply has been larger as U.S. Government deposits have been reduced. Conditions in money and capital markets have eased somewhat, mainly in response to the increase in fiscal restraint. Although there recently have been large inflows of foreign capital, the U.S. 7/16/68foreign trade balance and underlying payments position continue to be matters of serious concern. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable economic growth, continued resistance to inflationary pressures and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of forthcoming Treasury financing activity, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to accommodating the tendency toward somewhat less firm conditions in the money market that has developed since the preceding meeting of the Committee; provided, however, that operations shall be modified, to the extent permitted by Treasury financing, if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.  It was agreed the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, August 13, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary-6-
