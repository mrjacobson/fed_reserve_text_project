Mr. Winn left the meeting prior to the following action.  With Messrs. MacLaury and Robertson dissenting, and with Mr. Mayo voting as alternate for Mr. Winn, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a substantial increase in real output of goods and services in the current quarter, although well below the unusually large rise recorded in the second quarter.  In July and August, wages and prices advanced somewhat more rapidly on balance than in the immediately preceding months, while the unemployment rate remained substantial. Foreign exchange market conditions have remained quiet in recent weeks and the central bank reserves of most industrial countries have continued to change little. In July, the large excess of U.S.  merchandise imports over exports persisted.  In August on average, growth slowed in the narrowly and broadly defined money stock and in the bank credit proxy, but in recent weeks the money stock has been expanding more strongly.  Since mid-August, interest rates on Treasury bills have increased sharply, while yields on most other market securities have advanced more moderately.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments. 9/19/72To implement this policy, while taking special account of the effects of possible bank regulatory changes, developments in credit markets, and international developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support more moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, October 17, 1972, at 9:30 a.m.  Thereupon the meeting adjourned.Secretary
