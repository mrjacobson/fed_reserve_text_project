By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period December 14, 1988, through February 7, 1989, were ratified.  Secretary's Note: The following actions were taken at the Wednesday session.  With Mr. Hoskins dissenting, the following longer-run policy for 1989 was approved by the Committee: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting reaffirmed its decision of late June to lower the ranges for growth of M2 and M3 to 3 to 7 percent and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 6-1/2 to 101/2 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in their velocities, developments in the economy and financial markets, and progress toward price level stability.  With Messrs. Hoskins and Parry dissenting from the operational paragraph on policy implementation in the period immediately ahead, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that, apart from the direct effects of the drought, economic activity has continued to expand at a fairly vigorous pace. After strong gains in the fourth quarter, total nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply -4-in January, including a sizable increase in manufacturing. The civilian unemployment rate, at 5.4 percent in January, remained in the lower part of the range that has prevailed since the early spring of last year. Industrial production rose appreciably further in December and January. Housing starts declined somewhat in December but were up substantially on balance in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending advanced considerably in the fourth quarter, in part reflecting stronger sales of durable goods. Indicators of business capital spending suggest some weakening in recent months. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was slightly larger on average in October and November than in the third quarter. The latest information on prices suggests little change from recent trends, while wages have tended to accelerate.  The federal funds rate and Treasury bill rates have risen since the Committee meeting in mid-December; other short-term interest rates are generally unchanged to somewhat lower. Bond yields have declined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose substantially over the intermeeting period.  M2 and M3 weakened appreciably in January, especially M2. For the year 1988, M2 expanded at a rate a little below, and M3 at a rate around, the midpoint of the ranges established by the Committee. M1 has changed little on balance over the past several months; it grew about 4-1/4 percent in 1988. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have moderated somewhat in 1988 to a pace around the midpoint of the Committee's monitoring range for the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting reaffirmed its decision of late June to lower the ranges for growth of M2 and M3 to 3 to 7 percent and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in their velocities, developments in the economy and financial markets, and progress toward price level stability. -5In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from December through March at annual rates of about 2 and 3-1/2 percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 7 to 11 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday March 28, 1989.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
