By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting, including recent data for such measures of business activity as industrial production, employment, and retail sales, suggests that real output of goods and services is growing at a faster rate in the current quarter than in the two preceding quarters, but the unemployment rate remains high. In May wholesale prices of farm and food products advanced appreciably--after having changed little in April--and the rise in prices of industrial commodities remained substantial. The most recent data suggest some moderation in the pace of advance in wage rates. The U.S. balance of payments has been in surplus in recent weeks on both the official settlements basis and the net liquidity basis. In April, however, the excess of merchandise imports over exports was even larger than in February and March. Some strains have developed in international financial markets recently, involving European currencies.  Growth in the narrowly defined money stock slowed further in May, while growth in the broadly defined money stock stepped up somewhat as inflows of consumertype time and savings deposits to banks expanded considerably; over the April-May period, growth in both measures of the money stock was well below the high rates in the first quarter of the year. The outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's increased substantially further in May, and expansion in the bank credit proxy remained rapid. In recent weeks, market interest rates have continued to fluctuate in a narrow range. 6/20/72In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of possible Treasury financing and developments in capital markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, July 18, 1972, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
