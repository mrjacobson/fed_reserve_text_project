By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to executive transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that real output of goods and services expanded modestly in the third quarter, but greater growth appears in prospect for the current quarter. Although the unemployment rate has declined recently, it remains high. Available data indicate that the 90-day freeze effectively limited increases in price and wages, and basic policies for the post-freeze stabilization program have been announced. The narrowly defined money stock declined further in October, but inflows of consumertype time and savings deposits to banks expanded considerably and the broadly defined money stock increased moderately. Expansion in the bank credit proxy slowed substantially as the volume of large-denomination CD's outstanding rose less than in September and as U.S. Government deposits were reduced. Interest rates on both short- and long-term market securities have continued to decline in recent weeks and Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced by one-quarter of a percentage point to 4-3/4 per cent. The U.S. foreign trade balance was raised in September by a sharp acceleration of export shipments in advance of an East Coast port strike. In recent weeks net outflows of short-term capital apparently have diminished further, market exchange rates for foreign currencies against the dollar on average have not changed much, and foreign official reserve holdings have increased less than they did in September.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions consistent with the aims of the new governmental program, including sustainable real economic growth and 11/16/71increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote somewhat greater growth in monetary and credit aggregates over the months ahead. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to achieving bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with that objective.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, December 14, 1971, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
