By unanimous vote, renewal for further periods of 3 months of System drawings on the National Bank of Belgium, the Swiss National Bank, and the Bank for International Settlements, maturing in the period November 4 through 15, 1974, was authorized. 10/14-15/74 -4By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period September 10 through October 14, 1974, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  With Mr. Clay dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services declined somewhat further in the third quarter and that price and wage increases continued large. In September industrial production increased somewhat, reflecting settlement of work stoppages that had reduced output in August. An upsurge in the labor force, following several months of relatively slow growth, raised the unemployment rate from 5.4 to 5.8 per cent. The rise in wholesale prices of industrial commodities moderated, although it remained substantial, and prices of farm products and foods declined after having increased sharply in July and August.  On October 8 the President recommended a program to combat inflation and to mitigate the impact of monetary and fiscal restraint on certain sectors of the economy. The tax and expenditure proposals included in the program would, on balance, have approximately a neutral effect on the size of the Federal deficit.  In recent weeks the dollar has declined against leading foreign currencies. The U.S. foreign trade deficit increased substantially in August, as imports of petroleum and industrial materials rose while exports held steady. 10/14-15/74The narrowly defined money stock rose slightly in September and grew at an annual rate of about 2 per cent over the third quarter, compared with a rate of 6 per cent in the first half of the year. The money supply measure more broadly defined to include bank time and savings deposits other than money market CD's--as well as the measure that includes deposits at other thrift institutions--also rose only slightly in September. Over-all business credit demands slackened last month, and outstanding business loans at banks leveled off. Since early September interest rates on short-term market instruments have fallen considerably, while yields on Treasury and State and local government bonds have declined modestly.  Yields on corporate bonds have risen somewhat further, on balance, reflecting the large volume of offerings in prospect.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, supporting a resumption of real economic growth, and achieving equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing and of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with resumption of moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on November 19, 1974, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
