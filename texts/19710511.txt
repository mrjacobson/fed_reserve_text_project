It was agreed that a subcommittee consisting of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, or designated alternates, should be authorized to act on behalf of the Committee with respect to any response that might be made to central banks in the System's swap network raising questions similar to that raised recently by one such central bank concerning the appropriate interpretation of certain language in the swap contracts.  By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during th.  period April 6 through May 10, 1971, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services rose substantially in the first quarter primarily because of the resumption of higher automobile production, and more moderate growth appears to be in prospect for the current quarter. The unemployment rate remained high in 5/11/71April. Wage rates in most sectors are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. The rate of advance in consumer prices and in wholesale prices of industrial commodities moderated in the first quarter, but the rise in industrial prices stepped up again in April. The money stock both narrowly and broadly defined expanded substantially further in April but growth in bank credit slowed. Inflows of consumer-type time and savings funds to banks moderated, partly as a result of reductions in the interest rates offered by banks, but flows to nonbank thrift institutions continued heavy. Interest rates on most types of short- and long-term market securities rose sharply in April and early May, reflecting uncertainties about domestic, and more recently international, financial prospects. The over-all balance of payments deficit in the first four months of 1971 was exceptionally large, in great part reflecting short-term capital outflows. Recently, after further large international flows of funds, several European central banks suspended sales of their currencies for dollars; subsequently, announcements were made that the German mark and Dutch guilder would be permitted to float for the time being, and that the Swiss franc and Austrian schilling were being revalued. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the resumption of sustainable economic growth, while encouraging an orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, moderation of short-term capital outflows, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over the months ahead, taking account of the current Treasury financing, developments in capital markets, and uncertainties in foreign exchange markets. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be aimed initially at maintaining currently prevailing money market conditions, and thereafter conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with the above-cited objectives. 5/11/71 -5It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, June 8, 1971, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.
