Zeisel and Wendel entered the meeting after the foregoing item and left prior to the following item.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that output of goods and services--which had turned up in the second quarter--increased sharply further in the third quarter. In recent months retail sales have been maintained at the higher levels reached in early summer, and industrial production has strengthened progressively.  Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand in September, and the unemployment rate edged down from 8.4 to 8.3 per cent. In September, as in August, average wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose somewhat faster than earlier in the year, in part because of increases in prices of energy products; prices of farm and food products rose sharply in September. The advance in average wage rates in recent months has remained somewhat less rapid than in 1974 and early 1975.  After rising further in late September, the exchange value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has declined to about its mid-September level. In August the U.S. foreign trade surplus increased as agricultural exports rose. Bank-reported private capital movements showed a further net inflow, while U.S. liabilities to foreign official agencies declined again.  M1 rose slightly on the average in September but declined in the latter part of the month and in early October. From the second to the third quarter, however, M1 grew at a 6.9 per cent annual rate. Inflows of consumer type-time and savings deposits to banks and to 10/21/75nonbank thrift institutions continued to moderate in September, reflecting in part the attractiveness of alternative investments, and growth in M2 and M3 slowed further. Although conditions in markets for State and local government securities continued to be adversely affected by New York's financial problems, most shortand long-term interest rates have declined in recent weeks. On October 15 the Board of Governors announced a reduction of member bank reserve requirements on long-term time deposits.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on November 18, 1975.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
