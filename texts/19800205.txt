By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period January 9 through February 3, 1980, were ratified.  The following actions were taken on Tuesday, February 5, 1980.  By unanimous vote, the Committee adopted the following ranges for rates of growth in monetary aggregates for the period from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980: M-1A, 3½ to 6 percent; M-1B, 4 to 6½ percent; M-2, 6 to 9 percent; and M-3, 6½ to 9½ percent.  The associated range for bank credit is 6 to 9 percent.  With Messrs. Coldwell and Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services expanded somewhat in the final quarter of 1979 and that prices on the average continued to rise rapidly. In December retail sales strengthened, industrial production edged up, and nonfarm payroll employment continued to rise, while private housing starts remained at the reduced level of November. Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in January, but the unemployment rate rose from 5.9 to 6.2 percent. Producer prices of finished goods and consumer prices continued to rise rapidly toward the end of 1979, in part because of the spreading effects of earlier increases in energy costs. Over the past several months the rise in the index of average hourly earnings has remained close to the rapid pace recorded earlier in 1979. 2/4-5/80The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies changed little in January, and exchange market pressures were relatively slight in spite of increased international political tensions.  The U.S. foreign trade deficit rose in December, in large part because of an increase in imports of petroleum.  Growth of the major monetary aggregates, which had subsided in the final months of 1979, remained at reduced rates in January. Most market interest rates, especially long-term rates, have risen since the Committee's meeting in early January.  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3½ to 6, 4 to 6½, 6 to 9, and 6½ to 9½ percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth over the first quarter of 1980 at an annual rate of about 4 percent for M-1A and 5 percent for M-1B, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 11½ to 15 percent. The Committee believes that, consistent with this short-run policy, M-2 as newly defined should grow at an annual rate of about 6 percent over the first quarter.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, March 18, 1980, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary-4-
