By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period March 21 through April 17, 1978, wereratified.-2 - 4/18/78Renewal for further periods of 3 months of System drawings on the German Federal Bank and the Swiss National Bank maturing in the period May 2-22, 1978, was noted without objection.  Prior to the following action Mr. Gardner entered the meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee adopted the following ranges for rates of growth in monetary aggregates for the period from the first quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979: M-1, 4 to 6-1/2 per cent; M-2, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent; and M-3, 7-1/2 to 10 per cent. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 per cent.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period March 21 through April 17, 1978, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services was small in the first quarter, owing in part to the unusually severe weather and the lengthy strike in coal mining, but that economic activity was rebounding in the latter part of the period. In March industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply further. The unemployment rate edged up from 6.1 to 6.2 per cent, as the civilian labor force expanded substantially. Retail sales recovered much more in February than had been reported earlier, and sales rose considerably further in March.-3 - 4/18/78The pace of the rise in wholesale prices remained rapid, reflecting further large increases in farm products and processed foods. The index of average hourly earnings accelerated in the first quarter, largely because of the increase in minimum wages at the beginning of the year.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined sharply after the March 31 announcement of a very large increase in the U. S. foreign trade deficit for February. But over the past week the dollar has recovered to about its level of 4 weeks ago.  M-1, which had declined in February, rose moderately in March. Inflows to banks of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's and inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained slow. Most market interest rates, especially longer-term rates, have increased somewhat on balance in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  Growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively, from the first quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979 appears to be consistent with these objectives. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 per cent. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the April-May period to be within ranges of 4 to 8-1/2 per cent for M-1 and 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate slightly above the current level. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over-4 - 4/18/78 -5 the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 6-3/4 to 7-1/2 per cent.  In the conduct of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken of emerging financial market conditions, including the conditions in foreign exchange markets.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 16, 1978, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
