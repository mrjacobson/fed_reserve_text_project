D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding $8.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.  2.

All operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.  1. The Manager for Foreign Operations shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available): A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.  B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the System's net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with repayment of swap drawings.  C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change in the System's net position in that currency might be less than the limits specified in 1B.  D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.  2. The Manager for Foreign Operations shall clear with the Committee (or with the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available): A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee. 3/29-30/82B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.  3. The Manager for Foreign Operations shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System, and about any operations that are not of a routine character.  By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed the agreement of January 17, 1977, to "warehouse" foreign currencies for the Exchange Stabilization Fund and for the Treasury on the terms agreed upon by the Committee at its meeting on March 18, 1980, with the understanding that the agreement would be subject to annual review.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 1-2, 1982, were approved.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period February 2 through March 29, 1982, were ratified.  Secretary's note: All of the preceding actions were taken on Monday, March 29, 1982.  With Messrs. Black and Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP declined appreciably further in the first quarter of 1982 but that final purchases were sustained and the contraction in activity moderated during the quarter; prices on the average rose much less rapidly than in the preceding quarter. In January weakness in activity was accentuated by-13 - 3/29-30/82-14 -unusually severe weather, and in February the nominal value of retail sales rebounded while industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment recovered part of their January declines. The unemployment rate in February, at 8.8 percent, was unchanged from December. Although housing starts rose further in the first two months of the year, they remained at a depressed level. The rise in both the consumer price index and the producer price index for finished goods moderated substantially, and the advance in the index of average hourly earnings on the average remained at a reduced pace.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies continued to rise strongly in February and March; foreign monetary authorities intervened on a substantial scale to resist the depreciation of their currencies.  The U.S. foreign trade deficit in January and February on the average was somewhat less than the fourth-quarter rate.  M1 declined in February, after three months of rapid growth, and then increased moderately in early March. Growth of M2 slowed appreciably in February, owing to a slackening of the expansion in the nontransaction component as well as to the decline in M1.  Short-term market interest rates and bond yields on balance have declined since early February, and mortgage interest rates have edged down.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that its objectives would be furthered by growth of M1, M2, and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from March to June at annual rates of about 3 percent and 8 percent respectively.  The Committee also noted that deviations from these targets should be evaluated in light of the probability that M2 would be less affected over the period than M1 by deposit shifts related to the tax date and by changes in the relative importance of NOW accounts as a savings vehicle. Some shortfall in growth of M1, consistent 3/29-30/82-15 -with progress toward the upper part of the range for the year as a whole, would be acceptable in the context of appreciably reduced pressures in the money market and relative strength of other aggregates. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 12 to 16 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 18, 1982, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary's Note: On April 13-14, 1982, by unanimous vote, (with Mr. Roos voting as alternate for Mr. Ford), Committee members voted to increase from $3 billion to $5 billion the limit on changes between Committee meetings in System Account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities specified in paragraph 1(a) of the authorization for domestic open market operations, effective immediately, for the period ending with the close of business on May 18, 1982.  Secretary's Note: On April 26-27, 1982, by unanimous vote, (with Messrs. Roos and Guffey voting as alternates for Messrs. Ford and Balles, respectively, and Mr. Gramley absent), Committee members voted to approve an additional increase of $1 billion, to $6 billion, in the intermeeting limit on changes in holding of U.S. government and federal agency securities.Secretary
