With Messrs. Francis and Scanlon dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The economic and financial developments reviewed at this meeting indicate that, apart from the effects of the strike in the automobile industry, underlying economic conditions have strengthened and prospects favor more rapid growth later in the year. Upward pressures on costs persist, average prices of industrial commodities have risen further, and the rate of increase in consumer prices remains high.  While there recently have been large inflows of liquid funds from abroad through foreign branches of U.S. banks, the balance of payments continues to reflect a substantial underlying deficit. Bank credit expansion has continued large, although there was some moderation in September from the rapid July-August rate. The volume of corporate bond flotations has slackened, but Federal and State and local Government financing demands remain large and most interest rates have on balance moved up somewhat further. The President's new fiscal program is still pending before Congress. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market 10/3/67Committee to foster financial conditions, including bank credit growth, conducive to sustainable economic expansion, recognizing the need for reasonable price stability for both domestic and balance of payments purposes.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the prevailing conditions in the money market; but operations shall be modified, to the extent permitted by Treasury financing, to moderate any apparent tendency for bank credit to expand significantly more than currently expected.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, October 24, 1967, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
