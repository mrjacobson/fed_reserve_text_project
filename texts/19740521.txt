The memorandum of discussion for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on April 15-16, 1974, was accepted.  By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period April 6 through May 20, 1974, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period April 16 through May 20, 1974, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 5/21/74The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services--which had declined appreciably in the first quarter--is likely to change little in the current quarter and that price increases are continuing exceptionally large. In April industrial production and manufacturing employment expanded somewhat, after having declined for 4 months. The unemployment rate edged down to 5 per cent, as the civilian labor force declined. Wholesale prices of farm and food products declined substantially further, but increases among industrial commodities again were widespread and extraordinarily large. The advance in wage rates has accelerated somewhat in recent months, and unit labor costs have been rising at a fast pace.  In April and early May the dollar depreciated further against leading foreign currencies, and the balance of payments remained in deficit on the official settlements basis.  Rising import costs for petroleum and other products contributed to a sizable deficit in U.S. foreign trade in March.  Growth in the narrowly defined money stock slackened somewhat in April from the rapid pace in the preceding 2 months, and the more broadly defined money stock continued to expand moderately. Deposit experience at nonbank thrift institutions deteriorated sharply. Business short-term credit demands remained exceptionally strong. These demands were concentrated in banks, and to help finance loan growth, banks issued a record amount of large-denomination CD's and continued to borrow in the commercial paper and Euro-dollar markets. Private short-term market interest rates have risen sharply further in recent weeks and conditions in financial markets have been uneasy. Treasury bill rates also rose in late April and early May, but have declined markedly in recent days. Long-term rates have continued upward. Effective April 25, Federal Reserve discount rates were raised one-half point to 8 per cent.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, supporting a resumption of real economic growth, and achieving equilibrium in the country's balance of payments. 5/21/74To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing restrictive money market conditions, provided that the monetary aggregates appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges of tolerance.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, June 18, 1974, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
