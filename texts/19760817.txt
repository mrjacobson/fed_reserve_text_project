By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period July 20 through August 16, 1976, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services is remaining moderate in the current quarter. In July industrial production changed little, but total employment expanded by a substantial amount. The civilian labor force also increased sharply, and the unemployment rate rose from 7.5 to 7.8 per cent. Retail sales declined in July, following the rebound in June. The rise in the wholesale price index for all commodities remained moderate, as average prices of farm products and foods declined.  However, average prices of industrial commodities rose more than in other recent months. So far this year the advance in the index of average wage rates has been somewhat below the rapid rate of increase during 1975.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has remained relatively steady in recent weeks, despite some disturbances in exchange markets for European currencies. In June the U. S. foreign trade deficit increased, but the deficit for the second quarter as a whole was somewhat smaller than that for the first quarter. 8/17/76M1, which had declined slightly in June, expanded appreciably in July. Inflows of the time and savings deposits included in the broader aggregates were considerably stronger than in June, and growth in M2 and M3 was rapid. Market interest rates have declined somewhat further in recent weeks.  In light of.the foregoing devlopments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to maintain prevailing bank reserve and money market conditions over the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates currently expected.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on September 21, 1976, at 9:30 a.m.The meeting adjourned.
