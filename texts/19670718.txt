By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, 7/18/67to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The economic and financial developments reviewed at this meeting indicate that economic activity has been rising modestly and that prospects are for further expansion. Output is still being retarded by adjustments of excessive inventories, but growth in final demands continues strong, reflecting some strengthening in consumer expenditures for durable goods and housing, and also further increases in Government outlays. The overall indexes of both wholesale and retail prices have risen further, although wholesale prices of industrial commodities have remained stable. Bank credit expansion has been large in recent weeks. Most short- and long-term interest rates, after reaching advanced levels under the influence of heavy public and private securities market financing, have declined somewhat recently. The balance of payments deficit has remained substantial despite some improvement in the foreign trade surplus. In this situation, it is the Federal Open Market Committee's policy to foster money and credit conditions, including bank credit growth, conducive to continuing economic expansion, while recognizing the need for reasonable price stability for both domestic and balance of payments purposes.  To implement this policy, while taking account of forthcoming Treasury financing activity, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the prevailing conditions in the money market; but operations shall be modified insofar as the Treasury financing permits to moderate any apparent tendency for bank credit and money to expand more than currently expected.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, August 15, 1967, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
