Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.4/1/86-11 - 3. The Manager for Foreign Operations shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System, and about any operations that are not of a routine character.  By unanimous vote, responsibility for making determinations with respect to appeals of denial of access to Committee records under the provisions of 271.4(d) of the Committee's Rules Regarding Availability of Information was delegated to Mr. Rice, and in the absence of Mr. Rice, to Mr. Johnson.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 11-12, 1986, were approved.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period February 12 through March 31, 1986, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates a mixed pattern of developments with evidence of a pickup in economic activity from the reduced fourthquarter pace but with spending sluggish in some key sectors. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further in February following a large rise in January, but employment in manufacturing fell after four months of gains and industrial production declined.  The civilian unemployment rate rose sharply to 7.3 percent. Retail sales were little changed in January and February after rising over the previous two months, while housing starts were well above their pace in late 1985. Business capital spending apparently weakened somewhat in early 1986. The merchandise trade deficit for January appears to have been only slightly smaller than in December; preliminary data for February suggest that exports increased and that the price and quantity4/1/86-12 - -13 -of oil imports declined. Largely reflecting declines in energy prices, consumer prices edged down on balance over the first two months of 1986 and producer prices fell substantially.  Growth in M1 picked up considerably over the course of the first quarter, leaving this aggregate by March somewhat above the upper end of its range for the year.  On the other hand, growth of M2 was generally sluggish over the past 3 months and was running below its long-run range. Expansion of M3 was moderate during the winter months, with growth around the midpoint of its range for 1986. Interest rates have declined considerably since the February meeting of the Committee. On March 6, the Federal Reserve Board approved a reduction in the discount rate from 7-1/2 to 7 percent. The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies continued to decline through mid-March but has risen somewhat more recently; on balance the dollar has declined slightly since the February meeting.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at its February meeting to establish the following ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986. With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on the experience of recent years, the behavior of that aggregate was subject to substantial uncertainties in relationship to economic activity and prices, depending among other things on its responsiveness to changes in interest rates. It agreed that an appropriate target range under existing circumstances would be 3 to 8 percent, but it intends to evaluate movements in M1 in the light of its consistency with the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and potential inflationary pressures.  It adopted a range of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1986.4/1/86 4/1/86In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March to June at annual rates of about 7 percent; while the behavior of M1 continues to be subject to unusual uncertainty, growth at an annual rate of about 7 to 8 percent over the period is anticipated.  Somewhat lesser reserve restraint or somewhat greater reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 20, 1986.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary-14 -
