By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period July 11 through August 13, 1979, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, the amount of the reciprocal currency arrangement with the Bank of Mexico specified in paragraph 2 of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations was raised to $700 million, effective August 17, 1979.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period July 11 through August 13, 1979, were ratified.  With Messrs. Black and Rice dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is continuing to decline in the current quarter, while prices on the average are continuing to rise rapidly.  In July the dollar value of retail sales edged up; in real terms, sales were still substantially below those of last December. Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed considerably further, but the unemployment rate, at 5.7 percent, remained within the narrow range prevailing since the beginning of the year. Industrial production declined in June, and it apparently slackened further in July to-7 - 8/14/79about the level of last December. So far this year, broad measures of prices have increased at a much faster pace than during 1978, although producer prices of foods have declined since March. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings, which had slowed in May and June, picked up in July.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined somewhat further in the second half of July, and although it subsequently recovered, it remained below its level of early June. The U. S. trade deficit in the second quarter was larger than in the previous quarter, reflecting largely the significant rise in the price and value of oil imports.  Growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 remained rapid in July. Inflows of interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 were slightly stronger than in June. At nonbank thrift institutions, inflows of deposits declined somewhat. Short-term market interest rates have risen over recent weeks, while long-term rates have changed little on balance. An increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 9-1/2 to 10 percent was announced on July 20.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 11, 1979, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively, the same ranges that had been established in February. Having established the range for M-1 in February on the assumption that expansion of ATS and NOW accounts would-8 - 8/14/79dampen growth by about 3 percentage points over the year, the Committee also agreed that actual growth in M-1 might vary in relation to its range to the extent of any deviation from that estimate. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. The Committee anticipates that for the period from the fourth.  quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980, growth may be within the same ranges, depending upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate adjustments that may be required by legislation or judicial developments affecting interestbearing transactions accounts. These ranges will be reconsidered at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to developing conditions in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets.  Early in the period before the next regular meeting, System open market operations are to be directed at attaining a weekly average federal funds rate slightly above the current level.  Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds rate within the range of 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 percent. In deciding on the specific objective for the federal funds rate the Manager for Domestic Operations shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the August-September period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 4 to 8 percent for M-1 and 7 to 11 percent for M-2. If rates of growth of M-1 and M-2, given approximately equal weight, appear to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limits of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate is to be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be beyond the upper or lower limits of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager shall promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.-9 - 8/14/79-10 -By unanimous vote, paragraph 2 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to read as follows: The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or, under special circumstances, such as when the New York Reserve Bank is closed, any other Federal Reserve Bank) (a) to lend to the Treasury such amounts of securities held in the System Open Market Account as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the .Treasury, under such conditions as the Committee may specify; and (b) to purchase directly from the Treasury for renewable periods not to exceed thirty days, when authorized by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to an affirmative vote of not less than five members, for its own account (with discretion, in cases where it seems desirable, to issue participations to one or more Federal Reserve Banks) such amounts of special short-term certificates of indebtedness as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, provided that the rate charged on such certificates shall be a rate of 1/4 of 1 percent below the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of such purchases and provided that the total amount of such certificates held at any one time by the Federal Reserve Banks shall not exceed $2 billion.  By unanimous vote, the Committee approved the guidelines for lending securities from the System Open Market Account to the Treasury recommended by FOMC staff in a memorandum dated August 8, 1979, except that the Committee approved a charge for borrowed securities at a rate of 1/8 of 1 percent per annum. 8/14/79-11 -It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, September .18, 1979, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
