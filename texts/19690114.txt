The reports of audit of the System Open Market Account and of foreign currency transactions, made by the Board's Division of Federal Reserve Bank Operations as at the close of business on October 18, 1968, and submitted by Mr. Schaeffer, Chief Federal Reserve Examiner, were accepted.

With Mr. Morris dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that expansion in real economic activity has been moderating, with slower growth in consumer outlays but higher rates of business inventory accumulation and capital expenditures. Upward pressures on prices and costs, however, are persisting. Since the mid-December firming of monetary policy, most interest rates have risen further and, with the outstanding volume of large denomination CD's declining sharply, bank credit expansion has slowed. Growth in the money supply moderated somewhat on average in December from its rapid November pace. The U.S. foreign trade surplus remains very small but near the end of the year unusual capital inflows had a markedly favorable effect on the over-all balance of payments. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging a more sustainable rate of economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified, to the extent permitted by the forthcoming Treasury refunding, if bank credit expansion appears to be deviating significantly from current projections. 1/14/69 -4It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, February 4, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.
