By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period January 14 through February 3, 1969, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that expansion in real economic activity has been moderating, but that upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Prospects are for some further slowing in economic expansion in the period ahead.  Market interest rates recently have fluctuated near the highs reached around the turn of the year. Bank credit contracted slightly in January on average, as the outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's continued to decline sharply, inflows of other time and savings deposits slowed, and growth in the money supply moderated. The U.S. balance of payments on the liquidity basis appears to have reverted to deficit in early 1969, but large inflows of Euro-dollars have had the effect of keeping the official settlements balance in surplus. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging a more sustainable rate of economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the current Treasury refunding, System open market 2/4/69operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified, to the extent permitted by the Treasury refunding, if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on March 4, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
