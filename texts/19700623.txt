By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real economic activity is changing little in the current quarter after declining appreciably earlier in the year. Prices and costs generally are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, although some components of major price indexes recently have shown moderating tendencies.  Since late May market interest rates have shown mixed changes following earlier sharp advances, and prices of common stocks have recovered part of the large decline of preceding weeks. Attitudes in financial markets continue to be affected by uncertainties and conditions remain sensitive, particularly in light of the insolvency of a major railroad. In May bank credit changed little and the money supply rose moderately on average, following substantial increases in both measures in March and April. Inflows of consumer-type time and savings funds at banks and nonbank thrift institutions have been sizable in recent months, but the brief spring upturn in largedenomination CD's outstanding at banks has ceased. The over-all balance of payments was in heavy deficit in April and May. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, while encouraging the resumption of sustainable economic growth and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, in view of persisting market uncertainties and liquidity strains, open market 6/23/70operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall continue to be conducted with a view to moderating pressures on financial markets. To the extent compatible therewith, the bank reserves and money market conditions maintained shall be consistent with the Committee's longer-run objective of moderate growth in money and bank credit, taking account of the Board's regulatory action effective June 24 and some possible consequent shifting of credit flows from market to banking channels.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, July 21, 1970, at 9:30 a.m.  Thereupon the meeting adjourned.  Secretary
