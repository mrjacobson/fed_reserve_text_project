S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; provided that the aggregate amount of U. S. Government and Federal agency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments) at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not be increased or decreased by more than $8.0 billion during the period commencing with the opening of business on the day following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting; (b) When appropriate, to buy or sell in the open market, from or to acceptance dealers and foreign accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at market discount rates, prime bankers acceptances with maturities of up to nine months at the time of acceptance that (1) arise out of the current shipment of goods between countries or within the United States, or (2) arise out of the storage within the United States of goods under contract of sale or expected to move into the channels of trade within a reasonable time and that are secured throughout their life by a warehouse receipt or similar document conveying title to the underlying goods; provided that the aggregate amount of bankers acceptances held at any one time shall not exceed $100 million; (c) To buy U.

In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Banks to lend U. S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as the Committee may specify from time to time.  3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U. S.

By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations shown below was reaffirmed: AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS Reaffirmed February 6, 1990 1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent necessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time to time: A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U. S.  Treasury, with the U. S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with other international financial institutions: Austrian schillings Belgian francs Canadian dollars Danish kroner Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Japanese yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs B.

D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding $21.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.  2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements ("swap" arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity: -8-Amount of arrangement (millions of dollars Foreign bank equivalent) Austrian National Bank 250 National Bank of Belgium 1,000 Bank of Canada 2,000 National Bank of Denmark 250 Bank of England 3,000 Bank of France 2,000 German Federal Bank 6,000 Bank of Italy 3,000 Bank of Japan 5,000 Bank of Mexico Regular 700 Special 125 * Netherlands Bank 500 Bank of Norway 250 Bank of Sweden 300 Swiss National Bank 4,000 Bank for International Settlements: Dollars against Swiss francs 600 Dollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs 1,250 * Facility with maturity date of February 15, 1990.

All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1.A above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign currencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.  4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee. 5.

The.Manager for Foreign Operations shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System, and about any operations that are not of a routine character.  By unanimous vote, the Resolution of Federal Open Market Committee to provide for the continued operation of the Committee during an emergency and the Resolution of the Federal Open Market Committee authorizing certain actions by Federal Reserve Banks during an emergency were amended to read as follows: RESOLUTION OF FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE FOR THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE COMMITTEE DURING AN EMERGENCY Amended February 6, 1990 In the event of a national security emergency, if the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Federal Open Market Committee (or in the event of the unavailability of both of them, the Secretary or Acting Secretary of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) certifies that as a result of the emergency the available number of regular members and regular alternates of the Federal Open Market Committee is less than seven, all powers and functions of the said Committee shall be performed and exercised by, and authority to exercise such powers and functions is hereby delegated to, an Interim Committee, subject to the following terms and conditions: Such Interim Committee shall consist of: seven members, comprising each regular member and regular alternate of the Federal Open Market Committee then available, together with an additional number, sufficient to make a total of seven, which shall be made up in the following order or priority from those available: (1) each alternate at large (as defined below); (2) each President of a Federal Reserve Bank not then either a regular member or an alternate; (3) each First Vice President of a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that (a) within each of the groups referred to in clauses (1), (2), and (3) priority of selection shall be in numerical order according to the numbers of the Federal Reserve Districts, (b) the President and the First Vice President of the same Federal Reserve Bank shall not serve at the same time as members of the Interim Committee, and (c) whenever a regular member or regular alternate of the Federal Open Market Committee or a person having a higher priority as indicated in clauses (1), (2), and (3) becomes available he shall become a member of the Interim Committee in the place of the person then on the Interim Committee having the lowest priority. The Interim Committee is hereby authorized to take action by majority vote of those present whenever one or more members -13-thereof are present, provided that an affirmative vote for the action taken is cast by at least one regular member, regular alternate, or President of a Federal Reserve Bank. The delegation of authority and other procedures set forth above shall be effective only during such period or periods as there are available less than a total of seven regular members and regular alternates of the Federal Open Market Committee.  As used herein the term "regular member" refers to a member of the Federal Open Market Committee duly appointed or elected in accordance with existing law; the term "regular alternate" refers to an alternate of the Committee duly elected in accordance with existing law and serving in the absence of the regular member for whom he was elected; and the term "alternate at large" refers to any other duly elected alternate of the Committee at a time when the member in whose absence he was elected to serve is available.  RESOLUTION OF FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE AUTHORIZING CERTAIN ACTIONS BY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS DURING AN EMERGENCY Amended February 6, 1990 The Federal Open Market Committee hereby authorizes each Federal Reserve Bank to take any or all of the actions set forth below during and following a national security emergency when such Federal Reserve Bank finds itself unable after reasonable efforts to be in communication with the Federal Open Market Committee (or with the Interim Committee acting in lieu of the Federal Open Market Committee) or when the Federal Open Market Committee (or such Interim Committee) is unable to function. Action(s) under this authorization will be taken by a Federal Reserve Bank only after reasonable efforts have been made to consult with the Chairman of the Committee or if the latter is not available with the Vice Chairman of the Committee or if both the Chairman and the Vice Chairman are not available, with whatever member of the Board of Governors may be available to serve as Acting Chairman as provided for by the Committee's Rules of Organization. In addition, to the extent feasible, the action(s) should be coordinated with other Reserve Banks with which the Reserve Bank is able to communicate.  (1) Whenever it deems it necessary in the light of economic conditions and the general credit situation then prevailing (after taking into account the possibility of providing necessary credit through advances secured by direct obligations of the United States under the last paragraph of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act), such Federal Reserve Bank may purchase and sell obligations of the United States for its own account, either outright or under repurchase agreement, from and to banks, dealers or other holders of such obligations.  (2) Such Federal Reserve Bank may engage in operations of the types specified in the Committee's authorization for System foreign currency operations when requested to do so by an authorized official of the U.S.  Treasury Department; provided, however, that such Bank shall take all -14-steps practicable at the time to insure as far as possible that, in light of the information available on other System foreign currency operations, its own operations do not result in the aggregate in breaching any of the several dollar limits specified in the authorization.  Authority to take the actions set forth shall be effective only until such time as the Federal Reserve Bank is able again to establish communications with the Federal Open Market Committee (or the Interim Committee), and such Committee is then functioning.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 18-19, 1989, were approved.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period December 19, 1989, through February 6, 1990, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period December 19, 1989, through February 6, 1990, were ratified.  With Ms. Seger and Messrs. Hoskins and Stern dissenting, the following longer-run policy for 1990 was approved by the Committee: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990.  The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 5 to 9 percent for the year.  The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets. With Ms. Seger and Messrs. Boykin and Hoskins dissenting from the operational paragraph on policy implementation in the period immediately ahead, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is continuing to expand despite weakness in the industrial sector. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased substantially in January after growing at a reduced pace on average in previous months; a surge in the service-producing sector and a weather-related rebound in construction were only partly offset by a large decline in the manufacturing sector. The civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.3 percent. Partial data suggest that industrial production in January was appreciably below its average in the fourth quarter. Adjusted for inflation, strong gains in consumer spending on services in the fourth quarter offset declines in consumer purchases of goods, especially motor vehicles. Unusually cold weather depressed housing starts appreciably in December, and residential construction in the fourth quarter was little changed from its third-quarter level. Business capital spending, adjusted for inflation, declined in the fourth quarter as a result of lower expenditures on motor vehicles and strike activity in the aircraft industry; spending on other types of capital goods was strong, however, and new orders for equipment picked up toward the end of the year. The nominal U.S.  merchandise trade deficit widened in October-November from the third-quarter rate. Consumer prices had risen somewhat more rapidly toward the end of 1989, and prices of food and energy apparently increased substantially further in January. The latest data on labor compensation suggest no significant change in prevailing trends.  Interest rates have risen in intermediate- and long-term debt markets since the Committee meeting on December 18-19; in short-term markets, the federal funds rate has declined, and other short-term rates show mixed changes over the period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined further over the intermeeting period; most of the -16-depreciation was against the German mark and related European currencies, and there was little change against the yen.  Growth of M2 slowed in January, almost entirely reflecting a drop in transaction deposits. Growth of M3 also slowed in January as assets of thrift institutions and their associated funding needs apparently continued to contract. For the year 1989, M2 expanded at a rate a little below the middle of the Committee's annual range, and M3 grew at a rate slightly below the lower bound of its annual range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990.  The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 5 to 9 percent for the year.  The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of progress toward price stability, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from December through March at annual rates of about 7 and 3-1/2 percent respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent. -17-It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Wednesday, March 27, 1990.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary Secretary's note: Effective February 16, 1990, available members of the Committee approved a recommendation by the Manager for Domestic Operations to relax temporarily some of the constraints that apply to collateralized System loans of government securities to primary dealers.  This action was taken to facilitate the orderly liquidation of the government securities position of a troubled primary dealer in such obligations.  In accordance with usual practice, all securities loans would continue to be collateralized by U.S.  government obligations of greater current market value.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Corrigan, Angell, Boehne, Boykin, Hoskins, Johnson, Kelley, and Stern. Votes against this action: None. Absent and not voting: Mr. LaWare and Ms. Seger.  The temporary liberalization of securities lending terms was terminated effective March 13, 1990.
