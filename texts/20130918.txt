Chris Burke and Jonathan P. McCarthy, Vice Presi-dents, Federal Reserve Bank of New York  Eric T. Swanson, Senior Research Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco  Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-eral Reserve's Balance Sheet The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on developments in domestic and foreign fi-nancial markets as well as the System open market op-erations during the period since the Federal Open Mar-ket Committee (FOMC) met on July 30Œ31, 2013.  The review included a report that the System's purchases of longer-term assets did not appear to have had an ad-verse effect on the functioning of the markets for Treasury securities or agency mortgage-backed securi-ties (MBS), and that the Open Market Desk's opera-tions in both sectors had proceeded smoothly.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  There were no intervention operations in foreign cur-rencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period. In support of the Committee's longer-run planning for improvements in the implementation of monetary poli-cy, the staff presented an update on the potential for establishing a fixed-rate, full-allotment overnight re-verse repurchase agreement (RRP) facility.  The presen-tation summarized initial discussions with financial market firms about how such a facility might affect money market interest rates and intermediation flows, what the relationship might be between the facility rate and other money market rates, and how the different types of firms might view the facility.  Overall, the in-quiries suggested that the facility could be an effective additional tool for managing money market interest rates and helping to support a floor on those rates.  Meeting participants discussed the potential role for an overnight RRP facility, the possible effects on the func-tioning of the federal funds market or the structure of money markets, and the usefulness of expanding the Desk's test operations in RRPs.  Meeting participants generally supported a proposal to authorize the Desk to conduct a limited exercise in order to provide some insight into the potential usage of an overnight RRP facility as well as additional experience with operational aspects of such a facility.  One participant, however, preferred that further analysis be undertaken before proceeding with the exercise.  A number of meeting participants emphasized that their interest in these op-erations reflected an ongoing effort to improve the technical execution of policy and did not signal any change in the Committee's views about policy going forward.  Following the discussion, the Committee unanimously approved the following resolution:  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a series of fixed-rate, overnight reverse repurchase op-erations involving U.S. Government securi-ties, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and in-terest by, any agency of the United States, for the purpose of assessing operational readi-ness.  The reverse repurchase operations au-thorized by this resolution shall be (i) offered at a fixed rate that may vary from zero to five basis points, (ii) offered at up to a capped al-lotment per counterparty of $1 billion per day and (iii) for an overnight term, or such longer term as is warranted to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading con-ventions.  The System Open Market Account Manager will inform the FOMC in advance of the terms of the planned operations.   These operations may be announced when authorized by the Chairman, may begin when authorized by the Chairman on or after Sep-tember 23, 2013, and shall be authorized through the FOMC meeting that ends on January 29, 2014.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the September 17Œ18 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to increase at a moderate rate.  Private-sector employment rose further in July and August, but the unemployment rate was still elevated.  Total consumer price inflation picked up in recent months but continued to be mod-est, and measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. Private nonfarm employment continued to expand in July and August, but at a somewhat slower pace than in the first half of the year, while total government em-ployment edged down on balance.  The unemployment rate declined further to 7.3 percent in August.  The labor force participation rate also decreased, leaving the employment-to-population ratio essentially unchanged in recent months.  Other indicators of labor market activity also were mixed.  Measures of firms' hiring plans moved up, initial claims for unemployment insur- ance declined, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons decreased a little.  However, household expectations of the labor market situation deteriorated somewhat, rates of job openings and gross private-sector hiring were little changed, on net, and the rate of long-duration unemployment rose slightly. Manufacturing production increased in August after a decline in July, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization was unchanged, on balance, over those two months.  Automakers' schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies would remain roughly flat in the coming months, but broader indicators of manu-facturing production, such as the readings on new or-ders from the national and regional manufacturing sur-veys, pointed to moderate increases in factory output in the near term. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) were flat in July.  In August, nominal retail sales, excluding those at motor vehicle and parts outlets, edged up, while sales of light motor vehicles rose notably.  Recent information on key factors that influence consumer spending were mixed:  Households' net worth likely expanded further as home prices posted additional gains through July, but real disposable incomes in-creased only a little in July and consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers moved lower in August and early Sep-tember. Improvements in housing-sector activity appeared to slow, possibly reflecting the rise in mortgage rates since the spring.  Starts and permits of new single-family homes moved down in July, but the level of permit issuance was still somewhat above that for starts and pointed to moderate increases in construction in sub-sequent months.  In the multifamily sector, both starts and permits rose in July but construction remained around the same level as early in the year.  Sales of ex-isting homes increased, but new home sales declined. Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to be subdued going into the third quarter.  Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding air-craft declined again in July.  However, nominal new orders for these capital goods continued to be above the level of shipments, pointing to increases in ship-ments in subsequent months, and other forward-looking indicators, such as surveys of business condi-tions, were consistent with moderate gains in spending for business equipment in the near term.  Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential construction increased in July but were still at a low level.  Recent book-value data for inventory-sales ratios, along with readings on inventories from national and regional manufacturing surveys, did not point to significant in-ventory imbalances. Reductions in real federal government purchases ap-peared to persist:  Defense spending continued to de-crease in July and August, while federal employment edged down further.  Real state and local government purchases looked to be about flat-the payrolls of   these governments expanded slightly, on balance, in July and August, and state and local construction ex-penditures seemed to be leveling off. The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed substan-tially in June before widening in July to a level near its second-quarter average.  Exports expanded in June, with particular strength in industrial supplies and capi-tal goods, before stepping down somewhat in July.  Imports fell in June but then largely recovered in July, driven by swings in imports of oil and consumer goods. Total U.S. inflation, as measured by the PCE price in-dex through July and by the consumer price index through August, was about 1½ percent over the pre-ceding 12-month period for each series.  Consumer food prices only edged up in July and August, while energy prices were little changed, on net, over those two months, and retail gasoline prices moved down in the first half of September.  Core consumer price infla-tion, which excludes food and energy, was modest in July and August.  Both near-term and longer-term infla-tion expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed in August and early September. Measures of labor compensation indicated that increas-es in nominal wages were still subdued.  Both compen-sation per hour and unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector rose modestly over the year ending in the second quarter, as there were only slight gains in productivity.  In July and August, increases in average hourly earnings for all employees were fairly slow on balance. Average foreign economic growth remained muted in the first half of the year, although there were some no-table divergences across countries.  Growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) picked up in the second quarter in the United Kingdom and remained strong in Japan, recent data suggested that the euro-area econo-my was coming out of recession, and economic indica-tors were positive for China and several other emerging market economies (EMEs) in Asia.  However, real  GDP fell in the second quarter in Mexico and deceler-ated notably in India.  Foreign inflation was generally subdued.  Monetary policy remained highly accommo-dative in the advanced economies, but some EME cen-tral banks moved toward tighter monetary policy in the face of capital outflows and depreciation pressures.  An exception was the Bank of Mexico, which cut its policy rate in response to economic weakness. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Longer-term interest rates rose over the intermeeting period, while equity prices were fairly volatile but ended the period modestly higher.  The move in interest rates appeared to be importantly influenced by shifting ex-pectations about monetary policy. The path of the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotes steepened notably during the period, in part reflecting some increase in uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy as indicated by option-implied measures of uncertainty about the future path of the policy rate.  In contrast to market-based quotes, the results from the Desk's September survey of pri-mary dealers showed little change in the projected path of the policy rate relative to that in the July survey.  However, the survey also suggested that primary deal-ers marked up somewhat the odds that the FOMC would begin to cut the pace of asset purchases at its September meeting, a result generally in line with other surveys of market participants. Five- and 10-year Treasury yields increased about       25 basis points over the intermeeting period.  Yields on corporate bonds, agency MBS, and Treasury inflation-protected securities rose about in line with those on nominal Treasury securities. Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets were generally stable during the period since the July FOMC meeting.  Responses to the September Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms suggested little change over the preceding three months in the credit terms applicable to most classes of coun-terparties covered by the survey.  A moderate net frac-tion of respondents reported a decline in the use of financial leverage by hedge funds, and a more substan-tial net fraction reported a decrease in financial leverage used by real estate investment trusts.  In response to special questions in the survey, dealers indicated that, during the period of heightened volatility beginning in May and extending into early July, liquidity and func-tioning had deteriorated in a number of fixed-income markets. Stock prices for financial-sector firms underperformed the broad equity market somewhat over the intermeet-ing period.  However, spreads on credit default swaps (CDS) for the largest bank holding companies re-mained stable at levels near the bottom of their range over the past few years. Credit flows to nonfinancial businesses remained solid in the face of higher longer-term interest rates.  Relative to the typical summer lull, gross issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans was robust in August; com-mercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks' books continued to expand moderately, on average, in July and August.  Commercial real estate (CRE) loans at banks accelerated over the summer, and issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities remained strong despite slightly wider spreads on those securities. Recent information about household credit was mixed.  Mortgage rates increased further over the intermeeting period, and credit standards for mortgage loans re-mained tight.  Nonetheless, applications for new mort-gages declined only modestly, apparently supported by improvements in labor market conditions and some pent-up demand.  Higher mortgage rates weighed more heavily on applications to refinance existing mortgages, which decreased significantly.  The pace of home price appreciation moderated a bit in July, although it was still strong.  In nonmortgage credit, automobile loans and student loans both continued to expand rapidly, while balances on revolving consumer credit stayed about flat.  Issuance of consumer asset-backed securi-ties remained robust in July and August. In the municipal bond market, despite the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings for Detroit and greater scruti-ny of Puerto Rico's fiscal problems, broader market sentiment was reportedly supported by the lessening in budget pressures for many other state and local gov-ernments.  Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds was solid in August, and yield ratios on general-obligation municipal bonds over comparable Treasury securities were about unchanged, on balance, over the intermeeting period. Bank credit declined in July and August amid the gen-eral rise in longer-term interest rates.  While banks' holdings of assets with longer duration, such as resi-dential mortgages, decreased, growth in C&I, CRE, and automobile loans-which are more likely to have float-ing interest rates or relatively short maturities, and therefore less duration risk-tended to hold up in re-cent months.  M2 increased significantly in July and August, as the selloff in fixed-income markets that began in May, along with the associated outflows from bond funds, likely continued to support reallocations into liquid M2 assets.  The monetary base continued to expand rapid-ly, primarily reflecting the rise in reserve balances re-sulting from the Federal Reserve's asset purchases. Against a backdrop of higher interest rates in the ad-vanced economies and slowing economic growth in the EMEs, several EME currencies came under downward pressure in August; yields and CDS premiums on EME sovereign debt increased, particularly for those econo-mies experiencing sharp currency depreciations; and investors continued to decrease their holdings in EME mutual funds.  In response, some EME authorities took actions to support their currencies, including tightening monetary policy, modifying capital controls, and purchasing their currencies in foreign exchange markets.  On net over the period, the dollar ended little changed on a trade-weighted basis against a broad set of currencies, but it appreciated notably against the currencies of India, Indonesia, and Turkey.  Equity prices in Germany increased substantially and sovereign yields in the United Kingdom and Germany continued to rise as data on economic activity in Europe generally improved over the period, while yield spreads of Span-ish and Italian sovereign securities relative to German government debt declined a bit further. The staff reported on potential risks to financial stabil-ity, including those highlighted by the rise in yields and volatility on longer-term fixed-income securities since the spring.  The increase in yields appeared to reduce investors' appetite for taking duration risk, but if a sig-nificant volume of bond investors moved to sell at a future time, issues surrounding dealer capacity and will-ingness to make markets in volatile conditions could again amplify price movements.  On balance, the vul-nerability of the financial system appeared moderate, as loss-absorbing capital had increased and the reliance on short-term funding and the exposure of financial insti-tutions to nonfinancial credit risk had decreased.  Nonetheless, a number of potential shocks could prove challenging to markets and institutions, including a fail-ure to raise the U.S. federal debt limit, financial instabil-ity in EMEs, and geopolitical events in the Middle East. Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting, the projection for real GDP growth in the second half of this year was revised down a little from the one prepared for the previous meeting.  The staff's forecast for real GDP over the medium term also was revised down somewhat, reflect-ing higher projected paths for both longer-term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, along with slightly lower projected paths for equity and home prices.  The staff still anticipated that the pace of expansion in real GDP this year would only moderately exceed the growth rate of potential output but contin-ued to forecast that real GDP would accelerate in 2014 and 2015, supported by an eventual easing in the ef-fects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, in-creases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial condi-tions, and accommodative monetary policy.  In 2016, real GDP growth was projected to begin to edge down toward the growth rate of potential output.  Over the projection period, the expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets, and the unemployment rate was ex-pected to decline gradually. The staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meet-ing.  In the near term, the staff continued to project that inflation would be modest in the second half of this year but higher than the readings posted in the first half.  Over the medium term, with longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be modest, and resource slack persisting over most of the projec-tion period, inflation was forecast to be subdued through 2016. The staff viewed the uncertainty around the forecast for economic activity as similar to its normal level over the past 20 years.  However, the risks were viewed as skewed to the downside, reflecting concerns about the economic effects of the recent tightening in U.S. finan-cial market conditions, the resolution of federal fiscal policy issues in the coming months, the economic and financial stresses in the EMEs, and the ability of the U.S. economy to weather potential future adverse shocks.  The staff did not see the uncertainty around its outlook for inflation as unusually high, and the risks were viewed as balanced. Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting par-ticipants-5 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participated in the deliberations-submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unem- ployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2016 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of ap-propriate monetary policy.  The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  These economic projections and policy assessments are de-scribed in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is attached as an addendum to these minutes. In their discussion of the economic situation and out-look, meeting participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace, albeit somewhat more slowly than earli-er anticipated, and they generally indicated that the broad contours of the outlook further out had not changed materially since their July meeting.  Partici-pants continued to project the rate of growth of eco-nomic activity to strengthen over coming years, sup-ported by highly accommodative monetary policy and the gradual abatement of the headwinds that have been slowing the pace of economic recovery, such as  household-sector deleveraging, tight credit conditions for some households and businesses, and fiscal re-straint.  Accordingly, the unemployment rate was pro-jected to continue to decline over time toward levels judged to be consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.  While downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market were generally viewed as having diminished, on balance, since last fall, a number of significant risks remained, including those related to the potential economic effects of the sizable increases in interest rates since the spring, ongoing fiscal drag, and the possible fallout from near-term fiscal debates.  Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from fluctuations that large-ly reflected changes in energy prices, and participants generally saw it as moving back gradually to 2 percent in the medium term. In the household sector, consumer spending continued to advance, but incoming data on retail sales were somewhat weaker than expected.  Auto sales, however, remained strong, supported in part by steady interest rates on auto loans, which, unlike mortgage rates, did not rise substantially in recent months.  Despite the continued improvement in household balance sheets, a number of factors were mentioned as possible re-straints on spending, including declines in consumer confidence, concerns about job security and availability, and the lingering effects of this year's payroll tax in-crease.  While the housing sector continued to strengthen, supported by improving fundamentals and gains in house prices, the increases in mortgage rates since the spring were seen as a potential risk.  The ex-tent to which the higher mortgage rates had materially affected that sector remained unclear, with the excep-tion of the sharp decline in refinancing activity.  But it was noted that recent softness in housing starts and home sales might well reflect some restraint from those higher rates. Business contacts in selected parts of the country were reported to be cautiously optimistic, consistent with encouraging responses to a number of business sur-veys.  Nonetheless, uncertainties regarding the outlook for the economy and fiscal and regulatory policies were reportedly continuing to weigh on business deci-sionmaking, with firms focused on improving their balance sheets and enhancing productivity and still quite cautious about expanding their workforces.  Re-ports on manufacturing activity pointed to some re-bound, with production related to autos the most nota-ble area of strength, and activity in the energy sector continued to expand at a steady pace.  In the agricul-tural sector, farmland values increased further, even though farm income was reported to be declining.  Some business contacts indicated that wage and price pressures were subdued; however, in one District, con-tacts pointed to rising wage pressures and labor short-ages. Participants discussed the extent to which the ongoing tightening in fiscal policy was likely to further restrain economic activity in the second half of this year, with one participant noting that the effects of the federal sequestration appeared to be less pronounced than previously anticipated.  However, a number of others pointed to heightened uncertainty about the course of federal fiscal policy over coming months, including the potential for a government shutdown or strains related to the debt ceiling debate, which posed downside risks to the economic outlook. In discussing labor market developments, a number of participants indicated that gains in payrolls in the July and August employment reports were disappointing, but one participant also noted that seasonal adjustment tended to be challenging during the summer months.  Taking a range of data into account, participants gener-ally agreed that labor market conditions had improved meaningfully since the start of the asset purchase pro- gram in September 2012.  Participants discussed how to reconcile the notable decline in the unemployment rate over the past year with the only moderate pace of expansion in real GDP.  One possible explanation was that, to the extent the decline in the unemployment rate was primarily driven by a fall in the labor force partici-pation rate and low productivity growth, such a decline might overstate the degree of improvement in broader labor market conditions.  Indeed, the continued low readings on the employment-to-population ratio were supportive of this explanation, suggesting that overall labor market conditions had not improved as much as the unemployment rate would indicate.  An alternative explanation for the significant improvement in the la-bor market performance despite the moderate growth in real GDP over the past year was that growth had been understated somewhat; notably, some research suggested that real gross domestic income, which ex-panded at a somewhat faster pace than real GDP, may provide better information about overall economic ac-tivity.  Despite recent declines in the unemployment rate, one participant noted the risk that the longer the duration of elevated unemployment, the more likely it was that the labor market and economy would experi-ence some lasting structural damage.  While judging the extent of structural damage continued to be quite diffi-cult, one piece of evidence consistent with this view was the apparent decline in the job-finding rate of the long-term unemployed. Despite the reversal of some transitory factors that had contributed to the earlier softness in inflation, recent readings continued to be below the Committee's   longer-run objective of 2 percent.  However, partici-pants generally expected inflation to pick up over the coming year as the pace of economic growth accelerat-ed and slack in resource utilization diminished further, although to a rate still below the Committee's longer-run objective. Participants discussed financial market developments, including their views on the extent to which the rise in longer-term interest rates since May reflected growing confidence about the economic outlook or a percep-tion by financial markets that monetary policy would be less accommodative going forward than had been pre-viously anticipated.  Several participants judged that overall financial conditions had tightened notably over the past few months, as seen most importantly in the rise in mortgage rates.  While acknowledging that it was too early to assess the effects of such an increase, they expressed concerns that tighter financial conditions might weigh on the recovery in the housing sector.  A few others observed that the increase in longer-term yields in recent months had not seemed to leave a meaningful imprint on other asset prices, suggesting that the effects on the economy were likely to be rela-tively muted.  While recognizing the potentially signifi-cant impact of higher mortgage rates on the housing market, these same participants pointed to higher equi-ty prices, the further gradual loosening of terms in bank lending, and the continued availability of credit at inex-pensive terms in corporate debt markets as signs that financial conditions more generally had not tightened materially.  In any case, however, the assessment of the adverse effects of the increase in longer-term rates on financial conditions and ultimately on economic activity would depend importantly upon the extent to which rates stabilized at current levels or instead continued to rise. Participants also touched on the implications for finan-cial stability resulting from the increase in interest rates, focusing on the effects on securities held by banking and other nonbank institutions, the unwinding of lever-aged trades, and the liquidity and functioning of a number of fixed-income markets.  One participant not-ed that, notwithstanding the recent rise in interest rates, net interest margins remained under pressure at com-munity and regional banks, and as a result many of  these banks continued to add to risk exposures.  An-other participant raised the possibility that financial stability risks might arise from recent adverse develop-ments in municipal bond markets.  It was also noted that financial conditions in a number of EMEs had tightened as a result of some depreciation of their cur-rencies, an increase in yields and borrowing costs, and some capital outflows as measured by withdrawals from bond funds.  More broadly, a couple of partici-pants noted the complexities related to the interaction between the stance of monetary policy and the vulner-abilities in the financial system. In their discussion of the path for monetary policy, participants debated the advantages and disadvantages of reducing the pace of the Committee's asset purchas-es at this meeting, focusing importantly on whether the conditions presented to the public in June for reducing the pace of asset purchases had yet been met.  In gen-eral, those who preferred to maintain for now the pace of purchases viewed incoming data as having been on the disappointing side and, despite clear improvements in labor market conditions since the purchase pro-gram's inception in September 2012, were not yet ade-quately confident of continued progress.  Many of   these participants had revised down their forecasts for  economic activity or pointed to near-term risks and uncertainties.  For example, questions were raised about the effects on the housing sector and on the broader economy of the tightening in financial condi-tions in recent months, as well as about the considera-ble risks surrounding fiscal policy.  Moreover, the an-nouncement of a reduction in asset purchases at this meeting might trigger an additional, unwarranted tight-ening of financial conditions, perhaps because markets would read such an announcement as signaling the Committee's willingness, notwithstanding mixed recent data, to take an initial step toward exit from its highly accommodative policy.  As a result of such concerns, a number of participants thought that risk-management considerations called for a cautious approach and that, in light of the ambiguous cast of recent readings on the economy, it would be prudent to await further evidence of progress before reducing the pace of asset purchas-es.  Consistent with the framework discussed by the Chairman during the June press conference, asset pur-chases were contingent on the Committee's ongoing assessment of the economic outlook and were not on a preset course; this approach implied a need to adapt and to adjust asset purchases in response to changes in economic conditions in order to preserve the Commit-tee's credibility.  With many outside observers expect-ing a decision to reduce purchases at this meeting, some participants emphasized a need to clearly com-municate the rationale behind any decision not to do so, in order to avoid conveying a message of pessimism regarding the economic outlook or to reinforce the distinction between decisions concerning the pace of purchases and those concerning the federal funds rate.  One participant suggested that postponing the reduc-tion in the pace of asset purchases would also allow time for the Committee to further discuss and to im-plement a clarification or strengthening of its forward guidance for the federal funds rate, which could temper the risk that a future downward adjustment in asset purchases would cause an undesirable tightening of financial conditions. The participants who spoke in favor of moderating the pace of securities purchases at this meeting also cited the incoming data, but viewed those data as broadly consistent with the Committee's outlook for the labor market at the time of the June FOMC meeting when the contingent expectation that the pace of asset pur-chases would be reduced later in the year was first pre-sented to the public.  Moreover, they highlighted what they saw as meaningful cumulative progress in labor market conditions since the purchase program began.  Those participants generally were satisfied that inves-tors had come to understand the data-dependent nature of the Committee's thinking about asset purchases, and, because they judged that the conditions laid out in June had been met, they believed that the credibility of the Committee would best be served by announcing a downward adjustment in asset purchases at this meet-ing.  With the markets apparently viewing a cut in pur-chases as the most likely outcome, it was noted that the postponement of such an announcement to later in the year or beyond could have significant implications for the effectiveness of Committee communications.  In particular, concerns were expressed that a delay could potentially undermine the credibility or predictability of monetary policy by, for example, increasing uncertainty about the Committee's reaction function and about its commitment to the forward guidance for the federal funds rate, with the result of an increase in volatility in financial markets.  Moreover, maintaining the pace of purchases could be perceived as a sign that the FOMC had turned more pessimistic about the economic out-look.  Finally, it was noted that if the Committee did not pare back its purchases in these circumstances, it might be difficult to explain a cut in coming months, absent clearly stronger data on the economy and a swift resolution of federal fiscal uncertainties.  Most of the participants leaning toward a downward adjustment in the pace of asset purchases also indicated that they fa-vored a relatively small reduction to signal the Commit-tee's intention to proceed cautiously. With regard to adjustments in the pace of asset pur-chases, whether at this or a future meeting, a few par-ticipants expressed a preference for not cutting MBS purchases but reducing purchases only of Treasury se-curities initially, with the intent of continuing to sup-port the recovery in the housing sector.  However, the appeal of including both types of securities in any re-duction was also mentioned.  In addition, in an effort to reduce uncertainty about how the Committee might adjust its purchases in response to economic develop-ments and to alleviate some of the related communica-tions issues, one participant suggested an approach that would mechanically link the reduction in asset purchas-es to numerical values for the unemployment rate, with the goal of ending the program when the unemploy-ment rate reached a stated level. Participants also discussed the potential for clarifying or strengthening the Committee's forward guidance for the federal funds rate.  To the extent that financial markets have at times interpreted the Committee's communications regarding the asset purchase program  as also signaling information about the federal funds rate target, participants thought it might be important to reiterate the distinction between the two, and a clari-fication or strengthening of the forward guidance might help to reinforce this message.  In part toward this end, participants mentioned several possible steps that might be considered, including stating that the Com-mittee would not raise its target for the federal funds rate if the inflation rate was expected to run below a given level or providing additional information on the Committee's intentions regarding the federal funds rate after the 6½ percent unemployment threshold was reached.  One participant stressed that the Committee could use the full range of its tools, including forward guidance, to further improve the alignment of the   medium-term outlook for employment and inflation with its longer-term goals.  In light of the importance of credibility for the effectiveness of the forward guid-ance for the federal funds rate, participants noted the possible implications of uncertainties related to the Federal Reserve leadership transition in considering the appropriate timing of any enhancements to the guid-ance.   In discussing the projections for the target federal funds rate at the end of 2016 as reported in the SEP, some participants highlighted the importance of com-municating to the public the reasons why the policy rates that were projected by most, but not all, partici-pants appeared to remain at low levels even as the un-employment rate and inflation by then were expected to be close to their longer-run values.  In particular, if economic headwinds died away only slowly, as a num-ber of participants expected, the achievement of the Committee's employment and price stability objectives would likely require keeping the federal funds rate be-low its longer-run equilibrium value for some time even as economic conditions improved.  In light of the po-tential difficulties in succinctly conveying this infor-mation in the Committee's policy statement, the Chairman's postmeeting press conference and the minutes were mentioned as more appropriate vehicles for providing this information.  A couple of partici-pants also remarked that they viewed their projections of a low federal funds rate in 2016 as reflecting a com-mitment to support the economy by maintaining a more accommodative policy for longer. Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that eco-nomic activity was expanding at a moderate pace.  Some indicators of labor market conditions showed further improvement in recent months, but the unem-ployment rate remained elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the hous-ing sector was strengthening, but mortgage rates had risen further and fiscal policy was restraining growth.  The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace, resulting in a gradual decline in the un-employment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.  Members generally contin-ued to see the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall, but indicated that the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market.  Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but   longer-term inflation expectations were stable, and the Committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its objective over the medium term.  Members recognized, however, that inflation persistently below the Committee's 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance. In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members reviewed the degree of improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since the asset purchase program began a year ago and judged that, taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment, the improvement was consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader econ-omy.  However, all members but one judged that it would be appropriate for the Committee to await more evidence that progress would be sustained before ad-justing the pace of asset purchases.  In the view of one member, the progress to date in labor markets and in broader economic conditions amply supported a reduc-tion in purchases.  During the exchange of views on whether to trim the flow of asset purchases at this meeting, a number of members emphasized the contin-gent and data-dependent nature of the Committee's purchase program.  In light of the mixed data recently, including inflation readings that remained below the Committee's longer-run objective, and the concerns over near-term fiscal uncertainties, some members in-dicated that they preferred to await more evidence that their expectation of continuing improvement would be realized.  But with financial markets appearing to ex-pect a reduction in purchases at this meeting, concerns were raised about the effectiveness of FOMC commu-nications if the Committee did not take that step.  For  several members, the various considerations made the decision to maintain an unchanged pace of asset pur-chases at this meeting a relatively close call.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee decided to continue adding policy accommodation by purchasing additional MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month and to maintain its existing reinvestment policies.  In addition, the Committee reaffirmed its in-tention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to      ¼ percent and retained its forward guidance that it an-ticipates that this exceptionally low range for the feder-al funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, infla-tion between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well an-chored. Members also discussed the wording of the policy statement to be issued following the meeting.  In addi-tion to updating its description of the state of the economy, the Committee decided to underline its con-cern about the tightening of financial conditions ob-served in recent months.  It also acknowledged the im-provement in economic activity and labor market con-ditions since its asset purchase program began, while emphasizing that it was prepared to be patient and await more evidence that progress would be sustained before adjusting downward the pace of purchases.  The Committee also adopted language to the effect that, in judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases at its coming meetings, it would assess whether incom-ing information continued to support its expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and of inflation moving back toward its longer-run objec-tive.  Finally, the Committee reiterated the contingent nature of the outlook for asset purchases, indicating that asset purchases were not on a preset course and that the Committee's decisions about their pace would continue to depend on its economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.   At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-cute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price sta-bility.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to    ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as nec-essary to maintain such conditions.  The Desk is directed to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and to continue purchasing agency mortgage-backed securi-ties at a pace of about $40 billion per month.  The Committee also directs the Desk to en-gage in dollar roll and coupon swap transac-tions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.  The Commit-tee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting   principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency    mortgage-backed securities.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Sec-retary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the Sys-tem's balance sheet that could affect the at-tainment over time of the Committee's ob-jectives of maximum employment and price stability.  The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-low to be released at 2:00 p.m.:  Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July sug-gests that economic activity has been ex-panding at a moderate pace.  Some indicators of labor market conditions have shown fur-ther improvement in recent months, but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed in-vestment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen further and fiscal policy is re-straining economic growth.  Apart from fluc-tuations due to changes in energy prices, in-flation has been running below the Commit-tee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum em-ployment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy ac-commodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall, but the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if sus-tained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market.  The Committee recognizes that inflation persis-tently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back to-ward its objective over the medium term. Taking into account the extent of federal fis-cal retrenchment, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program a year ago as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.  However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases.  Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incom-ing information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agen-cy mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming infor-mation continues to support the Commit-tee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective.  Asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's eco-nomic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchas-es. To support continued progress toward max-imum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a consider-able time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at  0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above  6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well an-chored.  In determining how long to main-tain a highly accommodative stance of mone-tary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indica-tors of inflation pressures and inflation ex-pectations, and readings on financial devel-opments.  When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employ-ment and inflation of 2 percent.  Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. Dudley, James Bullard, Charles L. Evans, Jerome H.  Powell, Eric Rosengren, Jeremy C. Stein, Daniel K. Tarullo, and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against this action:  Esther L. George. Ms. George dissented because she saw recent infor-mation on the economy as sufficiently positive to war-rant a reduction in the pace of the Committee's asset purchases at this meeting.  In her view, waiting for more evidence of progress discounted the cumulative improvement in the economy as well as the potential costs of ongoing purchases.  Accordingly, not only would a reduction be appropriate in light of the ongo-ing improvement in labor market conditions, but it also would support the credibility and predictability of monetary policy because it would be seen as following through on the Committee's earlier communications about the outlook for the asset purchase program.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on TuesdayŒWednesday, October 29Œ30, 2013.  The meeting adjourned at 11:15 a.m. on Sep-tember 18, 2013. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on August 20, 2013, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on July 30Œ31, 2013.   _____________________________ William B. English Secretary  Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the September 17Œ18, 2013, Fed-eral Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meet-ing participants-5 members of the Board of Gover-nors and the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participated in the deliberations-submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2016 and over the longer run.  Each participant's assessment was based on information available at the time of the meet-ing plus his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projections rep-resent each participant's judgment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.   Ap-propriate monetary policy  is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve's objectives of maximum employ-ment and stable prices. Overall, FOMC participants expected, under appropri-ate monetary policy, a pickup in economic growth, with the unemployment rate declining gradually (table 1 and figure 1).  Almost all of the participants projected that inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would rise to a level at or somewhat below the Com-mittee's 2 percent objective in 2016. Most participants judged that highly accommodative monetary policy was likely to remain warranted over the next few years to support continued progress to-ward maximum employment and a return to 2 percent inflation.  As shown in figure 2, a large majority of par-ticipants judged not only that it would be appropriate to wait until 2015 or later before beginning to increase the federal funds rate, but also that it would then be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate target rela-tively gradually.  Most participants viewed their eco-nomic projections as broadly consistent with a slowing in the pace of the Committee's purchases of longer-term securities this year and the completion of the pro-gram in mid-2014. Most participants saw the uncertainty associated with their outlook for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to that of the past 20 years.  In addition, most participants considered the risks to the outlook for the unemployment rate and inflation as broadly balanced.  A slim majority of the participants also judged that the risks to the outlook for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth were broadly bal-anced, while nearly as many indicated that the risks were weighted to the downside.

NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the pre-vious year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.  Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriatemonetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 18Œ19, 2013.    1.  The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.    2.  The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.    3.  Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants generally projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate mone-tary policy, real GDP growth would be similar in 2013 to its rate in 2012 and would increase in the 2014Œ16 period to a pace above what participants saw as the longer-run rate of output growth.  Many participants pointed to diminishing restraint from fiscal policy, pent-up demand for consumer and producer durables, or rising household net worth as contributing to the pickup in growth.  In addition, a number of partici-pants noted continued improvement in the housing sector, supported by rising employment and income and by improved credit availability. The central tendencies of participants' projections for real GDP growth were 2.0 to 2.3 percent in 2013,      2.9 to 3.1 percent in 2014, 3.0 to 3.5 percent in 2015, and 2.5 to 3.3 percent in 2016.  In general, participants' projections for growth in 2013, 2014, and, to a lesser extent, 2015 were below those collected in June.  Most participants attributed the downward revisions to their projections in 2013 and 2014 in part to weaker-than-expected incoming data, while some participants point-ed to tighter financial conditions.  The central tendency for the longer-run rate of growth of real GDP was    2.2 to 2.5 percent, little changed from June. Participants anticipated a gradual decline in the unem-ployment rate over the projection period.  The central tendencies of participants' forecasts for the unemploy-ment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 7.1 to 7.3 percent in 2013, 6.4 to 6.8 percent in 2014, 5.9 to 6.2 percent in 2015, and 5.4 to 5.9 percent in 2016.  These projections were little changed from June.  The central tendency of participants' estimates of the    longer-run normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy was 5.2 to 5.8 percent.  A majority of participants projected that the unemployment rate would be near or slightly above their individual estimates of its longer-run level at the end of 2016. Figures 3.A and 3.B show that participants' views re-garding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate in 2014 and 2015 remained dispersed.  This diversity reflected their individual as-sessments of the likely rate of improvement in the housing sector and in household balance sheets, the domestic implications of foreign economic develop-ments, the prospective path for U.S. fiscal policy, the likely evolution of financial conditions, and a number of other factors.  Relative to June, the dispersions of participants' projections for GDP growth in 2014 and 2015 narrowed to some extent, while the dispersions of projections for the unemployment rate in those years generally widened a bit. The Outlook for Inflation Participants' views on the broad outlook for inflation under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy were little changed from June.  Although most partici-pants revised up slightly their projection for PCE infla-tion in 2013, a number of participants revised down a bit their forecasts for 2014.  All participants anticipated that both headline and core inflation would rise gradu-ally over the next few years, and almost all participants expected inflation to be at or somewhat below the Committee's 2 percent objective in 2016.  Specifically, the central tendencies for PCE inflation were 1.1 to   1.2 percent in 2013, 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2014, 1.6 to 2.0 percent in 2015, and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016.  The central tendencies of the forecasts for core infla-tion were little changed from June and broadly similar to those for the headline measure over the projection period.  A number of participants viewed the combina-tion of stable inflation expectations and diminishing resource slack as important factors leading to a gradual pickup in inflation toward the Committee's longer-run objective.   Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the diver-sity of participants' views about the outlook for infla-tion.  The ranges of participants' projections for overall inflation in 2014 and 2015 widened slightly from June and were 1.2 to 2.0 percent in 2014 and 1.4 to 2.3 per-cent in 2015.  In 2016, the forecasts for PCE inflation were concentrated near the Committee's longer-run objective, though one participant expected inflation to be noticeably above the Committee's objective and another expected it to be ½ percentage point below.  Similar to the projections for headline inflation, the projections for core inflation became more concentrat-ed near the 2 percent objective in 2016 than in earlier years; however, the dispersion of the projections for core inflation in each year was lower than for headline inflation. Appropriate Monetary Policy As indicated in figure 2, most participants judged that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate would remain appropriate for the next few years.

Three par-ticipants judged that an increase in the federal funds rate in 2014 would be appropriate. All participants projected that the unemployment rate would be below the Committee's 6½ percent threshold at the end of the year in which they viewed the initial increase in the federal funds rate to be appropriate, and all but one judged that inflation would be at or below the Committee's longer-run objective.  Almost all par-ticipants projected that the unemployment rate would still be above their view of its longer-run level at the end of the year in which they saw the federal funds rate increasing from the effective lower bound. Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants' judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year from 2013 to 2016 and over the longer run.  As noted above, most participants judged that economic conditions would warrant maintaining the current low level of the federal funds rate until 2015.  Among the three partici-pants who saw the federal funds rate leaving the effec-tive lower bound earlier, projections for the federal funds rate at the end of 2014 ranged from 1 to 1¼ per-cent.  These three participants viewed the appropriate level of the federal funds rate as 3 percent or higher at the end of 2015, while the remainder of participants saw the appropriate level of the funds rate as 1½ per-cent or lower.  On balance, the dispersion of partici-pants' projections for the appropriate federal funds rate at the end of 2015 widened a bit from June, while the median value of the rate was unchanged. All of the participants who saw the first tightening in either 2015 or 2016 judged that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 would still be below their individual assessment of its expected   longer-run value.  In contrast, the three participants who saw the first tightening in 2014 believed that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 would be at their assessment of its longer-run level, which they viewed as either at or just above         4 percent.  Among all participants, estimates of the longer-run target federal funds rate ranged from 3¼ to about 4¼ percent, reflecting the Committee's inflation objective of 2 percent and participants' individual judgments about the appropriate longer-run level of the real federal funds rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy. Participants also described their views regarding the appropriate path of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.  Conditional on their respective economic outlooks, most participants judged that it would likely be appro-priate to begin to reduce the pace of the Committee's purchases of longer-term securities this year and to conclude purchases in the middle of 2014.  A couple of participants thought it appropriate for the first reduc-tion in the pace of asset purchases to occur later, and another specified that purchases likely would continue past midyear 2014; in contrast, a couple of participants thought that the program should be ended considerably sooner than the middle of next year. Participants' views of the appropriate path for mone-tary policy were informed by their judgments on the state of the economy, including the values of the un-employment rate and other labor market indicators that would be consistent with maximum employment, the extent to which the economy was currently falling short of maximum employment, the prospects for inflation to reach the Committee's longer-term objective of       2 percent, and the balance of risks around the outlook.  Some participants also mentioned the usefulness of examining the implications of alternative policy strate-gies for returning employment and inflation to      mandate-consistent levels over the medium term.  Uncertainty and Risks Most participants judged that the levels of uncertainty about their projections for real GDP growth and un-employment were broadly similar to the norm during the previous 20 years, although four participants con-tinued to see them as higher (figure 4).1  The number of participants who viewed the risks around their GDP projections as weighted to the downside was nearly equal to the number who viewed them as broadly bal-anced.  Most participants saw the risks around their unemployment projections as broadly balanced.  The main factors cited as contributing to the uncertainty and balance of risks around economic outcomes were the limits on the ability of monetary policy at the zero lower bound to respond to adverse shocks, as well as challenges associated with forecasting the path of fiscal policy  and  developments  abroad.  In  addition, some                                                  1 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1993 through 2012.  At the end of this summary, the box  Forecast Uncer-tainty  discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertain-ty in the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the participants' projections.

Participants reported little change in their assessments of the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks around their forecasts for overall PCE inflation and core inflation.  Eleven participants judged the levels of uncertainty associated with their forecasts for those inflation measures to be broadly similar to historical norms; the same number saw the risks to those projec-tions as broadly balanced.  Five participants saw the risks to their inflation forecasts as tilted to the down-side, reflecting, for example, the possibility that the current low levels of inflation could persist and become embedded in inflation expectations.  Conversely, a couple of participants cited upside risks to inflation stemming from the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy or concerns about the Committee's ability to shift to a less accommodative policy stance when it becomes appropriate to do so.

As described in the box  Forecast Uncertainty,  under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual out-comes for real GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past.  Further information may be found in David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2007),  Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Out-look from Historical Forecasting Errors,  Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2007-60 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November).   1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price meas-ure that has been most widely used in government and private eco-nomic forecasts.  Projection is percent change, fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.         Forecast Uncertainty    The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understand-ing of the basis for policy actions.  Consider-able uncertainty attends these projections, however.  The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce eco-nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect de-scriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myr-iad unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board's staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.  The pro-jection error ranges shown in the table il-lustrate the considerable uncertainty associat-ed with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, re-spectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty attending those projections is simi-lar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP  would  expand  within a range of  2.1 to  3.9 percent in the current year,  1.5 to 4.5  per- cent in the second year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the third year, and 1.1 to 4.9 percent in the fourth year.  The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 per-cent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third and fourth years. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over his-tory, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their pro-jections of each variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty in the past, as shown in table 2.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, participants judge whether each variable is more likely to be above or below their projec-tions of the most likely outcome.  These judg-ments about the uncertainty and the risks at-tending each participant's projections are dis-tinct from the diversity of participants' views about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast un-certainty is concerned with the risks associated with a particular projection rather than with divergences across a number of different pro-jections. As with real activity and inflation, the out-look for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each partic-ipant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve in an un-expected manner, then assessments of the ap-propriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward.
