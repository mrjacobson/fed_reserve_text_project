Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed- In a joint session of the Federal Open Market Commit-tee (FOMC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the manager of the System Open Mar-ket Account (SOMA) reported on developments in do-mestic and foreign financial markets as well as System open market operations conducted during the period since the Committee met on October 2829, 2014.  In addition, the manager reviewed the implications of re-cent foreign central bank policy actions for the interna-tional portion of the SOMA portfolio.  The manager also provided an update on staff work related to potential ar-rangements that would allow depository institutions to pledge funds held in a segregated account at the Federal Reserve as collateral in borrowing transactions with pri-vate creditors and which could potentially provide an ad-ditional supplementary tool during policy normalization.  After further review, staff analysis suggested that such accounts involved a number of operational, regulatory, and policy issues.  These issues raised questions about the possible effectiveness that would be dif-ficult to resolve in a timely fashion.  It was therefore de-cided that further work to implement such accounts would be shelved for now. The deputy manager followed with a discussion of the outcomes of recent tests of supplementary normaliza-tion tools, namely the Term Deposit Facility (TDF) and term and overnight reverse repurchase agreements (term RRPs and ON RRPs, respectively).  Regarding the TDF testing, the introduction of an early withdrawal option led to significant increases in the number of participating depository institutions and in take-up relative to earlier operations without this feature.  As expected, both par-ticipation and take-up in the operations continued to be sensitive to the offering rate and maximum individual award amount.  The Open Market Desk successfully conducted the first two of four preannounced term RRP operations extending across the end of the year to help address expected downward pressures on short-term rates.  Commentary from market participants suggested that these operations may help alleviate some of the vol-atility in short-term rates that would otherwise be ex-pected around the year-end.  Regarding the ON RRP testingduring which the offered rate was varied be-tween 3 and 10 basis pointsincreases in offered rates appeared to put some upward pressure on unsecured money market rates, as anticipated, and the offered rate continued to provide a soft floor for secured rates.  Changes in the spread between the rate paid on reserves and the ON RRP offered rate did not appear to affect the volume of activity in the federal funds market.  While the tests of ON RRPs had been informative, the staff suggested that additional testing could further improve understanding of how this supplementary tool could be used to achieve greater control of the federal funds rate during policy normalization.  Accordingly, participants ity to conduct the ON RRP exercise for 12 months be-yond the expiration of the current authorization on Jan-uary 30, 2015.  It was noted that a one-year extension to what had been a one-year testing program was a practical step and signaled nothing about either the timing of the start of policy normalization or how long an ON RRP facility might be needed.     Following the discussion of the extension of ON RRP test operations, the Committee unanimously approved the following resolution: (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a series of overnight reverse repurchase operations involving U.S. government securities for the purpose of fur-ther assessing the appropriate structure of such operations in supporting the implemen-tation of monetary policy during normaliza-tion.  The reverse repurchase operations au-thorized by this resolution shall be (i) con-ducted at an offering rate that may vary from zero to five basis points; (ii) for an overnight term or such longer term as is warranted to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions; (iii) subject to a per-counterparty limit of up to $30 billion per day; (iv) subject to an overall size limit of up to $300 billion per day; and (v) awarded to all submitters (A) at the specified offering rate if the sum of the bids received is less than or equal to the overall size limit, or (B) at the stop-out rate, determined by evaluating bids in ascending order by submitted rate up to the point at which the total quantity of bids equals the overall size limit, with all bids below this rate awarded in full at the stop-out rate and all bids at the stop-out rate awarded on a pro rata basis, if the sum of the counterparty offers re-ceived is greater than the overall size limit.  The Chair must approve any change in the of-fering rate within the range specified in (i) and any changes to the per-counterparty and over-all size limits subject to the limits specified in (iii) and (iv).  The System Open Market Ac-count manager will notify the FOMC in ad-vance about any changes to the offering rate, per-counterparty limit, or overall size limit ap-plied to operations.  These operations shall be authorized for one additional year beyond the previously authorized end datethat is,  By unanimous vote, the Committedomestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-riod. The Board meeting concluded at the end of the discus-sion of developments in financial markets and the Fed- Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the December 1617 meeting suggested that economic activity was increasing at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter and that labor market conditions had improved further.  Consumer longer-run objective of 2 percent, partly restrained by declining energy prices.  Market-based measures of in-flation compensation moved lower, but survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in Octo-ber and November at a faster pace than in the third quar-ter.  The unemployment rate edged down to 5.8 percent in October and remained at that level in November.  Both the labor force participation rate and the employ-ment-to-population ratio rose slightly, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons de-clined.  The rate of private-sector job openings stayed, on balance, at its recent elevated level in September and October, and the rates of hiring and of quits stepped up on net. Industrial production rose in October and November, led by strong increases in manufacturing output.  Au-pace of light mo-tor vehicle assemblies would move up somewhat in the first quarter, and broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were gen-erally consistent with solid gains in factory output over the near term. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-peared to be rising robustly in the fourth quarter.  The components of the nominal retail sales data used to con-struct estimates of PCE rose strongly in October and November, and light motor vehicle sales increased no-ticeably.  Key factors that influence household spending pointed toward further solid PCE growth.  Real dispos-able income rose further in October, energy prices con- worth likely increased as home values advanced, and consumer sentiment in early December from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers was at its highest level since before the most recent recession. The pace of activity in the housing sector generally        remained slow.  Both starts and permits of new single- family homes increased only a little, on balance, in Oc-tober and November.  Starts of multifamily units de-clined, on net, over the past two months.  Sales of new and existing homes rose modestly in October. Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-tellectual property appeared to be decelerating in the fourth quarter.  Nominal orders and shipments of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft declined in Oc-tober.  However, new orders for these capital goods re-mained above the level of shipments, and other forward-looking indicators, such as national and regional surveys of business conditions, were generally consistent with modest near-term gains in business equipment spending.  edged down in October after rising slightly in the third quarter.  Data for October and November pointed toward a de-cline in real federal government purchases in the fourth quarter after a surprisingly large third-quarter increase.  Real state and local government purchases appeared to be rising modestly in the fourth quarter as their payrolls and construction expenditures increased a little in recent months. The U.S. international trade deficit was little changed in October, as exports and imports both rose.  The gains in exports were concentrated in aircraft and other capital goods, and the increase in imports reflected a pickup in purchases of automotive products and computers.  But with the October deficit remaining wider than the monthly average in the third quarter, real net exports looked to be declining in the fourth quarter.  Both total U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, and core inflation, as measured by PCE prices excluding food and energy, were about      1½ percent over the 12 months ending in October; con-sumer energy prices declined, while consumer food prices rose more than overall prices.  Over the                  12 months ending in November, total inflation as meas-ured by the consumer price index (CPI) was 1¼ percent, partly reflecting the further decline in energy prices, while core CPI inflation was 1¾ percent.  Measures of expected long-run inflation from a variety of surveys, in-cluding the Michigan survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indi-cators, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable.  In contrast, market-based measures of inflation compensa-tion moved lower.   Labor compensation continued to increase only a little faster than consumer prices.  Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose about 2 percent over the year ending in the third quarter.  Similar  rates of increase were observed for the employment cost index over the same year-long period and for average hourly earnings for all employees over the 12 months ending in November. Overall growth in foreign real gross domestic product (GDP) remained subdued in the third quarter.  In the advanced foreign economies, real GDP contracted for a second consecutive quarter in Japan, rose only slightly in the euro area, but continued to expand moderately in Canada and the United Kingdom.  In the emerging mar-ket economies, economic growth slowed in Mexico in the third quarter and remained sluggish in Brazil; eco-nomic growth in China likely slowed moderately in the fourth quarter.  Oil prices continued to decline, likely re-flecting favorable supply developments as well as some weakening in global demand.  Inflation in the advanced foreign economies remained quite low during the inter-meeting period, partly because of the fall in oil prices.  Declining oil prices had a smaller effect on inflation in the emerging market economies, reflecting the greater prevalence of administered energy prices.   Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, market participants be-came a bit more optimistic about U.S. economic pro-spects while also responding to economic and policy de-velopments abroad.  The sharp decline in oil prices weighed on inflation compensation and left a mixed im-print on other asset markets.  On net, yields on longer-term Treasury securities fell, corporate bond spreads widened, equity prices were little changed, and the for-eign exchange value of the dollar appreciated. Economic data releases reinforced the views of market participants that the U.S. economic recovery continued to gain momentum.  In addition, investors appeared to read the October FOMC statement as suggesting a slightly less accommodative path for future monetary policy than they had previously expected. Results from the December Survey of Primary Dealers the first increase in the federal funds target range and the subsequent policy path were little changed from the Oc-tober survey.  The average probability distribution of the expected date of liftoff continued to imply that the most likely date would be around the middle of 2015, with the distribution having narrowed slightly compared with the previous survey.  Longer-term nominal Treasury yields declined signifi-cantly, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and on inflation swaps de-creased, reportedly reflecting, in part, the decline in oil prices and increased concerns about global economic growth. Broad U.S. equity price indexes were about unchanged over the intermeeting period.  Option-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&P 500 indexthe VIXrose sharply late in the period to levels close to those in mid-October.  Investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond spreads widened over the period.  Spreads on speculative-grade bonds for energy-related firms rose substantially because of the pronounced de-cline in oil prices. Business financing flows were robust over the inter-meeting period.  Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations was the strongest in more than a year.  Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding expanded noticeably in November, more than compensating for a slowdown in October.  Commercial and industrial loans tion, issuance of both leveraged loans and collateralized loan obligations were strong in October and November. Financing for commercial real estate (CRE) remained at a moderate pace in October and November, and issu-ance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) was strong.  According to the December Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, broker-dealers had eased somewhat all of the terms on which they finance CMBS for most-favored clients. Measures of residential mortgage lending conditions were little changed over the intermeeting period.  Credit conditions for mortgages remained tight for borrowers with less-than-pristine credit.  Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages declined, consistent with the moves in longer-term Treasury yields.  Refinancing activity was subdued. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets gener-ally stayed accommodative.  Auto and student loan bal-ances expanded robustly in October, and revolving credit balances increased at a moderate pace.  Issuance of consumer asset-backed securities was strong in the fourth quarter. Reflecting divergent economic and monetary policy  prospects in the United States and abroad, the dollar ap-preciated substantially against most currencies over the intermeeting period.  The dollar moved up significantly against the yen as the Bank of Japan expanded its asset purchase program as well as against the currencies of oil exporters as oil prices declined.  Over the period, market participants seemed to conclude that monetary policy in Europe was likely to be put on a more accommodative path, and 10-year yields in Germany and the United Kingdom declined further.  As German yields fell to new record lows, spreads of most euro-area peripheral bonds over those yields narrowed.  Changes in stock prices abroad were mixed, on net, over the intermeeting period: There were large increases in Japan and China along with large decreases in oil-exporting countries, such as Can-ada, Mexico, and Russia. Late in the intermeeting period, following the sharp fall in oil prices, the Russian ruble depreciated rapidly and substantially, prompting the Russian central bank, which had already raised its policy rate in early November, to raise the rate twice more in five days, with the most re-cent increase following an unscheduled policy meeting on December 15. Staff Economic Outlook In the staff forecast prepared for the December FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second half of 2014 was higher than in the projection for the October meet-ing, largely reflecting stronger-than-expected data for PCE.  Nevertheless, real GDP growth was anticipated to slow in the fourth quarter as both net exports and federal government purchasesimportant positive con-tributors to real GDP growth in the third quarterwere -term fore-cast for real GDP growth was revised up a little on net.  The projected path for oil prices was lower, and the tra-jectory for equity prices was a bit higher.  And although the projected path of the dollar was revised up, the staff revised down its estimate of how much the appreciation of the dollar since last summer would restrain projected growth in real GDP.  The staff continued to forecast that real GDP would expand at a faster pace in 2015 and 2016 than it had this year and that it would rise more quickly than potential output, supported by increases in consumer and business confidence and a pickup in for-eign economic growth, along with monetary policy that was assumed to remain highly accommodative for some time.  In 2017, real GDP growth was projected to begin slowing toward, but to remain above, the rate of poten-tial output growth as the normalization of monetary pol-icy was assumed to proceed.  The expansion in eco-nomic activity over the medium term was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to temporarily  f its longer-run natural rate.  vised down to reflect the further large energy price de-clines since the October FOMC meeting, which were an-ticipated to lead to a temporary decrease in the total PCE price index late this year and early next year.  inflation projection for the next few years was essentially unchanged; the staff continued to project that inflation would move up gradually toward, but run somewhat be--run objective of 2 percent.  Nevertheless, inflation was projected to reach the Com-longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, prices of energy and non-oil imports forecast to begin rising next year, and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to di-minish slowly.   The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-tion as similar to the average over the past 20 years.  The risks to the forecast for real GDP growth and inflation were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, reflecting fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.  At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemploy-ment rate as roughly balanced. PEconomic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2017 and over the longer run, conditional on each participants judgment of appropriate monetary policy.  The longer-run projections represent each par-would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is attached as an ad-dendum to these minutes. In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received over the intermeeting period as supporting their view that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace.  Labor market conditions improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate; partici-pants judged that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish.  Participants expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would in-crease at a pace sufficient to lead to further improve-ments in labor market indicators toward levels con- objective of maximum em-ployment.  Inflation was continuing to run below the -run objective, reflecting in part con-tinued reductions in oil prices and falling import prices.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation de-clined further, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.  Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually 2 percent objective as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipated.  The risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market were seen as nearly balanced.  Some participants suggested that the recent domestic economic data had increased their confidence in the outlook for growth go-ing forward.  Participants generally regarded the net ef-fect of the recent decline in energy prices as likely to be positive for economic activity and employment.  How-ever, many of them thought that a further deterioration in the foreign economic situation could result in slower domestic economic growth than they currently expected.  Household spending continued to advance over the in-termeeting period, and reports from contacts in several parts of the country indicated that recent retail or auto sales had been robust.  Many participants pointed to rel-atively high levels of consumer confidence as signaling near-term strength in discretionary consumer spending, and most participants judged that the recent significant decline in energy prices would provide a boost to con-sumer spending.  Participants also cited solid gains in payroll employment, low interest rates, and the decline in levels of household debt relative to income as factors that were expected to support continued growth in con-sumer spending.  In contrast, residential construction continued to be slow, and recent readings on single- family building permits suggested that this sluggishness was likely to continue in the short run. Industry contacts pointed to generally solid business conditions, with businesses in many parts of the country expressing some optimism about prospects for further improvement in 2015.  Manufacturing activity was strong, as indicated by the index of industrial production and a variety of regional reports.  Information from some regions pointed to a pickup in capital investment, although the continued decline in oil prices led business  contacts to expect a slowdown in drilling activity and, if prices remain low, reduced capital investment in the oil and gas industries.  In the agricultural sector, the robust fall harvest reportedly lowered crop prices; operating margins for food processing and farm equipment busi-nesses have been narrowing, putting stress on some pro-ducers.  In their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, par-ticipants noted that the implications of the drop in crude oil prices would differ across regions, especially if the price declines affected inflation expectations and finan-cial markets; a few participants said that the effect on overseas employment and output as a whole was likely to be positive.  While some participants had lowered their assessments of the prospects for global economic growth, several noted that the likelihood of further re-sponses by policymakers abroad had increased.  Several participants indicated that they expected slower eco-nomic growth abroad to negatively affect the U.S. econ-omy, principally through lower net exports, but the net effect of lower oil prices on U.S. economic activity was anticipated to be positive. Participants saw broad-based improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period, includ-ing solid gains in payroll employment, a slight reduction in the unemployment rate, and increases in the rates of hiring and quits.  Positive signals were also seen in the decline in the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons and in the increase in the labor force participation rate.  These favorable trends notwithstand-ing, the levels of these measures suggested to some par-ticipants that there remained more labor market slack than was indicated by the unemployment rate alone.  However, a few others continued to view the unemploy-ment rate as a reliable indicator of overall labor market conditions and saw a narrower degree of labor underuti-lization remaining.  Although a few participants sug-gested that the recent uptick in the employment cost in-dex or average hourly earnings could be a tentative sign of an upturn in wage growth, most participants saw no clear evidence of a broad-based acceleration in wages.  A couple of participants, however, pointing to the weak statistical relationship between wage inflation and labor market conditions, suggested that the pace of wage in-flation was providing relatively little information about the degree of labor underutilization.   Participants generally anticipated that inflation was likely to decline further in the near term, reflecting the reduc-tion in oil prices and the effects of the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on import prices.  Most par-ticipants saw these influences as temporary and thus continued to expect inflation to move back gradually to the Colonger-run objective as the labor market improved further in an environment of well-anchored inflation expectations.  Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable, although market-based measures of inflation compensation over the next five years, as well as over the five-year period beginning five years ahead, moved down further over the intermeeting period.  Participants discussed various explanations for the decline in market-based measures, including a fall in expected future infla-tion, reductions in inflation risk premiums, and higher liquidity and other premiums that might be influencing the prices of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and inflation derivatives.  Model-based decompositions of inflation compensation seemed to support the message from surveys that longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable, although it was observed that these re-sults were sensitive to the assumptions underlying the particular models used.  It was noted that even if the de-clines in inflation compensation reflected lower inflation risk premiums rather than a reduction in expected infla-tion, policymakers might still want to take them into ac-count because such changes could reflect increased con-cerns on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak eco-nomic activity.  In the end, participants generally agreed that it would take more time and analysis to draw defin-itive conclusions regarding the recent behavior of infla-tion compensation. In their discussion of financial market developments, participants observed that movements in asset prices over the intermeeting period appeared to have been im-portantly influenced by concerns about prospects for foreign economic growth and by associated expectations of monetary policy actions in Europe and Japan.  A cou-ple of participants remarked on the apparent disparity between market-based measures of expected future U.S. short-term interest rates and projections for short-term rates based on surveys or based on the median of federal funds rate projections in the SEP.  One participant noted that very low term premiums in market-based measures might explain at least some portion of this gap.  Another possibility was that market-based measures might be as-signing considerable weight to less favorable outcomes for the U.S. economy in which the federal funds rate would remain low for quite some time or fall back to very low levels in the future, whereas the projections in the SEP report the paths for the federal funds rate that  participants see as appropriate given their views of the most likely evolution of inflation and real activity.   Participants discussed a number of risks to the economic outlook.  Many participants regarded the international situation as an important source of downside risks to do-mestic real activity and employment, particularly if de-clines in oil prices and the persistence of weak economic growth abroad had a substantial negative effect on global financial markets or if foreign policy responses were in-sufficient.  However, the downside risks were seen as nearly balanced by risks to the upside.  Several partici-pants, pointing to indicators of consumer and business confidence as well as to the solid record of payroll em-ployment gains in 2014, suggested that the real economy may end up showing more momentum than anticipated, while a few others thought that the boost to domestic spending coming from lower energy prices could turn out to be quite large.  With regard to inflation, a number of participants saw a risk that it could run persistently below their 2 percent objective, with some expressing concern that such an outcome could undermine the jective.  Some participants were worried that the recent substantial fall in energy prices could lead to a reduction in longer-term inflation expectations, while others were concerned that the decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation might reflect, in part, that such a decline had already begun.  However, a couple of others noted that if the unemployment rate continued to de-cline quickly, wage and price inflation could rise more than generally anticipated. In their discussion of communications regarding the path of the federal funds rate over the medium term, most participants concluded that updating the Commit-in light of the conclusion of the asset purchase program in October and the further progress that the economy had made to-  Most participants agreed that it would be useful to state that the Commit-tee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy; they noted that such lan-guage would provide more flexibility to adjust policy in response to incoming information than the previous lan-guage, which had tied the beginning of normalization to the end of the asset purchase program.  This approach was seen as consistentment of the economic outlook at the current meeting, statement.  Most partici-pants thought the reference to patience indicated that the Committee was unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least the next couple of meetings.  Some participants regarded the revised language as risking an unwarranted concentration of market expectations for the timing of the initial increase in the federal funds rate target on a narrow range of dates around mid-2015, and as not adequately allowing for the possibility that eco-nomic conditions might evolve in a way that could call for either an earlier or a later liftoff date.  A few partici-pants suggested that the statement should focus on the economic conditions that would likely accompany the decision to raise rates.  Participants generally stressed the need to communicate that the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate would depend on the incoming data and their implications for ment of progress toward its objectives of maximum em-ployment and inflation of 2 percent.  With lower energy prices and the stronger dollar likely to keep inflation be-low target for some time, it was noted that the Commit-tee might begin normalization at a time when core infla-tion was near current levels, although in that circum-stance participants would want to be reasonably confi-dent that inflation will move back toward 2 percent over time.  A few participants spoke of the importance of explaining to the public how economic and financial conditions e appropriate path for the federal funds rate after normal-ization begins.  It was noted that to the extent that such guidance can be effectively communicated, the precise date of liftoff becomes less important for economic out-comes.  In this regard, some participants emphasized that policy will still be highly accommodative for a time after the first increase in the federal funds rate target, given the difference between the current setting of the federal funds rate target range and the of the longer-run normal rate as well as the Federal Re--term securities.   Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in October indicated that economic ac-tivity was expanding at a moderate pace.  Labor market conditions had improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate; taken as a whole, labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish.  Household spending was rising moderately and business fixed in-vestment was advancing, while the recovery in the hous-ing sector remained slow.  Inflation had continued to run -run objective, in part re-flecting declines in energy prices.  Market-based  measures of inflation compensation had declined some-what further, but survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable.  The Com-mittee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee also expected that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory ef-fects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate. In their discussion of language for the postmeeting state-ment, members generally agreed that they should acknowledge the broad improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period as well as their judgment that labor market slack continued to diminish.  In addition, they decided that the statement should note that the low level of inflation seen of late partly reflected the recent decline in energy prices.  The Committee modified the previous statement language to make clear that it expects that inflation will rise gradually toward       2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other fac-tors dissipate.  Given the uncertainties about the outlook for inflation, members decided that it would be appro-priate to indicate that the Committee continues to mon-itor inflation developments closely. The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm the indication in the statement that the Committees decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  Most members agreed to update the  with language indicating that it judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.  In order to avoid the misinterpretation that this new wording the statement included a sentence indicating that the Committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program in October, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committees 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Two members thought that this forward guidance did not take sufficient account of the progress that had been made while one wanted to strengthen the forward guidance in order to underscore the Committees commitment to its 2 percent inflation objective.  Members agreed that their policy decisions would remain data dependent, and they continued to include wording in the statement noting that if incoming information indicates faster progress objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely occur sooner than currently anticipated, and, similarly, that if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range would likely occur later than currently anticipated.  The Committee decided to maintain its policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committees holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.  Finally, the Committee also decided to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to       ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the  -backed securities transactions.  The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing sheet that could affect the attainment over maximum employment and price stability. The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.  Labor market conditions improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate.  On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish.  Household spending is rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow.  Inflation has continued -run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.  The Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward          2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progressboth realized and expectedtoward its objectives of maximum employment and         2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.  The Committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program in October, especially if projected inflation continues to run below -run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.  However, if incoming information indicates faster employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.  Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may,  for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee  Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. Dudley, Lael Brainard, Stanley Fischer, Loretta J. Mester, Jerome H. Powell, and Daniel K. Tarullo. Voting against this action:  Richard W. Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota, and Charles I. Plosser. Mr. Fisher agreed that the Committee should be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary pol-icy.  He dissented because he saw the improvement in the U.S. economic outlook since October as indicating that it likely will be appropriate to increase the federal funds rate sooner than the Committment envisions.  Mr. Kocherlakota dissented because he believed that the ongoing below-target inflation and falling market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations.  In his inflation target was at risk, calling for a more accommo-dative policy stance. Mr. Plosser dissented for two reasons.  He believed that dependent and not focus on time.  In his view, the improvement in economic conditions that has occurred over the course of the year was greater than anticipated, and he believed that the statement should communicate that there is a measurable probability that liftoff may oc-cur in the first quarter of next year, even if the most likely scenario is for normalization to begin around midyear.  He further believed that waiting too long to raise rates could lead to the need for more-aggressive policy in the future, which could potentially lead to unnecessary vol-atility and instability.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on TuesdayWednesday, January 2728, 2015.  The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m. on December 17, 2014. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on November 18, 2014, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on October 2829, 2014.    _____________________________ William B. English Secretary  Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-tee (FOMC) meeting held on December 1617, 2014, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unem-ployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2014 to 2017 and over the longer run.1  ased on information available at the time of the meeting plus his or her as-sessment of appropriate monetary policy and assump-tions about the factors likely to affect economic out-comes.

Participants were asked to provide, in their contributions to the Summary of Economic Projections, either the midpoint of the target range for the federal funds rate for any period when a range was anticipated or the target level for the federal funds rate, as appropriate.  In the lower panel of figure 2, these values have been rounded to the nearest  percentage point. Overall, FOMC participants expected that, after a slow-down in the first half of 2014, economic growth under appropriate policy would be faster in the second half of 2014 and over 2015 and 2016 than their estimates of the -run normal growth rate.  On bal-ance, participants then saw economic growth moving back toward their assessments of its longer-run pace in 2017 (table 1 and figure 1).  Most participants projected that the unemployment rate will continue to decline in 2015 and 2016, and all participants projected that the un-employment rate will be at or below their individual judgments of its longer-run normal level by the end of 2016.  All participants projected that inflation, as meas-ured by the four-quarter change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would rise gradually, on balance, over the next few years.  Most par-ticipants saw inflation approaching the        2 percent longer-run objective in 2016 and 2017.  While a few participants projected that inflation would rise temporarily above 2 percent during the forecast period, many others expected inflation to remain low through 2017. Participants judged that it would be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate over the projection period as labor market indicators and in-flation move back toward values the Committee judges consistent with the attainment of its mandated objec-tives of maximum employment and stable prices.

Most participants viewed the uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic growth and the unemploy-ment rate as broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years.  Most participants also judged the level of uncertainty about inflation to be broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years, although a few partic-ipants viewed it as higher.  In addition, most participants continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic growth and for the unemployment rate as broadly bal-anced.  A majority saw the risks to inflation as broadly balanced; however, a number of participants saw the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside, while one judged these risks as tilted to the upside. The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants projected that, conditional on their individ-ual assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) would pick up from its low level in the first half of 2014 and run above their estimates of its longer-run normal rate in the second half of 2014 and over 2015 and 2016.  Par-ticipants pointed to a number of factors that they ex-pected would contribute to stronger real output growth, including improving labor market conditions, lower en-ergy prices, rising household net worth, diminishing re-straint from fiscal policy, and highly accommodative monetary policy.  On balance, participants saw real GDP growth moving back toward, but remaining at or some-what above, its longer-run rate in 2017 as monetary pol-icy adjusts appropriately. s to their forecasts for real GDP growth relative to their projections for the September meeting were modest.  However, all partici-pants revised up their projections of real GDP growth somewhat for 2014, with a number of them noting that recent data releases regarding real economic activity had been stronger than anticipated.  The central tendencies current projections for real GDP growth were 2.3 to 2.4 percent in 2014, 2.6 to 3.0 percent in 2015, 2.5 to 3.0 percent in 2016, and 2.3 to 2.5 percent in 2017.  The central tendency of the projections of real GDP growth over the longer run was 2.0 to 2.3 percent, unchanged from September. All participants projected that the unemployment rate will decline, on balance, through 2016, and all partici-pants projected that, by the end of that year, the unem-ployment rate will be at or below their individual judg-ments of its longer-run normal level.  The central ment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 5.8 per-cent in 2014, 5.2 to 5.3 percent in 2015, 5.0 to 5.2 percent in 2016, and 4.9 to 5.3 percent in 2017.  Almost all par-shifted down slightly through 2015 compared with their projections in September; many participants noted that recent data pointing to improving labor market condi-tions were an important factor underlying the downward revisions in their unemployment rate forecasts.  The cen--run normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of fur-ther shocks to the economy was unchanged at 5.2 to    5.5 percent; the range of these estimates was 5.0 to        5.8 percent, down slightly from 5.0 to 6.0 percent in Sep-tember. Figures 3.A and 3.B show that participants held a range of views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate through 2017.  Some of the diversity of views reflected their individual assess-ments of the effects of lower oil prices on consumer spending and business investment, of the rate at which the forces that have been restraining the pace of the eco-nomic recovery would continue to abate, of the trajec-tory for growth in consumption as labor market slack diminishes, and of the appropriate path of monetary pol-icy.  Relative to September, the dispersion of partici-was little changed from 2015 to 2017, while for the unemploy-ment rate, the dispersion was a bit narrower.  The Outlook for Inflation Compared with September, the central tendencies of sumption of appropriate monetary policy moved down for 2014 and 2015 but were largely unchanged for 2016 and 2017.  In commenting on the changes to their pro-jections, many participants indicated that the significant decline in energy prices and the appreciation of the dol-lar likely will put temporary downward pressure on inflation.  The central tendencies of participantsPCE inflation moved down somewhat for 2015 but were mostly unchanged in other years.  Almost all participants projected that PCE inflation would rise gradually, on balance, over the period from 2015 to 2017, reaching a  few participants expected PCE inflation to rise slightly  Figure2.OverviewofFOMCparticipantsassessmentsofappropriatemonetarypolicy152Appropriate timing of policy firmingNumber of participants1234567891011121314151620152016PercentAppropriate pace of policy firming: Midpoint of target range or target level for the federal funds rate00.511.522.533.544.552014201520162017Longer runNote:Intheupperpanel,theheightofeachbardenotesthenumberofFOMCparticipantswhojudgethat,underappropriatemonetarypolicy,the rstincreaseinthetargetrangeforthefederalfundsratefromitscurrentrangeof0to1/4percentwilloccurinthespeci edcalendaryear.InSeptember2014,thenumbersofFOMCparticipantswhojudgedthatthe rstincreaseinthetargetfederalfundsratewouldoccurin2014,2015,and2016were,respectively,1,14,and2.Inthelowerpanel,eachshadedcircleindicatesthevalue(roundedtothenearest1/8percentagepoint)ofanindividualparticipantsjudgmentofthemidpointoftheappropriatetargetrangeforthefederalfundsrateortheappropriatetargetlevelforthefederalfundsrateattheendofthespeci edcalendaryearoroverthelongerrun.

The central tenden-cies for PCE inflation were 1.2 to 1.3 percent in 2014, 1.0 to 1.6 percent in 2015, 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016, and 1.8 to 2.0 percent in 2017.  The central tendencies of the forecasts for core inflation were higher than those for the headline measure in 2014 and 2015, reflecting the ef-fects of lower oil prices.  The central tendencies of the two measures were equal in 2016 and in 2017.  Factors cited by participants as likely to contribute to a gradual rise of inflation -run ob-jective of 2 percent included stable longer-term inflation expectations, steadily diminishing resource slack, a pickup in wage growth, waning effects of declines in oil prices, and still-accommodative monetary policy.

The ranges for core inflation narrowed in 2014 and 2015.  In other years of the projection, the ranges of the inflation projections were relatively little changed.  The range for both measures in 2017 continued to show a 2 percent longer-run objective by that time. Appropriate Monetary Policy Participants judged that it would be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate over the projection period as labor market indicators and in-flation move back toward values the Committee judges consistent with the attainment of its mandated objec-tives of maximum employment and price stability.  As shown in figure 2, all but two participants anticipated that it would be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate during 2015.  However, most projected that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate would remain considerably below its longer-run normal level through 2016.  Most participants ex-pected the appropriate level of the federal funds rate would be near, or already would have reached, their in-dividual view of its longer-run normal level by the end of 2017. All participants projected that the unemployment rate would be at or below 5.5 percent at the end of the year in which they judged the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted, and all but one anticipated that inflation would be at or be-e end of that year.  Most participants projected that the unemploy-ment rate would be at or somewhat above their estimates of its longer-run normal level at that time. judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate, conditional on their assessments of the economic outlook, at the end of each calendar year from 2014 to 2017 and over the longer run.  All partici-pants judged that economic conditions would warrant maintaining the current exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate into 2015.  The median values of the federal funds rate at the end of 2015 and 2016 fell           25 basis points and 38 basis points relative to September, to 1.13 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively, while the mean values fell 15 basis points for both years, to        1.13 percent in 2015 and 2.54 percent in 2016.  The dis-persion of the projections for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate was narrower in 2014 and 2015 and was little changed in 2016 and 2017.  Most partici-pants judged that it would be appropriate to set the fed-eral funds rate at or near its longer-run normal level in 2017, although a number of them projected that the fed-eral funds rate would still need to be set appreciably be-low its longer-run normal level at that time and one an-ticipated that it would be appropriate to target a level noticeably above its longer-run normal level.  Partici-pants provided a number of reasons why they thought it would be appropriate for the federal funds rate to remain below its longer-run normal level for some time after in-flation and the unemployment rate were near mandate-consistent levels.  These reasons included an assessment that the headwinds that have been holding back the re-covery will continue to exert some restraint on economic activity at that time, that residual slack in the labor mar-ket will still be evident in other measures of labor utili-zation, and that the risks to the economic outlook are asymmetric as a result of the constraints on monetary policy associated with the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate. As in September, estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate ranged from 3.25 to 4.25 percent.  All participants judged that inflation over the longer run would be equal to the Committee2 percent, implying that their individual judgments re-garding the appropriate longer-run level of the real fed-eral funds rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy ranged from 1.25 to 2.25 percent.

Some participants also mentioned the prescrip-tions of various monetary policy rules as factors they considered in judging the appropriate path for the fed-eral funds rate. Uncertainty and Risks Nearly all participants continued to judge the levels of uncertainty attending their projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norms during the previous 20 years (figure 4).  Most participants continued to see the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as broadly balanced.  A few partic-ipants viewed the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside; one viewed the risks as weighted to the upside.  Those participants who viewed the risks as weighted to the downside cited, for example, concern about the limited ability of monetary policy at the effec-tive lower bound to respond to further negative shocks to the economy or about the trajectory for economic growth abroad.  As in September, nearly all participants judged the risks to the outlook for the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced. As in September, participants generally agreed that the levels of uncertainty associated with their inflation fore-casts were broadly similar to historical norms, and most  Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total con-sumer price inflation over the period from 1994 through 2013.  discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess tions. saw the risks to those projections as broadly balanced.  A number of participants, however, viewed the risks to their inflation forecasts as tilted to the downside; the rea-sons discussed included the possibility that the recent low levels of inflation could prove more persistent than anticipated; the possibility that the upward pull on prices from inflation expectations might be weaker than as-sumed; or the judgment that, in current circumstances, it would be difficult for the Committee to respond ef-fectively to low-inflation outcomes.  Conversely, one participant saw upside risks to inflation, citing uncer-withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation.     Table 2.

Forecast Uncertainty    The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policy-makers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.  Considerable uncer-tainty attends these projections, however.  The economic and statistical models and relation-ships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen develop-ments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely eco-nomic outcome as embodied in their projec-tions, but also the range of alternative possibil-ities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they oc-cur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.  The projec-tion error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively,        3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-tending those projections is similar to that ex-perienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would ex-pand within a range of 2.1 to 3.9 percent in the  current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third and fourth years.  The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2 percent in the current year, 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to 3.0 per-cent in the third and fourth years. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast un-certainty in the past, as shown in table 2.  Partic-ipants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the up-side, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, participants judge whether each variable is more likely to be above or below their projections of the most likely out-come.  These judgments about the uncertainty tions are distinct from the diversity of partici-Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks associated with a particular projection rather than with divergences across a number of differ-ent projections. As with real activity and inflation, the out-look for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This un-certainty arises primarily because each partici-pants assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward.
