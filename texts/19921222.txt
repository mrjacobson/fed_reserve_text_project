By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period November 17, 1992, through December 21, 1992, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity has been rising appreciably in the current quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment has increased slightly since September, and the average workweek has moved higher. The civilian unemployment rate fell further in November to 7.2 percent. Industrial production posted solid gains in October and November. Retail sales increased.sharply in October and rose further in November. Residential construction activity appears to have increased from the thirdquarter pace. Indicators of business fixed investment have been mixed recently, but on balance they suggest further growth. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed somewhat in October from its average rate in the third quarter. Recent data on wages and prices suggest on balance a possible slowing in the trend toward lower inflation. Changes in short-term interest rates have been mixed since the Committee meeting on November 17 while bond yields have edged lower. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was essentially unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period.  Over the course of recent months, M2 has expanded at a moderate pace, while M3 has continued to expand at a very slow rate. More recently, both aggregates have weakened somewhat. Both appear to have grown at rates a little below the lower ends of the ranges established by the Committee for the year.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting on June 30-July 1 reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and 1 to 5 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1992. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist in the second half of the year. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was maintained at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for the year. For 1993, the Committee on a tentative basis set the same ranges as in 1992 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with M2 growing at a rate of around 1-1/2 percent and M3 about unchanged in the period from November through March. -4It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, February 2-3, 1993.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
