The Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations in  Federal-Agency Issues remained suspended.  AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS (As amended effective January 30, 2018)  OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS   1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the  Com-mittee ) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to execute open market trans-actions (the  Selected Bank ), to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted  by the Committee: A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin-cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec-tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act ( Eligible Secu-rities ) for the System Open Market Account ( SOMA ): i. As an outright operation with securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Selected Bank: on a same-day or deferred de-livery basis (including such transactions as are com-monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) at market prices; or ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se-curities subject to an agreement to resell ( repo transactions ) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub-ject to an agreement to repurchase ( reverse repo transactions ) for a term of 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual counterparties; B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma-ture without replacement;  C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of the United States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; and D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by that agency.  SECURITIES LENDING  2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se-lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu-rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis (except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi-ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). A. Such securities lending must be: i. At rates determined by competitive bidding; ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program; iii. Subject to reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that may be auctioned; and iv. Subject to reasonable limitations on the amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower may borrow.  B. The Selected Bank may: i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis-cretion, could facilitate a bidder's ability to control a single issue;  ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral for any loan of securities authorized in this para-graph 2; and iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a loan of agency securities authorized in this para-graph 2.  OPERATIONAL READINESS TESTING  3. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to undertake transactions of the type described in para-graphs 1 and 2 from time to time for the purpose of test-ing operational readiness, subject to the following limi-tations: A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 3 shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit-tee; B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au-thorized in this paragraph 3 that are of the type de-scribed in paragraph 1.A.i shall not exceed $5 billion per calendar year; and C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de-scribed in paragraphs 1.A.ii and 2 shall not exceed $5 billion at any given time.  TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS  4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments or other authorized services for foreign central bank and international accounts main-tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the  Foreign Ac-counts ) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec-tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the Foreign Accounts, the  Customer Accounts ), the Com-mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on terms comparable to those available in the open market:  A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to undertake reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in the SOMA with the Customer Accounts for a term of 65 business days or less; and B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus-tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, when appropriate and subject to all other necessary authorization and approvals, to:  i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi-ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus-tomer Accounts; and  ii. Undertake intra-day repo transactions in Eligi-ble Securities with Foreign Accounts. Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts un-der the provisions of this paragraph 4 may provide for a service fee when appropriate.  Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts are also subject to the authori-zation or approval of other entities, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, when involving accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States, the United States Department of the Treasury.  ADDITIONAL MATTERS  5. The Committee authorizes the Chairman of the Committee, in fostering the Committee's objectives dur-ing any period between meetings of the Committee, to instruct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Com-mittee to: A. Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that may result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the SOMA; or  B. Undertake transactions with respect to Eligible Securities in order to appropriately address temporary disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature in U.S. dollar funding markets. Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the Committee's discussion and decision about the stance of policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee's long-run objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments since the most recent meet-ing of the Committee.  The Chairman, whenever feasi-ble, will consult with the Committee before making any instruction under this paragraph 5.  The Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm without revision the Authorization for Foreign Currency Opera-tions and the Foreign Currency Directive as shown be-low.  AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS (As reaffirmed effective January 30, 2018) IN GENERAL 1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the  Com-mittee ) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank selected by  the Committee (the  Selected Bank ) to execute open market transactions for the System Open Market Ac-count as provided in this Authorization, to the extent necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Committee: A. To purchase and sell foreign currencies (also known as cable transfers) at home and abroad in the open market, including with the United States Treas-ury, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with other entities in the open market.  This authorization to purchase and sell foreign currencies encompasses purchases and sales through standalone spot or forward transactions and through foreign exchange swap transactions.  For purposes of this Authorization, foreign exchange swap transactions are:  swap transactions with the United States Treasury (also known as warehousing transactions), swap transactions with other central banks under reciprocal currency arrangements, swap transactions with other central banks under standing dollar liquidity and foreign currency liquidity swap ar-rangements, and swap transactions with other entities in the open market. B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding for-ward contracts to receive or to deliver, foreign curren-cies. 2. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, be conducted:   A. In a manner consistent with the obligations re-garding exchange arrangements under Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the International Mone-tary Fund (IMF).1 B. In close and continuous cooperation and consul-tation, as appropriate, with the United States Treasury.  C. In consultation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary authorities, foreign central banks, and inter-national monetary institutions. D. At prevailing market rates.  STANDALONE SPOT AND FORWARD  TRANSACTIONS  3. For any operation that involves standalone spot or forward transactions in foreign currencies:  A. Approval of such operation is required as fol-lows: i. The Committee must direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the operation if it would result in the overall volume of standalone spot and for-ward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined in paragraph 3.C of this Authorization, exceeding $5 billion since the close of the most recent regular meeting of the Committee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee (the  Subcommittee ) must direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the opera-tion if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the Committee is not feasible in the time avail-able.  ii. The Committee authorizes the Subcommittee to direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the operation if it would result in the overall volume of standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined in paragraph 3.C of this Au-thorization, totaling $5 billion or less since the close of the most recent regular meeting of the Commit-tee.   B. Such an operation also shall be:   i. Generally directed at countering disorderly market conditions; or ii. Undertaken to adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies; or iii. Conducted for such other purposes as may be determined by the Committee. C. For purposes of this Authorization, the overall volume of standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregard-ing signs) of the dollar values of individual foreign cur-rencies purchased and sold, valued at the time of the transaction.  WAREHOUSING  4. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank, with the prior approval of the Subcommittee and at the re-quest of the United States Treasury, to conduct swap transactions with the United States Exchange Stabiliza-tion Fund established by section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 under agreements in which the Selected Bank purchases foreign currencies from the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund repurchases the foreign currencies from the Selected Bank at a later date (such purchases and sales also known as warehousing).   RECIPROCAL CURRENCY ARRANGEMENTS, AND STANDING DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCY LIQUIDITY SWAPS  5. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements established under the North American Framework Agreement, standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and stand- ing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements as pro-vided in this Authorization and to the extent necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Com-mittee.   A. For reciprocal currency arrangements all draw-ings must be approved in advance by the Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee be-lieves that consultation with the Committee is not fea-sible in the time available). B. For standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements all drawings must be approved in advance by the Chairman.  The Chairman may approve a schedule of potential drawings, and may delegate to the manager, System Open Market Account, the authority to ap-prove individual drawings that occur according to the schedule approved by the Chairman.   C. For standing foreign currency liquidity swap ar-rangements all drawings must be approved in advance by the Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the Committee is not feasible in the time available). D. Operations involving standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements and standing foreign currency li-quidity swap arrangements shall generally be directed at countering strains in financial markets in the United States or abroad, or reducing the risk that they could emerge, so as to mitigate their effects on economic and financial conditions in the United States. E. For reciprocal currency arrangements, standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and standing for-eign currency liquidity swap arrangements: i. All arrangements are subject to annual review and approval by the Committee; ii.  Any new arrangements must be approved by the Committee; and iii. Any changes in the terms of existing arrange-ments must be approved in advance by the Chair-man.  The Chairman shall keep the Committee in-formed of any changes in terms, and the terms shall be consistent with principles discussed with and guidance provided by the Committee.  OTHER OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN  CURRENCIES  6. Any other operations in foreign currencies for which governance is not otherwise specified in this Au-thorization (such as foreign exchange swap transactions with private-sector counterparties) must be authorized and directed in advance by the Committee.  FOREIGN CURRENCY HOLDINGS  7. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to hold foreign currencies for the System Open Market Ac-count in accounts maintained at foreign central banks, the Bank for International Settlements, and such other foreign institutions as approved by the Board of Gover-nors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, to the extent necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Committee. A. The Selected Bank shall manage all holdings of foreign currencies for the System Open Market Ac-count:   i. Primarily, to ensure sufficient liquidity to ena-ble the Selected Bank to conduct foreign currency operations as directed by the Committee; ii. Secondarily, to maintain a high degree of safety; iii. Subject to paragraphs 7.A.i and 7.A.ii, to pro-vide the highest rate of return possible in each cur-rency; and iv. To achieve such other objectives as may be au-thorized by the Committee. B. The Selected Bank may manage such foreign cur-rency holdings by:  i. Purchasing and selling obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a foreign government or agency thereof ( Permitted Foreign Securities ) through outright purchases and sales; ii. Purchasing Permitted Foreign Securities under agreements for repurchase of such Permitted For-eign Securities and selling such securities under agreements for the resale of such securities; and iii. Managing balances in various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by the Board of Governors under Regulation N.  C. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may provide additional instructions to the Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign curren-cies.  ADDITIONAL MATTERS  8. The Committee authorizes the Chairman:   A. With the prior approval of the Committee, to en-ter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the United States Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency opera-tions between the System and the United States Treas-ury;  B. To advise the Secretary of the United States Treasury concerning System foreign currency opera-tions, and to consult with the Secretary on policy mat-ters relating to foreign currency operations;  C. To designate Federal Reserve System persons au-thorized to communicate with the United States Treasury concerning System Open Market Account foreign currency operations; and D. From time to time, to transmit appropriate re-ports and information to the National Advisory Coun-cil on International Monetary and Financial Policies. 9. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to undertake transactions of the type described in this Au-thorization, and foreign exchange and investment transactions that it may be otherwise authorized to undertake, from time to time for the purpose of testing operational readiness.  The aggregate amount of such transactions shall not exceed $2.5 billion per calendar year.  These transactions shall be conducted with prior notice to the Committee.  10. All Federal Reserve banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Open Market Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors' Statement of Procedure with Re-spect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944. 11. Any authority of the Subcommittee pursuant to this Authorization may be exercised by the Chairman if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Sub-committee is not feasible in the time available. The Chairman shall promptly report to the Subcommittee any action approved by the Chairman pursuant to this paragraph. 12. The Committee authorizes the Chairman, in excep-tional circumstances where it would not be feasible to convene the Committee, to foster the Committee's ob-jectives by instructing the Selected Bank to engage in foreign currency operations not otherwise authorized pursuant to this Authorization.  Any such action shall be made in the context of the Committee's discussion and decisions regarding foreign currency operations.  The Chairman, whenever feasible, will consult with the Com-mittee before making any instruction under this para-graph. __________________________  1 In general, as specified in Article IV, each member of the IMF undertakes to collaborate with the IMF and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates.  These obligations include seeking to direct the member's eco-nomic and financial policies toward the objective of fos-tering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability.  These obligations also include avoiding manip-ulating exchange rates or the international monetary sys-tem in such a way that would impede effective balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competitive advantage over other members.  FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE (As reaffirmed effective January 30, 2018)  1. The Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee (the  Selected Bank ) to ex-ecute open market transactions, for the System Open Market Account, in accordance with the provisions of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations (the  Authorization ) and subject to the limits in this Di-rective. 2. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to exe-cute warehousing transactions, if so requested by the United States Treasury and if approved by the Foreign Currency Subcommittee (the  Subcommittee ), subject to the limitation that the outstanding balance of United States dollars provided to the United States Treasury as a result of these transactions not at any time exceed $5 billion. 3. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to main-tain, for the System Open Market Account:  A. Reciprocal currency arrangements with the fol-lowing foreign central banks:  Foreign central bank Maximum amount     (millions of dollars     or equivalent)  Bank of Canada  2,000 Bank of Mexico  3,000  B. Standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements with the following foreign central banks:  Bank of Canada Bank of England Bank of Japan European Central Bank Swiss National Bank  C. Standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrange-ments with the following foreign central banks:  Bank of Canada Bank of England  Bank of Japan European Central Bank Swiss National Bank  4. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to hold and to invest foreign currencies in the portfolio in ac-cordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of the Au-thorization. 5. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to report to the Committee, at each regular meeting of the Com-mittee, on transactions undertaken pursuant to para-graphs 1 and 6 of the Authorization.  The Selected Bank is also directed to provide quarterly reports to the Com-mittee regarding the management of the foreign cur-rency holdings pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Authori-zation. 6. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to con-duct testing of transactions for the purpose of opera-tional readiness in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 of the Authorization. By unanimous vote, the Committee revised its Program for Security of FOMC Information with a set of tech-nical changes to update references to other documents.  In the Committee's annual reconsideration of the State-ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat-egy, participants agreed that only a minor revision was required at this meeting, which was to update the refer-ence to the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment from 4.8 percent to 4.6 percent.  All participants supported the statement with the revision, and the Committee voted unanimously to approve the updated statement.  STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY (As amended effective January 30, 2018)  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, sta-ble prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci-sions to the public as clearly as possible.  Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncer-tainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan-cial disturbances.  Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag.  Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its as-sessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.  The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de-termined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.  The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expendi-tures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate.  The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persis-tently above or below this objective.  Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of signifi-cant economic disturbances.  The maximum level of em-ployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar-ket.  These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable.  Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; ra-ther, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncer-tain and subject to revision.  The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments.  Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unem-ployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections.  For ex-ample, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.6 percent.  In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's as-sessments of its maximum level.  These objectives are generally complementary.  However, under circum-stances in which the Committee judges that the objec-tives are not complementary, it follows a balanced ap-proach in promoting them, taking into account the mag-nitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.  The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual or-ganizational meeting each January.  Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-ket Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in do-mestic and global financial markets over the intermeet-ing period.   Financial conditions eased further over re-cent weeks with market participants pointing to increas-ing appetites for risk and perceptions of diminished downside risks as factors buoying market sentiment.  In this environment, yields on safe assets such as U.S. Treasury securities moved up some while corporate risk spreads narrowed and equity prices recorded further sig-nificant gains.  Breakeven measures of inflation compen-sation derived from Treasury Inflation Protected Securi-ties (TIPS) moved up but remained low.  Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations showed little change.  Judging from interest rate futures, the ex-pected path of the federal funds rate shifted up over the period but continued to imply a gradual expected pace of policy firming.  The deputy manager followed with a discussion of recent developments in money markets and FOMC operations.  Year-end pressures were evi-dent in the market for foreign exchange basis swaps, but conditions returned to normal early in 2018.  Yields on Treasury bills maturing in early March were elevated, re-flecting investors' concerns about the possibility that a failure to raise the federal debt ceiling could affect the timing of principal payments for these securities.  The Open Market Desk continued to execute reinvestment operations for Treasury and agency securities in the SOMA in accordance with the procedure specified in the Committee's directive to the Desk.  The deputy manager also reported on the volume of overnight reverse repur-chase agreement operations over the intermeeting pe-riod and discussed the Desk's plans for small-value op-erational tests of various types of open market opera-tions over the coming year. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeet-ing period.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period. Inflation Analysis and Forecasting The staff presented three briefings on inflation analysis and forecasting.  The presentations reviewed a number of commonly used structural and reduced-form models.  These included structural models in which the rate of inflation is linked importantly to measures of resource slack and a measure of expected inflation relevant for wage and price setting-so-called Phillips curve specifi-cations-as well as statistical models in which inflation is primarily determined by a time-varying inflation trend or longer-run inflation expectations.  The briefings noted several factors beyond those captured in the mod-els that appeared to have put downward pressure on prices in recent years.  These included structural changes in price setting for some items, such as medical care, and the effects of idiosyncratic price shocks, such as the un-usual drop in prices of wireless telephone services in 2017.  The staff found little compelling evidence for the possible influence of other factors such as a more com-petitive pricing environment or a change in the markup of prices over unit labor costs.  Overall, for the set of models presented, the prediction errors in recent years were larger than those observed during the 2001Œ07 pe-riod but were consistent with historical norms and, in most models, did not appear to be biased. The staff presentations considered two key channels by which monetary policy influences inflation-the re-sponse of inflation to changes in resource utilization and the role of inflation expectations, or trend inflation, in the price-setting process.  In part because inflation was importantly influenced by a number of short-lived fac-tors, the effects of current and expected resource utiliza-tion gaps on inflation were not easy to discern empiri-cally.  Estimates of the strength of those effects had di-minished noticeably in recent years.  The briefings high-lighted a number of other challenges associated with es-timating the strength and timing of the linkage between resource utilization and inflation, including the reliability of and changes over time in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and potential output and the ability to adequately account for supply shocks.  In addition, some research suggested that the relationship between re-source utilization and inflation may be nonlinear, with the response of inflation increasing as rates of utilization rise to very high levels. With regard to inflation expectations, two of the brief-ings presented findings that the longer-run trend in in-flation, absent cyclical disturbances or transitory fluctu-ations, had been stable in recent years at a little below 2 percent.  The briefings reported that the average fore-casting performance of models employing either statisti-cal estimates of inflation trends or survey-based measures of inflation expectations as proxies for infla-tion expectations appeared comparable, even though different versions of such models could yield very differ- ent forecasts at any given point in time.  Moreover, al-though survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations tended to move in parallel with estimated inflation trends, the empirical research provided no clear guidance on how to construct a measure of inflation ex-pectations that would be the most useful for inflation forecasting.  The staff noted that although reduced-form models in which inflation tends to revert toward longer-run inflation trends described the data reasonably well, those models offered little guidance to policymakers on how to conduct policy so as to achieve their desired out-come for inflation. Following the staff presentations, participants discussed how the inflation frameworks reviewed in the briefings informed their views on inflation and monetary policy.  Almost all participants who commented agreed that a Phillips curveŒtype of inflation framework remained useful as one of their tools for understanding inflation dynamics and informing their decisions on monetary policy.  Policymakers pointed to a number of possible reasons for the difficulty in estimating the link between resource utilization and inflation in recent years.  These reasons included an extended period of low and stable inflation in the United States and other advanced econ-omies during which the effects of resource utilization on inflation became harder to identify, the shortcomings of commonly used measures of resource gaps, the effects of transitory changes in relative prices, and structural factors that had made business pricing more competitive or prices more flexible over time.  It was noted that re-search focusing on inflation across U.S. states or metro-politan areas continued to find a significant relationship between price or wage inflation and measures of re-source gaps.  A couple of participants questioned the usefulness of a Phillips curveŒtype framework for poli-cymaking, citing the limited ability of such frameworks to capture the relationship between economic activity and inflation. Participants generally agreed that inflation expectations played a fundamental role in understanding and forecast-ing inflation, with stable inflation expectations providing an important anchor for the rate of inflation over the longer run.  Participants acknowledged that the causes of movements in short- and longer-run inflation expec-tations, including the role of monetary policy, were im-perfectly understood.  They commented that various proxies for inflation expectations-readings from household and business surveys or from economic fore-casters, estimates derived from market prices, or esti-mated trends-were imperfect measures of actual infla-tion expectations, which are unobservable.  That said, participants emphasized the critical need for the FOMC to maintain a credible longer-run inflation objective and to clearly communicate the Committee's commitment to achieving that objective.  Several participants indicated that they viewed the available evidence as suggesting that longer-run inflation expectations remained well an-chored; one cited recent research finding that inflation expectations had become better anchored following the Committee's adoption of a numerical inflation target.  However, a few saw low levels of inflation over recent years as reflecting, in part, slippage in longer-run infla-tion expectations below the Committee's 2 percent ob-jective.  In that regard, a number of participants noted the importance of continuing to emphasize that the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective is symmetric.  A couple of participants suggested that the Committee might consider expressing its objective as a range rather than a point estimate.  A few other participants sug-gested that the FOMC could begin to examine whether adopting a monetary policy framework in which the Committee would strive to make up for past deviations of inflation from target might address the challenge of achieving and maintaining inflation expectations con-sistent with the Committee's inflation objective, particu-larly in an environment in which the neutral rate of in-terest appeared likely to remain low. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the January 30Œ31 meet-ing indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen through December and that real gross do-mestic product (GDP) expanded at about a 2½ percent pace in the fourth quarter of last year.  Growth of real final domestic purchases by households and businesses, generally a good indicator of the economy's underlying momentum, was solid.  Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in December.   Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expecta-tions were little changed on balance. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly in December, and the national unemployment rate re-mained at 4.1 percent.  The unemployment rates for His-panics, for Asians, and for African Americans were lower than earlier in the year and close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession.  The national labor force participation rate held steady in December; relative to the declining trend suggested by an aging population, this sideways movement in the participation rate repre-sented a further strengthening in labor market condi-tions.  The participation rate for prime-age (defined as  ages 25 to 54) men edged up in December, while the rate for prime-age women declined slightly.  The share of workers who were employed part time for economic rea-sons was little changed in December and was close to its pre-recession level.  The rates of private-sector job openings and quits were little changed in November, and the four-week moving average of initial claims for un-employment insurance benefits continued to be at a low level in mid-January.  Recent readings showed that gains in hourly labor compensation remained modest.  Both the employment cost index for private-sector workers and average hourly earnings for all employees rose about 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in December. Total industrial production increased over the two months ending in December, with broad-based gains in manufacturing, mining, and utilities output.  Automak-ers' schedules indicated that assemblies of light motor vehicles would likely move up over the coming months.  Broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional man-ufacturing surveys, pointed to further solid increases in factory output in the near term. Real PCE increased strongly in the fourth quarter.  Re-cent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending-including gains in employment, real disposa-ble personal income, and households' net worth-con-tinued to be supportive of further solid growth of real PCE in the near term.  Consumer sentiment in early Jan-uary, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained upbeat.  Real residential investment rose briskly in the fourth quarter after having declined in the previous two quar-ters.  Both starts and issuance of building permits for new single-family homes increased in the fourth quarter as a whole, and starts for multifamily units also moved up.  Moreover, sales of both new and existing homes rose in the fourth quarter. Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-tellectual property increased at a solid pace in the fourth quarter.  Recent indicators of business equipment spend-ing-such as rising new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and upbeat readings on busi-ness sentiment from national and regional surveys-pointed to further gains in equipment spending in the near term.  Firms' real spending for nonresidential struc-tures rose modestly in the fourth quarter, as an increase in outlays for drilling and mining structures was largely offset by a decline in expenditures for other business structures.  The number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation-an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector-continued to edge up through late January. Total real government purchases rose modestly in the fourth quarter.  Increased federal government purchases mostly reflected a rise in defense spending, and the gains in purchases by state and local governments were led by an increase in construction spending in this sector. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened fur-ther in November after widening sharply in October.  Exports of goods and services picked up in November, while imports, particularly of consumer goods, increased robustly.  Available data for goods trade in December suggested that import growth again outpaced export growth.  All told, real net exports were estimated to be a substantial drag on real GDP growth in the fourth quar-ter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased about 1¾ percent over the 12 months ending in December.  Core PCE price infla-tion, which excludes changes in consumer food and en-ergy prices, was 1½ percent over that same period.  The consumer price index (CPI) rose around 2 percent over the same period, while core CPI inflation was 1¾ per-cent.  Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations-including those from the Michigan survey and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants-were little changed on balance. Incoming data suggested that economic activity abroad continued to expand at a solid pace and that this expan-sion was broad based across countries.  In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), real GDP in the euro area and the United Kingdom expanded at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter.  In the emerging market economies (EMEs), Mexico's economy rebounded after being held back by natural disasters in the third quarter.  Economic growth remained solid in China but cooled off a bit in some emerging Asian economies after a very strong third-quarter performance.  Inflation in both AFEs and EMEs picked up significantly in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting a boost from rising oil prices.  Inflation excluding food and energy prices remained well below central bank targets in several economies, including the euro area and Japan. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Domestic financial market conditions eased considera-bly further over the intermeeting period.  A strengthen-ing outlook for economic growth in the United States and abroad, along with recently enacted tax legislation,  appeared to boost investor sentiment.  U.S. equity prices, Treasury yields, and market-based measures of inflation compensation rose, and spreads of yields on investment- and speculative-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over those for comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed further.  In addition, the dollar depreciated broadly amid strong foreign economic data and mone-tary policy communications by some foreign central banks that investors reportedly viewed as less accommo-dative than expected. FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were generally characterized by market participants as consistent with their expectations for continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation.  The Com-mittee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at the December meeting was widely ex-pected, and the probability of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate occurring at the January meeting, as implied by quotes on federal funds futures contracts, remained essentially zero.  Over the inter-meeting period, the futures-implied probability of policy firming at the March meeting rose to about 85 percent; respondents to the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants assigned, on average, similarly high odds to a rate increase at the March meet-ing.  Levels of the federal funds rate at the end of 2018 and 2019 implied by overnight index swap rates moved up moderately. The nominal Treasury yield curve shifted up over the in-termeeting period amid an improved outlook for domes-tic and foreign economic growth.  Yields on both 2- and 10-year Treasury securities moved up about 30 basis points.  Measures of inflation compensation based on TIPS fell in response to the soft reading on core inflation in the November CPI release but subsequently moved up against the backdrop of an improving global growth outlook, higher commodity prices, depreciation of the dollar, and the stronger-than-expected reading on core inflation in the December CPI release.  On net, inflation compensation moved up at both the 5-year and the 5-to-10-year horizons, and both measures returned to levels seen in early 2017 before the string of generally weaker-than-expected inflation readings. Broad equity price indexes rose substantially over the in-termeeting period, with investors pointing to a stronger global economic outlook and the supportive effect of the recently enacted tax legislation on risk sentiment.  The VIX, an index of option-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&P 500 index, increased but re-mained low by historical standards.  Spreads of both in-vestment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields declined slightly and remained well below their historical aver-ages. The FOMC's decision at its December meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate was transmit-ted smoothly to money market rates.  The effective fed-eral funds rate held steady at a level near the middle of the target range except at year-end.  While borrowing costs moved up briefly in offshore dollar funding mar-kets over year-end, conditions in money markets were reported to be orderly.  In line with recent year-end ex-periences, rates and volumes in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets declined, while in secured markets, rates on Treasury repurchase agreements increased.  Af-ter year-end, pressures in money markets abated quickly and rates and volumes returned to recent ranges. The broad nominal dollar index declined nearly 4 per-cent relative to its value at the time of the December FOMC meeting; the decline was most pronounced against AFE currencies, but the dollar depreciated nota-bly against most EME currencies as well.  EME equity prices registered substantial gains, in part supported by a significant rise in commodity prices; emerging market bond spreads narrowed moderately, and flows into EME equity and bond funds strengthened substantially. Market-based measures of policy expectations and longer-term sovereign yields moved up in most AFEs.  The Bank of Canada raised its policy rate at its January meeting, largely in response to better-than-expected eco-nomic data.  The Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank (ECB) left their mone-tary policy stances unchanged, as expected.  Nonethe-less, the ECB president's optimistic assessment of the euro-area economy at the press conference following the January meeting was interpreted by market participants as a signal that monetary policy would be less accommo-dative than expected.  Following those remarks, the euro appreciated notably against the dollar and core euro-area sovereign yields moved higher.  That said, market-based measures of policy expectations continued to indicate that investors anticipate a gradual pace of monetary pol-icy normalization in the euro area. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period and continued to be supportive of economic activity.  Respondents to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Prac-tices (SLOOS) reported easing standards and narrowing  loan spreads for large and middle-market firms and at-tributed this easing to more aggressive competition from other bank or nonbank lenders.  Net debt financing by investment-grade nonfinancial corporations turned neg-ative in December, but the weakness appeared to reflect a softening in the demand for credit, possibly related to the anticipation of higher after-tax cash flows and repa-triation of foreign earnings.  In contrast, gross issuance of speculative-grade bonds and institutional leveraged loans remained strong.  Credit market conditions for small businesses remained relatively accommodative de-spite sluggish credit growth among these firms.  Credit conditions in municipal bond markets also remained ac-commodative. In commercial real estate (CRE) markets, growth of loans held by banks slowed further in the fourth quarter, though CRE loans held by small banks and some types of CRE loans held by large banks-construction and land development loans in particular-expanded at a more robust pace.  Financing conditions in the commer-cial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market re-mained accommodative as issuance continued at a ro-bust pace and spreads on CMBS remained near their lowest levels since the financial crisis.  Credit conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommo-dative for most borrowers, though credit standards re-mained tight for borrowers with low credit scores or hard-to-document incomes.  Mortgage rates increased in tandem with rates on longer-term Treasury securities but remained quite low by historical standards. Conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely supportive of economic activity.  Consumer credit in-creased notably in November, exceeding the more mod-erate volume of borrowing observed earlier in the year.  Revolving credit expanded in November, while nonre-volving credit grew robustly, mainly driven by expansion in student and other consumer loans.  In contrast, growth of auto lending slowed in recent months, con-sistent with the weakening demand for such loans in the fourth quarter as reported in the January SLOOS.  For subprime borrowers, conditions remained tight, particu-larly in the market for credit cards and auto loans. The staff provided its latest report on the potential risks to financial stability; the report continued to characterize the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moderate on balance.  This overall assessment incor-porated the staff's judgment that vulnerabilities associ-ated with asset valuation pressures continued to be ele-vated; asset valuation pressures apparently reflected, in part, a broad-based appetite for risk among investors.  The staff judged that vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial sector appeared to remain moderate, while vulnerabilities stemming from financial-sector leverage and from maturity and liquidity transformation contin-ued to be viewed as low. Staff Economic Outlook The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was stronger than the staff forecast at the time of the December meeting.  Real GDP was estimated to have risen in the fourth quarter of last year by somewhat more than the staff had previ-ously expected, as gains in both household and business spending were larger than anticipated.  Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was revised up, reflecting a reassessment of the recently enacted tax cuts, along with higher projected paths for equity prices and foreign economic growth and a lower assumed path for the for-eign exchange value of the dollar.  Real GDP was pro-jected to increase at a somewhat faster pace than poten-tial output through 2020; the staff continued to assume that the recently enacted tax cuts would boost real GDP growth moderately over the medium term.  The unem-ployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run well below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this pe-riod.  Estimates of total and core PCE price inflation for 2017 were in line with the staff's previous forecast.  The pro-jection for inflation over the medium term was revised up slightly, primarily reflecting tighter resource utiliza-tion in the January forecast.  Total PCE price inflation in 2018 was projected to be somewhat faster than in 2017 despite a slower projected pace of increases in con-sumer energy prices; core PCE prices were forecast to rise notably faster in 2018, importantly reflecting both the expected waning of transitory factors that held down 12-month measures of inflation in 2017 as well as the projected further tightening in resource utilization.  The staff projected that core inflation would reach 2 percent in 2019 and that total inflation would be at the Commit-tee's 2 percent objective in 2020. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  On the one hand, many indicators of uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook remained subdued; on the other hand, considerable uncertainty remained about a number of federal government policies relevant for the economic outlook.  The staff saw the risks to the fore-casts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate  as balanced.  The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced.  Downside risks included the pos-sibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of soft core inflation readings this year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.  These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that infla-tion could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential. Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in December indicated that the labor market continued to strengthen and that economic activity expanded at a solid rate.  Gains in em-ployment, household spending, and business fixed in-vestment were solid, and the unemployment rate stayed low.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy continued to run below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of in-flation compensation increased in recent months but re-mained low; survey-based measures of longer-term in-flation expectations were little changed, on balance. Participants generally saw incoming information on eco-nomic activity and the labor market as consistent with continued above-trend economic growth and a further strengthening in labor market conditions, with the recent solid gains in household and business spending indicat-ing substantial underlying economic momentum.  They pointed to accommodative financial conditions, the re-cently enacted tax legislation, and an improved global economic outlook as factors likely to support economic growth over coming quarters.  Participants expected that with further gradual adjustments in the stance of mone-tary policy, economic activity would expand at a moder-ate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook ap-peared roughly balanced.  Inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.  However, participants judged that it was important to continue to monitor inflation develop-ments closely. Participants expected the recent solid growth in con-sumer spending to continue, supported by further gains in employment and income, increased household wealth resulting from higher asset prices, and high levels of con-sumer confidence.  It was noted that spending on dura-ble goods to replace those damaged during the hurri-canes in September may have provided a temporary boost to consumer spending.  In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant con-sumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in house-hold wealth would be sustained. Participants characterized their business contacts as gen-erally upbeat about the economy; their contacts cited the recent tax cuts and notable improvements in the global economic outlook as positive factors.  Manufacturers in a number of Districts had responded to increased orders by boosting production.  Against a backdrop of higher energy prices and increased global demand for crude oil, a couple of participants revised up their forecasts for en-ergy production in their respective Districts.  Businesses in a number of Districts reported plans to further in-crease investment in coming quarters in order to expand capacity.  Even so, several participants expressed con-siderable uncertainty about the degree to which changes to corporate taxes would support business investment and capacity expansion; according to these participants, firms may be only just beginning to determine how they might allocate their tax savings among investment, worker compensation, mergers and acquisitions, returns to shareholders, or other uses. The labor market had strengthened further in recent months, as indicated by continued solid payroll gains, a small increase in average hours worked, and a labor force participation rate that had held steady despite the longer-run declining trend implied by an aging population.  Many participants reported that labor market conditions were tight in their Districts, evidenced by low unemploy-ment rates, difficulties for employers in filling open po-sitions or retaining workers, or some signs of upward pressure on wages.  The unemployment rate, at 4.1 per-cent, had remained near the lowest level seen in the past 20 years.  It was noted that other labor market indica-tors-such as the U-6 measure of unemployment or the share of involuntary part-time employment-had re-turned to their pre-recession levels.  A few participants judged that while the labor market was close to full em-ployment, some margins of slack remained; these partic-ipants pointed to the employment-to-population ratio or the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers, which remained below pre-recession levels, as well as the absence to date of clear signs of a pickup in aggregate wage growth.  During their discussion of labor market conditions, par-ticipants expressed a range of views about recent wage developments.  While some participants heard more re-ports of wage pressures from their business contacts over the intermeeting period, participants generally noted few signs of a broad-based pickup in wage growth in available data.  With regard to how firms might use part of their tax savings to boost compensation, a few participants suggested that such a boost could be in the form of onetime bonuses or variable pay rather than a permanent increase in wage structures.  It was noted that the pace of wage gains might not increase appreciably if productivity growth remains low.  That said, a number of participants judged that the continued tightening in labor markets was likely to translate into faster wage in-creases at some point. In their discussion of inflation developments, many par-ticipants noted that inflation data in recent months had generally pointed to a gradual rise in inflation, as the 12-month core PCE price inflation rose to 1.5 percent in December, up 0.2 percentage point from the low rec-orded in the summer.  Meanwhile, total PCE price infla-tion was 1.7 percent over the same 12-month period.  Participants anticipated that inflation would continue to gradually rise as resource utilization tightened further and as wage pressures became more apparent; several expected that declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar in recent months would also likely help return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.  Business contacts in a few Districts reported that they had begun to have some more ability to raise prices to cover higher input costs.  That said, a few participants posited that the recently enacted corporate tax cuts might lead firms to cut prices in order to remain competitive or to gain mar-ket share, which could result in a transitory drag on in-flation. With regard to inflation expectations, available readings from surveys had been steady and TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up, although they remained low.  Many participants thought that inflation expectations remained well anchored and would support the gradual return of inflation to the Committee's 2 per-cent objective over the medium term.  However, a few other participants pointed to the record of inflation con-sistently running below the Committee's 2 percent ob-jective over recent years and expressed the concern that longer-run inflation expectations may have slipped be-low levels consistent with that objective. Many participants noted that financial conditions had eased significantly over the intermeeting period; these participants generally viewed the economic effects of the decline in the dollar and the rise in equity prices as more than offsetting the effects of the increase in nominal Treasury yields.  One participant reported that financial market contacts did not see the relatively flat slope of the yield curve as signaling an increased risk of recession.  A few others judged that it would be important to continue to monitor the effects of policy firming on the slope of the yield curve, noting the strong association between past yield curve inversions and recessions.   Regulatory actions and improved risk management in re-cent years had put the financial system in a better posi-tion to withstand adverse shocks, such as a substantial decline in asset prices, than in the past.  However, amid elevated asset valuations and an increased use of debt by nonfinancial corporations, several participants cautioned that imbalances in financial markets may begin to emerge as the economy continued to operate above po-tential.  In this environment, increased use of leverage by nonbank financial institutions might be difficult to detect in a timely manner.  It was also noted that the Committee should regularly reassess risks to the finan-cial system and their implications for the economic out-look in light of the potential for changes in regulatory policies over time.   In their consideration of monetary policy, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and finan-cial developments for the outlook for economic growth, labor market conditions, and inflation and, in turn, for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.  Partici-pants agreed that a gradual approach to raising the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate and reaffirmed that adjustments to the policy path would depend on their assessments of how the economic out-look and risks to the outlook were evolving relative to the Committee's policy objectives.  While participants continued to expect economic activity to expand at a moderate pace over the medium term, they anticipated that the rate of economic growth in 2018 would exceed their estimates of its sustainable longer-run pace and that labor market conditions would strengthen further.  A number of participants indicated that they had marked up their forecasts for economic growth in the near term relative to those made for the December meeting in light of the strength of recent data on economic activity in the United States and abroad, continued accommodative fi-nancial conditions, and information suggesting that the effects of recently enacted tax changes-while still un-certain-might be somewhat larger in the near term than previously thought.  Several others suggested that the  upside risks to the near-term outlook for economic ac-tivity may have increased.  A majority of participants noted that a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate. Almost all participants continued to anticipate that infla-tion would move up to the Committee's 2 percent ob-jective over the medium term as economic growth re-mained above trend and the labor market stayed strong; several commented that recent developments had in-creased their confidence in the outlook for further pro-gress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objec-tive.  A couple noted that a step-up in the pace of eco-nomic growth could tighten labor market conditions even more than they currently anticipated, posing risks to inflation and financial stability associated with sub-stantially overshooting full employment.  However, some participants saw an appreciable risk that inflation would continue to fall short of the Committee's objec-tive.  These participants saw little solid evidence that the strength of economic activity and the labor market was showing through to significant wage or inflation pres-sures.  They judged that the Committee could afford to be patient in deciding whether to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in order to support fur-ther strengthening of the labor market and allow partic-ipants to assess whether incoming information on infla-tion showed that it was solidly on a track toward the Committee's objective. Some participants also commented on the likely evolu-tion of the neutral federal funds rate.  By most estimates, the neutral level of the federal funds rate had been very low in recent years, but it was expected to rise slowly over time toward its longer-run level.  However, the out-look for the neutral rate was uncertain and would de-pend on the interplay of a number of forces.  For exam-ple, the neutral rate, which appeared to have fallen sharply during the Global Financial Crisis when financial headwinds had restrained demand, might move up more than anticipated as the global economy strengthened.  Alternatively, the longer-run level of the neutral rate might remain low in the absence of fundamental shifts in trends in productivity, demographics, or the demand for safe assets. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate.  Gains in employ-ment, household spending, and business fixed invest-ment had been solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed low.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had continued to run below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased in re-cent months but remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Members expected that, with further gradual adjust-ments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activ-ity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong.  In their discussion of the economic outlook, most members viewed the recent data bearing on real economic activity as suggesting a modestly stronger near-term outlook than they had an-ticipated at their meeting in December.  In addition, fi-nancial conditions had remained accommodative, and the details of the tax legislation suggested that its effects on consumer and business spending-while still uncer-tain-might be a bit greater in the near term than they had previously thought.  Although several saw increased upside risks to the near-term outlook for economic ac-tivity, members generally continued to judge the risks to that outlook as remaining roughly balanced. Most members noted that recent information on infla-tion along with prospects for a continued solid pace of economic activity provided support for the view that in-flation on a 12-month basis would likely move up in 2018 and stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent ob-jective over the medium term.  However, a couple of members expressed concern about the outlook for infla-tion, seeing little evidence of a meaningful improvement in the underlying trend in inflation, measures of inflation expectations, or wage growth.  Several members com-mented that they saw both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook, and members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely. After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-bers voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1¼ to 1½ percent.  They indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. Members agreed that the timing and size of future ad-justments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and ex-pected economic conditions relative to the Committee's  objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-flation.  They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of infla-tion pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  Members also agreed to carefully monitor actual and expected in-flation developments relative to the Committee's sym-metric inflation goal.  Members expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.  They judged that a gradual approach to raising the target range would sustain the economic expansion and balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment.  Members agreed that the strengthening in the near-term economic outlook increased the likelihood that a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be ap-propriate.  They therefore agreed to update the charac-terization of their expectation for the evolution of the federal funds rate in the postmeeting statement to point to  further gradual increases  while maintaining the tar-get range at the current meeting.  Members continued to anticipate that the federal funds rate would likely remain, for some time, below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run.  Nonetheless, they again stated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by the incoming data. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.:  Effective February 1, 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under-take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1¼ to 1½ percent, including overnight re-verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur-chase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate week-end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.25 percent, in amounts lim-ited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each cal-endar month that exceeds $12 billion, and to re-invest in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $8 billion.  Small deviations from these amounts for oper-ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:  Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate.  Gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed invest-ment have been solid, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run be-low 2 percent.  Market-based measures of infla-tion compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will ex-pand at a moderate pace and labor market con-ditions will remain strong.  Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 per-cent objective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is moni-toring inflation developments closely. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee de-cided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1¼ to 1½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative,  thereby supporting strong labor market condi-tions and a sustained return to 2 percent infla-tion. In determining the timing and size of future ad-justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-count a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international de-velopments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation develop-ments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic condi-tions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.  Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. Dudley, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Lael Brainard, Loretta J. Mester, Jerome H. Powell, Randal K. Quarles, and John C. Williams. Voting against this action:  None. Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in-terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un-changed at 1½ percent and voted unanimously to ap-prove establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 2 percent.5   It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on TuesdayŒWednesday, March 20Œ21, 2018.
