By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period November 26 through December 16, 1968, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that over-all economic activity is expanding rapidly and that upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Market interest rates have risen considerably further in recent weeks. Bank credit growth has been sustained by continuing strong expansion of time and savings deposits, while growth in the money supply has accelerated and U.S. Government deposits have declined. The U.S. foreign trade surplus remains very small and the over-all balance of payments apparently worsened in October and November. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging a more sustainable rate of economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to attaining firmer conditions in money and short-term credit markets, taking account of the effects of other possible monetary policy action; 12/17/68 -4provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit expansion appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on January 14, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
