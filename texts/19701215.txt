The memorandum of discussion for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on November 17, 1970, was accepted. 12/15/70 -3By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period November 17 through December 14, 1970, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period November 17 through December 14, 1970, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  With Mr. Francis dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services has declined since the third quarter, largely as a consequence of the recent strike in the automobile industry, and that unemployment has increased. Resumption of higher automobile production is expected to result in a bulge in activity in early 1971. Wage rates generally are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, but gains in productivity appear to be slowing the increase in unit labor costs. Movements in major price measures have been diverse; most recently, wholesale prices have shown little change while consumer prices have advanced substantially. Market interest rates declined considerably further in the past few weeks, and Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced by an additional one-quarter of a percentage point. Demands for funds in capital markets have continued heavy, but business loan demands at banks have been weak. Growth in the money supply was somewhat more rapid on average in November than in October, although it remained below the rate prevailing in the first three quarters of the year. Banks acquired a substantial volume of securities in November, and bank credit increased moderately after changing little in October. The foreign trade balance in September and October was smaller than in any other 12/15/70 -42-month period this year. The over-all balance of payments deficit on the liquidity basis remained in October and November at about its third-quarter rate. The deficit on the official settlements basis was very large as banks continued to repay Euro-dollar liabilities. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, while encouraging the resumption of sustainable economic growth and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the recently attained money market conditions until the next meeting of the Committee, provided that the expected rates of growth in money and bank credit will at least be achieved.  By unanimous vote, renewal for further periods of one year of the following swap arrangements, having the indicated amounts and maturity dates, was approved: Amount of Maturity arrangement of latest (millions of authorized Foreign bank dollars) renewal National Bank of Belgium 500 December 22, 1970 Bank of Canada 1,000 December 30, 1970 Bank of France 1,000 December 28, 1970 German Federal Bank 1,000 December 16, 1970 Bank of Italy 1,250 December 30, 1970 Netherlands Bank 300 December 30, 1970 In connection with the foregoing action, it was reported that some of the central banks affected had raised certain technical questions regarding procedures used in the operation of the swap arrangements and that discussions of the matter with those central banks were currently under way. It was agreed that a subcommittee, consisting of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee and 12/15/70 -5the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, or designated alternates, should be authorized to act on behalf of the Committee with respect to the matter, on the understanding that the subcommittee would communicate with the full Conmittee if it had any serious doubts about the appropriate course of action.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, January 12, 1971.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
