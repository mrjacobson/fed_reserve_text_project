Hoskins and Parry dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 5/17/88The information reviewed at this meeting suggests continuing strong expansion in economic activity and rising levels of resource utilization. In April total nonfarm payroll employment rose further; the increase included sizable growth in the manufacturing sector.  The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent, down appreciably from its level at the start of the year. Growth in industrial production picked up considerably in April from a reduced pace earlier in the year. Retail sales fell appreciably last month but estimates of sales in February and March were revised substantially higher. Indicators of business capital spending point to substantial gains thus far this year, notably for equipment. The nominal U.S.  merchandise trade deficit in the first quarter was substantially smaller than that for the fourth quarter.  Consumer and producer prices have risen more rapidly recently following a period of relatively modest increases. Broad measures of labor costs indicate a substantial advance in the first quarter, in part because of a rise in payroll taxes.  Interest rates have risen somewhat since the Committee's meeting on March 29. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of other G-10 currencies had increased slightly on balance over the intermeeting period prior to May 17 and jumped following release of the March trade data.  M1 and M2 grew rapidly in April, owing in part to a buildup in transaction balances associated with tax payments, while M3 expanded at a slower pace than in previous months. Through April, expansion of M2 and M3 was in the upper portion of the ranges established by the Committee for 1988. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to be continuing at a pace close to that in 1987.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established growth ranges of 4 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988. The monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 7 to 11 percent for the year.-3- 5/17/88With respect to M1, the Committee decided in February not to establish a specific target for 1988.  The behavior of this aggregate in relation to economic activity and prices has become very sensitive to changes in interest rates, among other factors, as evidenced by sharp swings in its velocity in recent years. Consequently, the appropriateness of changes in M1 this year will continue to be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  In the initial implementation of policy, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of conditions in financial markets, the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, and the behavior of the monetary aggregates, the Committee expects that a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions would be appropriate in the weeks ahead. Depending on further developments in these factors, somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, also be acceptable later in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of about 6 to 7 percent. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 5 to 9 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on June 29-30, 1988.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary-4-
