By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period September 15 through October 19, 1970, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period September 15 through October 19, 1970, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  With Mr. Hayes dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services increased slightly further in the third quarter but that employment declined and unemployment continued to rise; activity in the current quarter is being adversely affected by a major strike in the automobile industry.  Wage rates generally are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, but improvements in productivity appear to be slowing the increase in costs, and some major price measures are rising less rapidly than before. Most interest rates have declined since mid-September, although yields on corporate and municipal bonds have been sustained by the continuing heavy demands for funds in capital markets. The money supply rose slightly on average in September and increased moderately over the third quarter as a whole. Bank credit expanded further in September but at a rate considerably less than the fast pace of the two preceding months. Banks continued to issue large-denomination CD's at a relatively rapid rate and experienced heavy inflows of consumer-type time and savings funds, while 10/20/70making substantial further reductions in their use of nondeposit sources of funds. The balance of payments deficit on the liquidity basis diminished in the third quarter from the very large second-quarter rate, but the deficit on the official settlements basis remained high as banks repaid Euro-dollar liabilities. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, while encouraging the resumption of sustainable economic growth and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate growth in money and attendant bank credit expansion over the months ahead. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with those objectives, taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financings.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, November 17, 1970, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
