Hayes, Francis, and Scanlon dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The economic and financial developments reviewed at this meeting indicate that economic activity has strengthened and, despite the strike in the automobile industry, that prospects favor more rapid growth later in the year. Upward pressures on costs persist and average prices of industrial commodities have turned up following several months of stability. While there recently have been large inflows of liquid funds from abroad, the balance of payments continues to reflect a substantial underlying deficit. Bank credit expansion has continued large, while most short- and long-term interest rates have fluctuated close to their highs of the year, under the combined pressure of heavy private security market financing and of recent and prospective Federal financing. The President's new fiscal program calling for a sizable increase in income taxes, which would make a substantial contribution to balanced economic growth, is now before Congress. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions, including bank credit growth, conducive to sustainable economic expansion, recognizing the need for reasonable price stability for both domestic and balance of payments purposes.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the prevailing conditions in the money market; but operations shall be modified as necessary to moderate any apparent tendency for bank credit to expand significantly more than currently expected. 9/12/67It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, October 3, 1967, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.
