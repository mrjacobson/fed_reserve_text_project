The memorandum of discussion for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 15, 1970, was accepted.-2- 1/12/71By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period December 15, 1970, through January 11, 1971, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period December 15, 1970, through January 11, 1971, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  With Mr. Francis dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services declined in the fourth quarter of 1970, largely as a consequence of the recent strike in the automobile industry. Unemployment increased further in December. The resumption of higher automobile production is expected to result in a bulge in activity in early 1971. Wage rates generally are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, but gains in productivity appear to be slowing the increase in unit labor costs. The rise in both wholesale and consumer prices appears to have moderated recently, following substantial increases earlier in the fall. Most market interest rates turned down again in recent days, and Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced by an additional one-quarter of a percentage point. Demands for funds in capital markets have continued heavy, but business loan demands at banks remain weak. Although growth in the money supply accelerated in December, over the fourth quarter as a whole it was at a rate below that prevailing in the preceding three quarters.  Banks made substantial further additions to their holdings of securities in December, and bank credit increased sharply. The foreign trade surplus has declined markedly in recent months. The over-all balance of payments deficit on the liquidity basis in the fourth 1/12/71quarter was apparently about as large as in the third quarter. The deficit on the official settlements basis was very large as banks continued to repay Euro-dollar liabilities. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the resumption of sustainable economic growth, while encouraging an orderly reduction in the rate of inflation and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote accommodative conditions in credit markets and moderate expansion in monetary and credit aggregates.  System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with those objectives, taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, February 9, 1971, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
