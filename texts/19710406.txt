Hayes and Kimbrel dissenting, the FederalReserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until other-wise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in theSystem Account in accordance with the following current economicpolicy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggeststhat real output of goods and services rose substan-tially in the first quarter primarily because of theresumption of higher automobile production, but thatthe unemployment rate remained high. More moderategrowth in real GNP appears to be in prospect for thecurrent quarter. Wage rates in most sectors are con-tinuing to rise at a rapid pace. The rate of advancein consumer prices and in wholesale prices of indus-trial commodities appears to have moderated recently.In March bank credit and the money stock both narrowlyand broadly defined again expanded substantially,although the increases were less sharp than in February.Inflows of consumer-type time and savings funds to banksand nonbank thrift institutions reached unusually highlevels in the first quarter as interest rates on com-petitive short-term market instruments declined con-siderably further. In recent weeks, however, key short-term interest rates have moved up somewhat on balance.Yields on new issues of corporate and municipal bonds4/6/71-3- 4/6/71 -4-declined during much of March despite a continuingheavy calendar of offerings, but most recently long-term market yields have also risen somewhat. The over-all balance of payments deficit in the first quarterwas exceptionally large. The trade surplus for thefirst two months was very small, and capital outflowshave been stimulated by wide short-term interest ratedifferentials. Despite recent reductions in the dis-count rates of several European central banks, thesedifferentials remain wide. In light of the foregoingdevelopments, it is the policy of the Federal OpenMarket Committee to foster financial conditions con-ducive to the resumption of sustainable economic growth,while encouraging an orderly reduction in the rate ofinflation, moderation of short-term capital outflows,and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in thecountry's balance of payments.To implement this policy, while taking account ofthe Treasury financing the terms of which are to beannounced late in the month, System open market opera-tions until the next meeting of the Committee shall beconducted with a view to attaining temporarily someminor firming in money market conditions, while con-tinuing to meet some part of reserve needs throughpurchases of coupon issues in the interest of promotingaccommodative conditions in long-term credit markets;provided that money market conditions shall be modifiedif it appears that the monetary and credit aggregatesare deviating significantly from the growth pathsdesired.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal OpenMarket Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 4, 1971, at9:30 a.m.The meeting adjourned.Secretary
