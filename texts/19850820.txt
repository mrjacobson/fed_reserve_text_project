By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities and agency obligations during the period July 10, 1985, through August 19, 1985, were ratified.  With Mr. Black and Ms. Seger dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 8/20/85The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is probably expanding in the current quarter at a moderately faster rate than in the first half of the year. In July, industrial production continued to move somewhat higher and total retail sales rose modestly after two months of decline. On the other hand, housing starts fell somewhat in July. Information on business capital spending suggests further growth, though at a much less rapid pace than earlier in the economic expansion. Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to increase in July, although employment in manufacturing declined slightly further. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent in July, unchanged since February. Broad measures of prices and wages appear to be rising at rates close to those recorded in 1984.  Since the Committee's meeting in July, the tradeweighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has depreciated further. The merchandise trade deficit widened in the second quarter to the highest rate on record. Both agricultural and nonagricultural exports fell substantially, while imports registered a small increase.  Based on data for July and early August, M1 has been growing relatively rapidly. Demand deposits have shown little change on balance, but other checkable deposits have expanded substantially. Growth in M2 has continued at around the upper end of its 1985 range, while relatively sluggish growth in M3 recently has brought this aggregate to the midpoint of its range. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has remained high relative to the Committee's monitoring range for the year. Most interest rates have risen somewhat since the July meeting of the Committee.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at the July meeting reaffirmed ranges for the year of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 9 to 12 percent. With respect to M1, the base was moved forward to the second quarter of 8/20/851985 and a range was established at an annual growth rate of 3 to 8 percent. The range takes account of expectations of a return of velocity growth toward more usual patterns, following the sharp decline in velocity during the first half of the year, while also recognizing a higher degree of uncertainty regarding that behavior. The appropriateness of the new range will continue to be reexamined in the light of evidence with respect to economic and financial developments including developments in foreign exchange markets. More generally, the Committee agreed that growth in the aggregates may be in the upper parts of their ranges, depending on continuing developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.  For 1986 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 8 to 11 percent for 1986. With respect to M1 particularly, the Committee recognized that uncertainties surrounding recent behavior of velocity would require careful reappraisal of the target range at the beginning of 1986. Moreover, in establishing ranges for next year, the Committee also recognized that account would need to be taken of experience with institutional and depositor behavior in response to the completion of deposit rate deregulation early in the year.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the degree of pressure on reserve positions sought in recent weeks.  This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 at annual rates of around 8-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent, respectively, during the period from June to September. M1 growth is expected to slow from its recent pace, but given the rapid growth in recent weeks, expansion over the June to September period may be at an 8 to 9 percent annual rate. Somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable in the event of substantially higher growth in the monetary aggregates.  Somewhat lesser restraint would be acceptable in the-4- 8/20/85event of substantially slower growth. In either case such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on October 1, 1985.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary-5-
