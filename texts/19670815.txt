By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The economic and financial developments reviewed at this meeting indicate that economic activity has been expanding more rapidly in recent weeks. With strengthening of private demands for final products and further curtailment of inventory investment, a better balance between inventories and sales is emerging. Upward pressures on costs persist and the over-all indexes of both wholesale and consumer prices have risen further. The balance of payments deficit has remained substantial and is a serious national problem. Bank credit expansion has continued large, while most short- and long-term interest rates have fluctuated close to their highs of the year, under the combined pressure of heavy private security 8/15/67market financing and of current and prospective Federal financing. A new fiscal program has been proposed by the President, including a sizable increase in income taxes, which would make a substantial contribution to balanced economic growth. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions, including bank credit growth, conducive to continuing economic expansion, while recognizing the need for reasonable price stability for both domestic and balance of payments purposes.  To implement this policy, while taking account of expected Treasury financing activity, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the prevailing conditions in the money market; but operations shall be modified, insofar as Treasury financing permits, to moderate any apparent tendency for bank credit to expand more than currently expected.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, September 12, 1967, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Assistant Secretary
