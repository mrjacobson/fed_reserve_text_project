By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period August 17 through September 20, 1976, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services has remained moderate in the current quarter. In August industrial production continued to expand at about the average rate in the preceding 4 months. Retail sales apparently rose vigorously, after having changed little on balance since April. Payroll employment in nonfarm establishments rose appreciably further, but according to household survey data, the unemployment rate edged up from 7.8 to 7.9 per cent. The wholesale price index for all commodities was about unchanged in August, as a substantial decline in average prices of farm products and foods offset another large increase in average prices of industrial commodities. So far this year the advance in the index of average wage rates has been somewhat below the rapid rate of increase during 1975.-3 - 9/21/76The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has remained relatively steady in recent weeks, declining somewhat against most of these currencies but rising against the pound sterling. The Mexican peso was allowed to depreciate on September 1 and in recent days has been about 37 per cent below its old value against the dollar. In July the U.S. foreign trade deficit increased sharply.  M1 and M2 grew at moderate rates in August. Inflows of the time and savings deposits included in M2 were relatively strong, although they slackened from the high rate in July. Inflows of deposits to nonbank thrift institutions accelerated, however, and growth in M3 remained rapid. Most market interest rates have declined somewhat further in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on October 19, 1976, at 9:30 a.m.The meeting adjourned.-4 -
