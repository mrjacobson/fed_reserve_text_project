The report of examination of the System Open Market Account, made by the Board's Division of Federal Reserve Bank Operations as of the close of business on February 22, 1988, was accepted.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period August 16, 1988, through September 19, 1988 were ratified.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period August 16,1988, through September 19, 1988, were ratified. By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity may be moderating from the vigorous pace earlier in the year.  Total nonfarm payroll employment grew more slowly in July and August, though the increases in the two months were still sizable. The civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in August. Industrial production advanced slightly further in August after a sharp increase in July. Retail sales were flat in July and August. Recent indicators of business capital spending suggest some moderation from the especially rapid growth in earlier months of the year. Preliminary data for the nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July showed some further reduction from the improved second-quarter rate. The latest information on prices suggests little if any change from recent trends.  Most interest rates have declined somewhat since the Committee meeting on August 16. Over the intermeeting period, the trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was about unchanged on balance.  Expansion of M2 and M3 moderated further in August.  For the year through August, M2 has grown at a rate slightly above, and M3 at a rate more noticeably above, the midpoints of the ranges established by the Committee for 1988. M1 was unchanged in August after registering relatively strong growth in June and July. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt for the year thus far appears to be at a pace somewhat below that in 1987.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in late June reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of 4 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was also maintained at 7 to 11 percent for the year. For 1989, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989, of 3 to 7 percent for M2 and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent for M3. The Committee set the associated monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  It was understood that all these ranges were provisional and that they would be reviewed in early 1989 in the light of intervening developments.  With respect to M1, the Committee reaffirmed its decision in February not to establish a specific target for 1988 and also decided not to set a tentative range for 1989. The behavior of this aggregate will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from August through December at annual rates of about 3 and 5 percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, November 1, 1988.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
