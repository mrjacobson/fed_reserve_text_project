With Mr. Holland dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services leveled off in the second quarter of the year, as consumer spending continued to strengthen. Activity in residential real estate markets has picked up in recent months. In June industrial production rose slightly, following 8 months of decline. The calculated unemployment rate declined substantially, but this was attributed mainly to problems of seasonal adjustment. Average wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose somewhat more in June than in the preceding 3 months, chiefly because of increases in prices of petroleum products, but prices of farm and food products declined appreciably. From the first to the second quarter of the year, the advance in average wage rates continued to moderate.  In recent weeks the average exchange value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has risen considerably, as interest rates on U.S. dollar assets increased relative to rates on foreign currency assets after mid-June. In May the U.S. foreign trade balance 7/15/75registered a substantial surplus, as imports dropped more sharply than exports. U.S. banks reported a sizable increase in claims on foreigners, while liabilities to foreigners were reduced slightly.  Growth in M1, M2, and M3--which was substantial in May--was extremely rapid in June, in part because of Federal income tax rebates and of supplementary social security payments; beginning late in the month, after completion of such payments, the aggregates weakened. Business demands for short-term credit remained unusually weak both at banks and in the commercial paper market, while demands in the longterm market continued exceptionally strong. Market interest rates in general have risen appreciably in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to stimulating economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and working toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing and of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing bank reserve and money market conditions over the period immediately ahead, provided that growth in monetary aggregates appears to be slowing substantially from the bulge during the second quarter.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, August 19, 1975.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary Secretary
