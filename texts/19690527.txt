By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: 5/27/69The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that expansion in real economic activity is continuing to moderate slightly, but that substantial upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Interest rates have risen in recent weeks. Bank credit and the money supply appear to be changing little on average in May after bulging in April. The outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's has continued to decline, and the available evidence suggests only modest recovery in other time and savings deposits at banks and in savings balances at nonbank thrift institutions following the outflows of the first half of April. The U.S. balance of payments on the liquidity basis was in sizable deficit in the first 4 months of 1969 but the balance on the official settlements basis remained in surplus as a result of large inflows of Euro-dollars. However, there were substantial outflows of funds from the United States in the first half of May, during the period of intense speculation on a revaluation of the German mark, and the payments balance was in very large deficit on both bases. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging a more sustainable rate of economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing pressure on money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if .bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, June 24, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
