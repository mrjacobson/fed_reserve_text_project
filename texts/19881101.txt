Total nonfarm payroll employment grew considerably in the third quarter but the gains were less than those registered in the first half of the year and employment in manufacturing declined in August and September. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent in September, remaining in the narrow range that has prevailed since early spring. Industrial production advanced only slightly on balance in August and September after a sharp increase in July, while housing construction has been flat in recent months. Consumer spending increased substantially on average in the third quarter but apparently slowed in recent months. Indicators of business capital spending suggest considerably slower expansion in the third quarter, following very rapid growth in the first half of the year. Preliminary data for the nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in August showed a greater deficit than in July, but the average for July-August was slightly less than the second-quarter rate. The latest information on prices and wages suggests little if any change from recent trends.  Interest rates in long-term debt markets have declined a little further since the Committee meeting on September 20, while rates in short-term markets have edged higher. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined appreciably over the intermeeting period from the high level of last summer.  Expansion of M2 has slowed considerably in recent months; growth of M3 moderated in August and September but appears to have strengthened somewhat in October.  Thus far this year, M2 has grown at a rate somewhat below, and M3 at a rate somewhat above, the midpoint of the ranges established by the Committee for 1988. M1 has increased only slightly on balance in recent months after registering relatively strong growth in June and July. Expansion of total domestic nonfinancial debt for the year thus far appears to be at a pace somewhat below that in 1987. -5-The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in late June reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of 4 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was also maintained at 7 to 11 percent for the year.  For 1989, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989, of 3 to 7 percent for M2 and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent for M3. The Committee set the associated monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  It was understood that all these ranges were provisional and that they would be reviewed in early 1989 in the light of intervening developments.  With respect to M1, the Committee reaffirmed its decision in February not to establish a specific target for 1988 and also decided not to set a tentative range for 1989. The behavior of this aggregate will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from September through December at annual rates of about 2-1/2 and 6 percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent. -6It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Wednesday, December 14, 1988.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
