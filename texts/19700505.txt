With Mr. Francis dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that real economic activity weakened further in the first quarter of 1970. Growth in personal income, however, is being stimulated in the second quarter by the enlargement of social security benefit payments and the Federal pay raise. Prices and costs generally are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, although some components of major price indexes recently have shown moderating tendencies. Most market interest rates have risen sharply in recent weeks as a result of heavy demands for funds, possible shifts in liquidity preferences, and the disappointment of earlier expectations regarding easing of credit market conditions. Prices of common stocks have declined 5/5/70markedly since early April. Attitudes in financial markets generally are being affected by the expansion of military operations in Southeast Asia and by concern about the success of the Government's anti-inflationary program. Both bank credit and the money supply rose substantially from March to April on average, although during the course of April bank credit leveled off and the money supply receded sharply from the end-of-March bulge. The over-all balance of payments was in considerable deficit during the first quarter. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, while encouraging the resumption of sustainable economic growth and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee desires to see moderate growth in money and bank credit over the months ahead. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with that objective, taking account of the current Treasury financing; provided, however, that operations shall be modified as needed to moderate excessive pressures in financial markets, should they develop.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 26, 1970, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
