By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 9-10, 1988, were approved.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 10 through March 28, 1988, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in government securities and agency obligations during the period February 10 through March 28, 1988, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $6 billion to $10 billion the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System Account holdings of U.S.  government and federal agency securities for the intermeeting period ending May 17, 1988. With Ms. Seger dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests some moderation in the expansion of economic activity in the current quarter from the rapid pace in the fourth quarter; the continuing expansion has been supported by a sharp pickup in domestic final sales while the accumulation of inventories appears to have slowed. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially over the first two months of the year, although employment growth slowed somewhat in the manufacturing sector. The civilian unemployment rate fell slightly to 5.7 percent in February. Growth in industrial production moderated in early 1988 from a brisk pace during the second half of 1987. Consumer spending strengthened in January and February, buoyed by higher sales of motor vehicles. Indicators of business capital spending pointed to substantial gains in the first quarter. Housing starts rebounded in February but were still somewhat below the reduced fourth-quarter average. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit changed little in January and was significantly below the fourth-quarter average. In recent months the rise in consumer and producer prices has been relatively modest on balance, reflecting developments in food and energy prices, and wage trends have shown little change.  Most interest rates were up somewhat on balance since the Committee's meeting in February, with the largest increases concentrated in bond markets. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fluctuated in a relatively narrow range over most of the intermeeting period, but declined somewhat in recent days.  After strengthening in January, growth of M2 and M3 remained relatively robust in February and in the first part of March. Thus far this year expansion of these two aggregates appears to have been in the upper portion of the ranges established by the Committee for 1988. M1 has grown moderately on balance since the fourth quarter. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to be continuing at a pace close to that in 1987.3/29/88-13 - 3/29/88-14 -The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established growth ranges of 4 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988. The monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 7 to 11 percent for the year.  With respect to M1, the Committee decided in February not to establish a specific target for 1988.  The behavior of this aggregate in relation to economic activity and prices has become very sensitive to changes in interest rates, among other factors, as evidenced by sharp swings in its velocity in recent years.  Consequently, the appropriateness of changes in M1 this year will continue to be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions. The Committee agrees that the current more normal approach to open market operations remains appropriate; still sensitive conditions in financial markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may continue to call for some flexibility in operations. Taking account of conditions in financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of about 6 to 7 percent. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 17, 1988.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
