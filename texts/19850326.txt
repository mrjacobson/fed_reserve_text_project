To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U. S.

D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding $8.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open position in all-5 - 3/26/85foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.  2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements ("swap" arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity: Amount of arrangement (millions of dollars Foreign bank equivalent) Austrian National Bank 250 National Bank of Belgium 1,000 Bank of Canada 2,000 National Bank of Denmark 250 Bank of England 3,000 Bank of France 2,000 German Federal Bank 6,000 Bank of Italy 3,000 Bank of Japan 5,000 Bank of Mexico 700 Netherlands Bank 500 Bank of Norway 250 Bank of Sweden 300 Swiss National Bank 4,000 Bank for International Settlements: Dollars against Swiss francs 600 Dollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs 1,250 Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  3.

By unanimous vote, paragraph l(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $4 billion to $6 billion the limit on intermeeting changes in System account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities. With this amendment, the authorization reads as follows: AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS Amended March 26, 1985 1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee: (a) To buy or sell U. S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U. S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; provided that the aggregate amount of U. S. Government and Federal agency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments) at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not be increased or decreased by more than $6.0 billion during the period commencing with the opening of business on the day following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting; 3/26/85-11 -(b) When appropriate, to buy or sell in the open market, from or to acceptance dealers and foreign accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at market discount rates, prime bankers acceptances with maturities of up to nine months at the time of acceptance that (1) arise out of the current shipment of goods between countries or within the United States, or (2) arise out of the storage within the United States of goods under contract of sale or expected to move into the channels of trade within a reasonable time and that are secured throughout their life by a warehouse receipt or similar document conveying title to the underlying goods; provided that the aggregate amount of bankers acceptances held at any one time shall not exceed $100 million; (c) To buy U. S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, and prime bankers acceptances of the types authorized for purchase under 1(b) above, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities, obligations, or acceptances in 15 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account; and provided further that in the event bankers acceptances covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the seller, they shall continue to be held by the Federal Reserve Bank or shall be sold in the open market.  2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Banks to lend U. S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as the Committee may specify from time to time.  3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U. S. Government securities to such foreign and international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph 1(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, 3/26/85-12 -subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph 1(c), repurchase agreements in U. S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 12-13, 1985, were approved.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period February 13 through March 25, 1985, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 13 through March 25, 1985 were ratified.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP is currently expanding at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter, with an increased share of domestic spending apparently being met out of imports.  Total retail sales rose considerably for January and February combined and housing starts, though declining in February, were above their fourth-quarter pace.  However, information on business capital spending suggests less rapid expansion in early 1985. Business inventory investment continues at a moderate rate.  Industrial production declined on balance in January and February and, with employment falling in the manufacturing sector, total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a somewhat reduced pace. The civilian unemployment rate, at 7.3 percent in February, was little changed from its level at year-end. Broad measures of prices and the index of average hourly earnings appear to be continuing to rise at rates close to those recorded in 1984. 3/26/85Since the Committee's meeting in mid-February, the foreign exchange value of the dollar has fluctuated widely in often volatile market conditions. Most recently, the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has dropped sharply, more than offsetting its rise earlier in the intermeeting interval. Monetary authorities sold dollars on a large scale during the period, especially in late February and early March. The merchandise trade deficit increased sharply in January from relatively low December and fourth-quarter rates. The current account deficit for the full year 1984 was more than double that recorded in 1983.  Growth in M1 accelerated in February, following relatively rapid expansion in other recent months, but information available through mid-March indicates a considerable slowing. Growth in the broader aggregates moderated in February and appears to be slowing further in March. In January and February expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remained relatively rapid, though somewhat below the pace of previous months.  Most interest rates have risen somewhat since the February meeting of the Committee.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at its meeting in February to establish ranges for monetary growth of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985.  The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 9 to 12 percent for the year 1985.  The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary aggregates in the upper part of their ranges for 1985 may be appropriate, depending on developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.-13 - 3/26/85-14 -The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, taking account of the progress against inflation, uncertainties in the business outlook, and the exchange value of the dollar, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.  This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of around 6, 7, and 8 percent respectively during the period from March to June. Somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth of the monetary aggregates while somewhat greater restraint might be acceptable in the event of substantially higher growth. In either case such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 21, 1985.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary Secretary's note: On April 16, 1985, by unanimous vote, with Mr. Timlen voting as alternate for Mr. Corrigan and Messrs. Partee, Rice and Wallich absent and not voting, Committee members approved a temporary increase from $6 billion to $9 billion in the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities for the period ending May 21, 1985.
