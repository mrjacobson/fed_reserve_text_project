Renewal for further periods of 3 months of System drawings on the German Federal Bank maturing in the period April 3 through June 30, 1978, and a drawing on the Swiss National Bank maturing on April 26, 1978, was authorized.  Prior to the following action, Mr. Smith left the meeting.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period February 28 through March 20, 1978, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services has been adversely affected in the current quarter by unusually severe weather and the lengthy strike in coal mining but that there has been little change in the underlying economic situation. In February industrial production-7 - 3/21/78recovered much of the decline of the preceding month, and nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably further. The unemployment rate declined from 6.3 to 6.1 per cent. Retail sales picked up somewhat from the sharply reduced level of January. The pace of the rise in prices stepped up in February, reflecting large increases in farm products and processed foods.  The index of average hourly earnings was unchanged, after having advanced sharply in January when higher minimum wages became effective.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose sharply in anticipation of the U.S.- German announcements on March 13. Subsequently, the dollar declined to about the level at the end of February. The U. S. trade statistics reported for January showed a continuing large deficit.  M-1 declined and M-2 increased relatively little in February, apparently in part because of the economic effects of the coal strike and the severe weather. Inflows to banks of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 were about maintained, but the inflows were almost entirely into large-denomination time deposits exempt from ceilings on interest rates. Inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained slow. Market interest rates have changed little in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on February 28, 1978, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and-8 - 3/21/78M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 1977 to the fourth quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage nearterm rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the March-April period to be within ranges of 4 to 8 per cent for M-1 and 5-1/2 to 9 per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of about 6-3/4 per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 6-1/2 to 7 per cent. In the conduct of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken of emerging financial market conditions, including the conditions in foreign exchange markets.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  Consideration was then given to the continuing authorizations of the Committee, in accordance with the customary practice of reviewing such matters at the firstregular meeting in March of every year.-9 - 3/21/78Secretary's note: On March 2, 1978, certain continuing authorizations of the Committee, listed below, had been distributed by the Secretary with the advice that, in accordance with procedures approved by the Committee, they were being called to the Committee's attention before the March organization meeting to give members an opportunity to raise any questions they had concerning them. Members were asked to so indicate if they wished to have any of the authorizations in question placed on the agenda for consideration at this meeting, and no such requests were received.  The authorizations in question were as follows: 1. Procedures for allocation of securities in the System Open Market Account.  2. List of Treasury Department officials to whom weekly reports on open market operations may be sent.  3. Authority for the Chairman to appoint a Federal Reserve Bank as agent to operate the System Account in case the New York Bank is unable to function.  4. Resolutions providing for continued operation of the Committee and for certain actions by the Reserve Banks during an emergency.  5. Resolution relating to examinations of the System Open Market Account.  6. Guidelines for the conduct of System operations in Federal agency issues.  7. Regulation relating to Open Market Operations of Federal Reserve Banks.  8. Rules of Organization, Rules Regarding Availability of Information, and Rules of Procedure.-10 - 3/21/78It was agreed that the authorization for the lending of Government securities from the System Open Market Account, contained in paragraph 3 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, should be retained at this time, subject to annual review.  By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations shown below was reaffirmed: AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS 1.
