With Messrs. Volcker, Eastburn, and Jackson dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that output of goods and services--which had increased sharply in the third quarter--is expanding more moderately in the current quarter. Retail sales are reported to have risen in October, after 2 months of little net change.  Industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment continued to recover, although at a less rapid rate than in the summer months. The unemployment rate rose to 8.6 per cent from 8.3 per cent in September, reflecting a sizable increase in the civilian labor force. Average wholesale prices of industrial commodities increased more in October than in the immediately preceding months, and prices of farm and food products rose sharply further. However, since mid-October prices of many agricultural products have declined. The advance in average wage rates in October was substantial.  Since mid-October the exchange value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has moved in a narrow range. The U.S. foreign trade surplus in September remained substantial, as both exports and imports rose moderately. Bank-reported private capital flows appear to have shifted to net outflows since September, and the volume of offerings of new foreign bonds in the U.S.  market has been at record levels. 11/18/75M1 rose at a 6.9 per cent annual rate from the average level during the second quarter to the average level during the third quarter. However, M1 grew relatively little in the months of the third quarter and it declined in October. Inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to banks and to nonbank thrift institutions remained moderate in October, and growth in M2 and M3 slowed further. Most short- and long-term interest rates have declined further in recent weeks. Conditions in markets for State and local government securities have continued to be adversely affected by New York's financial problems.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking more than usual account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on December 16, 1975, at 9:00 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
