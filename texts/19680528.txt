By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period April 30 through May 27, 1968, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that the very rapid increase in over-all economic activity is being accompanied by persisting inflationary pressures.  There has been little or no growth on average in bank credit and time and savings deposits over the past two months, although the money supply has expanded considerably as U.S. Government deposits have declined. In recent 5/28/68weeks both short- and long-term interest rates have risen sharply on balance from their earlier advanced levels, partly in reaction to shifting expectations with regard to the likelihood of fiscal restraint. There has been some revival of speculative activity in the private gold market and in foreign exchange markets. The U.S. foreign trade balance and over-all payments position continue to be a matter of serious concern. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resistance of inflationary pressures and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments, while taking account of the potential for severe pressures in financial markets if fiscal restraint is not forthcoming.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining firm conditions in the money market; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections or if unusual pressures should develop in financial markets.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, June 18, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
