By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting, including strong recent gains in industrial production, employment, and retail sales, suggests that real output of goods and services is growing more rapidly in the current quarter than in the third quarter. The unemployment rate has declined. Wage rates increased little in November, following 2 months of large increases. Consumer prices rose considerably again in October, and wholesale prices rose sharply in November. The over-all deficit in the U.S. balance of payments has remained substantial in recent months, but there has been a moderate reduction in the excess of U.S. merchandise imports over exports since last spring and summer.  In November rates of growth in the monetary aggregates generally remained moderate, but expansion in the narrowly defined money stock quickened in early December.  In recent weeks most market interest rates have tended upward.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement 12/19/72of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of Treasury financing operations and possible credit market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support slower growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than appears indicated for the second half of this year.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, January 16, 1973, at 9:30 a.m.  Thereupon the meeting adjourned.Secretary
