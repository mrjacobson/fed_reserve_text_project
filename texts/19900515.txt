By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period March 27, 1990, through May 14, 1990, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period March 27, 1990, through May 14, 1990, were ratified.  With Mr. Hoskins dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is continuing to expand moderately. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased more slowly in March and April after sharp advances earlier in the year; its average growth thus far this year has been above that in the second half of 1989, in part because of the hiring of temporary workers for the census. In April, the civilian unemployment rate moved up to 5.4 percent. Industrial production declined in April, reflecting what appears to be a temporary cutback in the manufacture of motor vehicles. Consumer spending has been sluggish on balance in recent months; outlays for goods have been weak while expenditures for services have remained strong. Business spending for equipment has been rising, but construction activity, both residential and nonresidential, appears to have weakened after a temporary boost early in the year. The nominal U.S.  merchandise trade deficit narrowed somewhat in January and February from its average rate in the fourth quarter. Consumer prices continued to rise at a faster pace in March than in 1989; producer prices were down somewhat further in April, reflecting additional unwinding of the earlier surge in prices of food and energy. The latest data on employment costs suggest some deterioration in underlying trends.  Short-term interest rates have declined a little on balance since the Committee meeting on March 27, while rates in long-term debt markets have risen slightly over the period. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined considerably over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 slowed in April and that of M3 remained relatively weak. Through April, expansion of M2 and M3 was a little above the midpoint and around the lower end, respectively, of the ranges established by the Committee for 1990.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 5 to 9 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of progress toward price stability, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of about 4 and 3 percent respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Monday-Tuesday July 2-3, 1990.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
