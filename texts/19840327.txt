The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent necessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time to time: A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U. S. Treasury, with the U. S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with other international financial institutions: Austrian schillings Belgian francs Canadian dollars Danish kroner Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Japanese yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above.  C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.  D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding $8.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open position in all-5 - 3/26-27/84foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.  2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements ("swap" arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity: Amount of arrangement (millions of dollars Foreign bank equivalent) Austrian National Bank 250 National Bank of Belgium 1,000 Bank of Canada 2,000 National Bank of Denmark 250 Bank of England 3,000 Bank of France 2,000 German Federal Bank 6,000 Bank of Italy 3,000 Bank of Japan 5,000 Bank of Mexico 700 Netherlands Bank 500 Bank of Norway 250 Bank of Sweden 300 Swiss National Bank 4,000 Bank for International Settlements: Dollars against Swiss francs 600 Dollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs 1,250 Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1(A) above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of providing an investment-6 - 3/26-27/84return on System holdings of foreign currencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.  4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested insofar as practicable, considering needs for minimum working balances. Such investments shall be in liquid form, and generally have no more than 12 months remaining to maturity. When appropriate in connection with arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency holdings, U. S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign central banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar days.  6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee.  The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board Members designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, his alternate).

The Chairman is authorized: A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the Treasury; B.

The Manager for Foreign Operations shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System, and about any operations that are not of a routine character.  By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations shown below was reaffirmed: AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS Reaffirmed March 26, 1984 1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee: (a) To buy or sell U. S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U. S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; provided that the aggregate amount of U. S. Government and Federal agency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments) at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not be increased or decreased by more than $4.0 billion during the period commencing with the opening of business on the day following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting; (b) When appropriate, to buy or sell in the open market, from or to acceptance dealers and foreign accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at market discount rates, prime bankers acceptances with maturities of up to nine months at the time of acceptance that (1) arise out of the current shipment of 3/26-27/84-11 -goods between countries or within the United States, or (2) arise out of the storage within the United States of goods under contract of sale or expected to move into the channels of trade within a reasonable time and that are secured throughout their life by a warehouse receipt or similar document conveying title to the underlying goods; provided that the aggregate amount of bankers acceptances held at any one time shall not exceed $100 million; (c) To buy U. S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, and prime bankers acceptances of the types authorized for purchase under 1(b) above, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities, obligations, or acceptances in 15 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account; and provided further that in the event bankers acceptances covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the seller, they shall continue to be held by the Federal Reserve Bank or shall be sold in the open market.  2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Banks to lend U. S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as the Committee may specify from time to time.  3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U. S. Government securities to such foreign and international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph 1(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph 1(c), repurchase agreements in U. S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate. 3/26-27/84-12 -By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed the agreement of January 17, 1977, to "warehouse" foreign currencies for the Exchange Stabilization Fund and for the Treasury on the terms agreed upon by the Committee at its meeting on March 18, 1980, with the understanding that the agreement would be subject to annual review.  By unanimous vote, the Committee agreed to discontinue use of repurchase agreements on bankers' acceptances in conducting open market operations. The effective date of this action is July 2, 1984.  By unanimous vote, the Committee adopted a program for safeguarding confidential FOMC information.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on January 30-31, 1984, were approved.  By unanimous vote, paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $4 billion to $6 billion the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System account holdings of U.S.  government and federal agency securities effective March 28 through the close of business on May 22, 1984.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period January 31 through March 26, 1984, were ratified.  Secretary's Note: All of the above actions were taken on Monday, March 26, 1984.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 3/26-27/84The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that growth in real GNP has accelerated markedly in the current quarter and suggests that demand for goods and services may remain relatively strong in the months ahead. In January and February, industrial production rose at a considerably faster pace than in the fourth quarter, and gains in nonfarm payroll employment were large over the two-month period. The civilian unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage point each month to 7.8 percent in February. Retail sales grew at an exceptional pace in January and changed little in February. Housing starts rose substantially in both months to the highest rate in several years. Information on outlays and spending plans generally suggests continuing strength in business fixed investment.  Prices rose somewhat faster in early 1984 than in the fourth quarter, with increases concentrated in the food sector. The index of average hourly earnings rose only slightly over the first two months of the year, although total compensation costs appear to have increased more rapidly.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies declined considerably from the end of January through the first week of March, but part of that decline was retraced more recently. The merchandise trade deficit rose sharply in January, mainly because of larger non-oil imports.  Data available through mid-March indicate that M1 and M3 have expanded somewhat more rapidly than anticipated at the previous meeting; since the fourth quarter of 1983, M1 and M3 are tentatively estimated to have grown at rates close to the upper limits of the Committee's ranges for 1984. Growth in M2 appears to have been less rapid than previously expected and was estimated to be at a rate in the lower part of its longer-run range. In January and February, growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt apparently rose at a pace substantially above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, and bank credit continued to expand at a relatively rapid rate. Interest rates have risen considerably since late January.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved-13- 3/26-27/84pattern of international transactions. The Committee established growth ranges for the broader aggregates of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. The Committee also considered that a range of 4 to 8 percent for M1 would be appropriate for the same period, taking account of the possibility that, in the light of the changed composition of Ml, its relationship to GNP over time may be shifting. Pending further experience, growth in that aggregate will need to be interpreted in the light of the growth in the other monetary aggregates, which for the time being would continue to receive substantial weight. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1984.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the short run the Committee seeks to maintain pressures on bank reserve positions judged to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of around 6-1/2, 8, and 8-1/2 percent, respectively, during the period from March to June. Greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates, while somewhat lesser restraint might be acceptable if growth of the monetary aggregates slowed significantly; in either case, such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the continuing strength of the business expansion, inflationary pressures and the rate of credit growth.  The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 22, 1984.The meeting adjourned.-14- 3/26-27/84 -15Secretary's Note: On April 18, 1984, by unanimous vote, Committee members approved an additional increase of $1 billion, to $7 billion, in the limit on changes between Committee meetings in System Account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities specified in paragraph 1(a) of the authorization for domestic open market operations, effective immediately, for the period ending with the close of business on May 22, 1984.
