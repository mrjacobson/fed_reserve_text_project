In the agenda for this meeting, it was reported that Loretta J. Mester had been elected a member of the Federal Open Market Committee and that she had executed her oath of office. Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed- In a joint session of the Federal Open Market Commit-tee (FOMC) and the Board of Governors of the Feder-al Reserve System, the deputy manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on develop-ments in domestic and foreign financial markets.  The SOMA manager reported on the System open market operations during the period since the Committee met on April 2930, 2014, outlined the testing of the Term Deposit Facility, described the results from the fixed-rate overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) operational exercise, and provided some possible op-tions for adjusting the list of counterparties eligible to participate in ON RRP operations.  The manager also noted the effects of recent foreign central bank policy actions on the yields on the international portion of the SOMA portfolio and discussed ongoing staff work on improving data collections regarding bank funding markets.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the intermeeting period.  There were no intervention c-count over the intermeeting period. Monetary Policy Normalization Meeting participants continued their discussion of is-sues associated with the eventual normalization of the stance and conduct of monetary policy.  The Commit-of prudent planning and did not imply that normaliza-tion would necessarily begin sometime soon.  A staff presentation included some possible strategies for im-plementing and communicating monetary policy during a period when the Federal Reserve will have a very large balance sheet.  In addition, the presentation out-lined design features of a potential ON RRP facility rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in agency MBS. Most participants agreed that adjustments in the rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER) should play a cen-tral role during the normalization process.  It was gen-erally agreed that an ON RRP facility with an interest rate set below the IOER rate could play a useful sup-     porting role by helping to firm the floor under money market interest rates.  One participant thought that the ON RRP rate would be the more effective policy tool during normalization in light of the wider variety of counterparties eligible to participate in ON RRP opera-tions.  The appropriate size of the spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates was discussed, with many participants judging that a relatively wide spreadperhaps near or above the current level of 20 basis pointswould support trading in the federal funds market and provide adequate control over market in-terest rates.  Several participants noted that the spread might be adjusted during the normalization process.  A couple of participants suggested that adequate control of short-term rates might be accomplished with a very wide spread or even without an ON RRP facility.  A few participants commented that the Committee should also be prepared to use its other policy tools, including term deposits and term reverse repurchase agreements, if necessary.  Most participants thought that the federal funds rate should continue to play a communications during normalization, with many of them indicating a preference for continuing to an-nounce a target range.  However, a few participants thought that, given the degree of uncertainty about the might be preferable to focus on an administered rate in communicating the stance of policy during the normal-ization period.  In addition, participants examined pos-sibilities for changing the calculation of the effective federal funds rate in order to obtain a more robust measure of overnight bank funding rates and to apply lessons from international efforts to develop improved standards for benchmark interest rates. While generally agreeing that an ON RRP facility could play an important role in the policy normalization pro-cess, participants discussed several potential unintended consequences of using such a facility and design fea-tures that could help to mitigate these consequences. Most participants expressed concerns that in times of investments toward the facility and away from financial and nonfinancial corporations, possibly causing disrup-tions in funding that could magnify the stress.  In addi-tion, a number of participants noted that a relatively large ON RRP facility had the potential to expand the role in financial intermediation and reshape the financial industry in ways that were difficult to anticipate.  Participants discussed design features that could address these concerns, including constraints on usage either in the aggregate or by counterparty and a relatively wide spread between the ON RRP rate and Several participants emphasized that, although the ON RRP rate would be useful in controlling short-term interest rates during normalization, they did not antici-pate that such a facility would be a permanent part of -run operating framework.  Fi-nally, a number of participants expressed concern about conducting monetary policy operations with nontraditional counterparties. Participants also discussed the appropriate time for over maturing Treasury securities at auction and rein-vesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  It was noted that, in the  reinvestment policy prior to the liftoff of the federal funds rate, at the time of liftoff, or sometime thereafter would be expected to have only limited implications for macroeconomic outcomeobjectives, or remittances to the Treasury.  Many par-ticipants agreed that ending reinvestments at or after the time of liftoff would be best, with most of these participants preferring to end them after liftoff.  These participants thought that an earlier change to the rein-vestment policy would involve risks to the economic outlook if it was seen as suggesting that the Committee was likely to tighten policy more rapidly than currently anticipated or if it had unexpectedly large effects in MBS markets; moreover, an early change could add time when it would be clearer to signal changes in poli-cy through interest rates alone.  However, some partic-ipants favored ending reinvestments prior to the first firming in policy interest rates, as stated in the Commit-Those participants thought that such an approach would avoid weakening the credibility of the Commit-arding normalization, would balance sheet, or would help prepare the public for the eventual rise in short-term interest rates.  Regardless of whether they preferred to introduce a change to the Comminitial tightening in short-term interest rates, a number of participants thought that it might be best to follow a graduated approach with respect to winding down re-investments or to manage reinvestments in a manner that would smooth the decline in the balance sheet.       Some stressed that the details should depend on finan-cial and economic conditions. Overall, participants generally expressed a preference for a simple and clear approach to normalization that would facilitate communication to the public and en-hance the credibility of monetary policy.  It was ob-served that it would be useful for the Committee to develop and communicate its plans to the public later this year, well before the first steps in normalizing poli-cy become appropriate.  Most participants indicated that they expected to learn more about the effects of proceeds, and many favored maintaining flexibility about the evolution of the normalization process as -run operating frame-work.  Participants requested additional analysis from the staff on issues related to normalization and agreed that it would be helpful to continue to review these issues at upcoming meetings.  The Board meeting con-cluded at the end of the discussion. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the June 1718 meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had dropped significantly early in the year but that econom-ic growth had bounced back in recent months.  The average pace of employment gains stepped up, and the unemployment rate declined markedly in April and held steady in May, although it was still elevated.  Consumer price inflation picked up in recent months, while measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. Most measures of labor market conditions improved in recent months.  Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in April and May at a faster rate than the av-erage monthly pace during the previous two quarters.  The unemployment rate dropped to 6.3 percent in April and remained at that level in May.  However, the labor force participation rate also declined in April and then held steady in May, while the employment-to-population ratio remained flat.  Both the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons and the rate of long-duration unemployment edged down in recent months, although both measures were still high.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance decreased slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period, and the rate of job openings stepped up in April; nevertheless, the rate of hiring was unchanged and remained at a modest level. Industrial production increased, on balance, in April and May, as manufacturing output and production in the mining sector expanded and more than offset a further decline in the output of utilities from the ele-vated levels recorded during the unusually cold winter months.  As a result, the rate of industrial capacity utili-zation rose in reindicated that the pace of light motor vehicle assem-blies would step up in the coming months, and broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from national manufacturing surveys, were consistent with moderate increases in factory output in the near term. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) de-clined a little in April following strong gains in Febru-ary and March.  The component of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE edged down in May, but light motor vehicle sales moved up briskly.  Recent in-formation about key factors that influence household spending mostly pointed to gains in PCE in the coming months.  Real disposable income continued to rise in equity prices and home values advanced further; how-ever, consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reu-ters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers moved down somewhat in May and early June. The pace of activity in the housing sector remained subdued.  Starts of new single-family homes declined slightly, on net, in April and May, although starts of multifamily units increased. Permits for single-family homes, which are usually a better indicator of the un-derlying pace of residential construction, increased only a little on balance.  Sales of new homes rose in April but remained near their average monthly level last year.  Existing home sales only edged up in April and were still below last sales were little changed. Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products were estimated to have increased slowly in the first quarter as a whole.  In April, nominal orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased a little after rising briskly in March.  However, the level of new or-ders for these capital goods remained above the level of shipments in April, pointing to increases in shipments in subsequent months.  Other forward-looking indica-tors, such as surveys of business conditions, were also generally consistent with modest increases in business equipment spending in the near term.  Nominal busi-ness spending for nonresidential structures was essen-tially unchanged in April.  Recent data on the book      value of inventories, along with readings on inventories from national and regional manufacturing surveys, did not point to significant inventory imbalances in most industries except in the energy sector, where invento-ries appeared unusually low after having been drawn down during the winter. Federal spending data for April and May pointed to-ward only a small decline in real federal government purchases in the second quarter, as the pace of decreas-es in defense expenditures seemed to ease.  Real state and local government purchases appeared to edge up going into the second quarter.  The payrolls of these governments expanded in April and May, and nominal state and local construction expenditures increased a little in April. The U.S. international trade deficit widened in March and in April.  Both imports and exports recovered from weak readings in February, with imports of consumer goods, automotive products, and capital goods rising significantly and exports of capital goods and industrial supplies showing particular strength. U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, was about 1½ percent over the 12 months -run ob-jective of 2 percent.  Over the same 12-month period, consumer energy prices rose faster than total consumer prices, while consumer food prices climbed more slow-ly than overall prices; core PCE inflationwhich ex-cludes food and energy priceswas also around       1½ percent.  In May, the consumer price index (CPI) increased at a faster pace than in the preceding few months; both food and energy prices rose more briskly, and core CPI inflation also stepped up.  Over the 12 months ending in May, both total and core CPI in-flation were about 2 percent.  Near-term inflation ex-pectations from the Michigan survey declined slightly, on balance, in May and early June, while longer-term inflation expectations from the survey were little changed. Increases in measures of labor compensation remained modest.  Compensation per hour in the nonfarm busi-ness sector rose about 2¼ percent over the year ending in the first quarter; with small gains in labor productivi-ty, unit labor costs advanced more slowly than com-pensation per hour.  Over the year ending in May, av-erage hourly earnings for all employees increased around 2 percent. Foreign real GDP growth slowed in the first quarter, especially in China and some other emerging market economies.  Real GDP also increased more slowly in Canada, in part because of severe winter weather, and the pace of economic activity remained weak in the euro area.  Economic growth continued to be strong in the United Kingdom, and economic activity jumped in Japan as household spending surged in advance of c-ond quarter generally suggested that foreign economic growth picked up from the first quarter.  In some ad-vanced foreign economies, inflation moved up recently from earlier low readings.  Inflation continued to be low, however, in the euro area, and the European Cen-tral Bank (ECB) announced additional stimulus measures. Staff Review of the Financial Situation On balance, financial conditions in the United States remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment:  The expected path of the federal funds rate was slightly lower in the long run, yields on longer-term Treasury securities moved down modestly, equity prices rose, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed. Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period had limited effects in financial markets.  The April FOMC statement and minutes appeared to be congressional testimony before the Joint Economic Committee in early May and the subsequent question-and-answer session were viewed by market participants as suggesting marginally more accommodative policy than expected. imary Deal-x-pectation about the most likely timing of the first in-crease in the federal funds rate target but showed a lower median longer-run level of the federal funds rate relative to the April survey.  Expectations for Federal Reserve asset purchases were largely unchanged.  In addition, although there was significant dispersion among dealer responses, the median dealer expected the FOMC to end its reinvestment of principal pay-ments on Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS sometime after the first increase in the federal funds rate target; in the April survey, the median dealer had expected reinvestments to end before liftoff. Yields on short- and medium-term nominal Treasury securities increased slightly, on balance, over the inter-meeting period.  In contrast, yields at the long end of the curve edged lower, continuing a downward trend      evident over much of this year.  Market participants continued to discuss the decreases in long forward rates since the beginning of the year and pointed to a variety of domestic and global factors possibly contributing to this trend, including lower expectations for potential growth and policy rates in the longer run, a decline in inflation risk premiums, purchases of longer-term secu-rities by price-insensitive investors, unwinding of short Treasury positions, and falling interest rate uncertainty.  Measures of longer-horizon inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities re-mained about steady. Conditions in unsecured short-term dollar funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period.  The Federal Reserve continued its ON RRP exercise.  Total take-up in the ON RRP exercise rose in April and May before falling back in June.  Much of the transitory increase in take-up occurred in response to a large sea-sonal reduction in outstanding Treasury debt and an associated drop in the rates on Treasury repurchase agreements during the first half of the second quarter that were reversed during the second half.  In May, the Federal Reserve began an eight-week series of test auc-tions of seven-day term deposits.  The number of par-ticipants and the total amount awarded increased over the course of the first five operations. Broad stock price indexes rose over the intermeeting period, apparently boosted by a more optimistic as-sessment of near-term economic prospects and likely supported by continued low interest rates.  Despite generally lackluster results for first-quarter earnings, corporate guidance for profits in coming quarters led to -ahead earnings per share for S&P 500 firms.  The VIX, an index of option-implied volatility for one-month re-turns on the S&P 500 index, continued to decline and ended the period near its historical lows.  Measures of uncertainty in other financial markets also declined; this development might have reflected low realized vol-atilities, generally favorable economic news, less uncer-tainty for the path of monetary policy, and complacen-cy on the part of market participants about potential risks. Credit flows to nonfinancial corporations remained strong.  Amid low yields and reduced market volatility, gross issuance of investment- and speculative-grade bonds rebounded in May.  Commercial and industrial (C&I) issuance of leveraged loans remained strong.  Respons-es to the June Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms indicated that investor de-mand for financing to fund purchases of collateralized loan obligations rose somewhat since the beginning of the year. Commercial real estate loans continued to increase amid some further easing of underwriting standards for commercial mortgages.  While issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities started the year a bit slow relative to 2013, it has picked up recently.  Bank and insurance company originations of commercial mort-gages expanded in the first quarter. Mortgage credit conditions generally remained tight, though further incremental signs of easing emerged amid continued gains in house prices.  Mortgage inter-est rates declined somewhat more than long-term Treasury yields over the intermeeting period, while  option-adjusted spreads on production-coupon MBS narrowed.  Both mortgage applications for home pur-chases and refinancing applications remained at very low levels. Conditions in consumer credit markets were solid in recent months.  Credit card loan balances increased.  Growth in student loans moderated further but re-mained solid, and outstanding auto loans continued to pick up.  Issuance of auto and credit card asset-backed securities was again robust. The expected path of ECB policy rates implied by mar-ket quotes for short-term interest rates fell over the intermeeting period, as investors anticipated the easing of policy announced by the ECB at its June meeting.  By contrast, late in the period, market participants in-terpreted statements by Bank of England Governor Carney as signaling an earlier tightening of policy than had been anticipated, and near-term policy rate expec-tations moved higher in response.  Benchmark sover-eign bond yields declined modestly in most countries, but U.K. gilt yields rose.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed, on balance, over the period, as the dollar appreciated against the euro but declined against the Canadian dollar and many emerg-ing market currencies.  Consistent with some im-provement in investor sentiment toward risky assets, foreign equity prices generally rose over the intermeet-ing period, and foreign sovereign and corporate bond spreads narrowed.  In addition, both bond and equity emerging market mutual funds saw net inflows over the period.      Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the first half of this year as a whole was lower, on net, than in the projection for the April meeting.  In particular, the available readings on exports, inventory investment, outlays for health-care services, and construction pointed to much weaker real GDP in the first quarter than the staff had expected.  However, the staff still anticipated that real GDP growth would rebound brisk-ly in the second quarter, consistent with recent indica-tors for consumer spending and business investment, along with the expectation that exports and inventory investment would return to more normal levels and that economic activity that had been restrained by the severe winter weather would bounce back.  Primarily because of the combination of recent downward sur-prises in the unemployment rate and weaker-than-expected real GDP, the staff slightly lowered its as-sumed pace of potential output growth this year and next and slightly decreased its assumption for the natu-ral rate of unemployment over this same period.  As a -term forecast for real GDP growth was revised down a little on balance.  Neverthe-less, the staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a faster pace in the second half of this year and over the next two years than it did last year and that it would rise more quickly than potential output.  The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by diminishing drag on spending from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability, and a pickup in the rate of foreign econom-ic growth.  The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was ex-pected to decline gradually longer-run natural rate in the medium term.  In the longer-run outlook, the staff slightly lowered its as-sumptions for real GDP growth and the level of equi-librium real interest rates. revised up a little as recent data showed somewhat fast-er increases in consumer prices than anticipated.  How-ever, the medium-term projection for inflation was re-vised down slightly, reflecting a reassessment by the staff of the underlying trend in inflation.  The staff con-tinued to forecast that inflation would remain below -run objective of 2 percent over the next few years.  With longer-run inflation expecta-tions assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be subdued, and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to diminish slowly, inflation was projected to rise gradually toward o-c-tive in the longer run. were somewhat different from the forecasts presented at the March meeting, when the FOMC last prepared a June projections for the unemployment rate, real GDP growth, and inflation over the next few years were all a little lower, on balance, than those in its March fore-cast. The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its June projections for real GDP growth and the unem-ployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years.  Nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, as neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was seen as being well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.  At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemploy-ment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced. Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, the meeting participants submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the tar-get federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2016 and over the longer run, under each judgment of appropriate monetary policy.3  The longer-of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the SEP, which is attached as an adden-dum to these minutes. In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was rebounding in the second quar-                                                 3 Four members of the Board of Governors and the presi-dents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks submitted projections.  Governor Brainard took office on June 16, 2014, and partic-ipated in the June 1718, 2014, meeting; she was not able to submit economic projections.      ter following a surprisingly large decline in real GDP in the first quarter of the year.  Labor market conditions generally improved further.  Although participants marked down their expectations for average growth of real GDP over the first half of 2014, their projections beginning in the second half of 2014 changed little.  Over the next two and a half years, they continued to expect economic activity to expand at a rate sufficient to lead to a further decline in the unemployment rate to levels close to their current assessments of its longer-run normal value.  Among the factors anticipated to support the sustained economic expansion were ac-commodative monetary policy, diminished drag from fiscal restraint, further gains in household net worth, improving credit conditions for households and busi-nesses, and rising employment and wages.  While infla-tion was still seen as longer-run objective, longer-run inflation expectations remained stable and the Committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its 2 percent objec-tive over the forecast period.  Most participants viewed the risks to the outlook for the economy, the labor market, and inflation as broadly balanced. Household spending appeared to have risen moderate-ly, on balance, in recent months, with sales of motor vehicles, in particular, rising strongly.  However, several participants read the recent soft information on retail sales and health-care spending as raising some concern about the underlying strength in consumer spending.  A couple of participants noted that, to date, consumer spending had been supported importantly by gains in household net worth while income gains had been held back by only modest increases in wages.  In their view, an important element in the economic outlook was a pickup in income, from higher wages as well as ongo-ing employment gains, that would be expected to sup-port a sustained rise in consumer spending. The recovery in the housing sector was reported to have remained slow in all but a few areas of the coun-try.  Many participants expressed concern about the still-soft indicators of residential construction, and they discussed a range of factors that might be contributing to either a temporary delay in the housing recovery or a persistently lower level of homebuilding than previous-ly anticipated.  Despite attractive mortgage rates, hous-ing demand was seen as being damped by such factors as restrictive credit conditions, particularly for house-holds with low credit scores; high down payments; or low demand among younger homebuyers, due in part to the burden of student loan debt.  Others noted sup-ply constraints, pointing to shortages of lots, low inven-tories of desirable homes for sale, an overhang of homes associated with foreclosures or seriously delin-quent mortgages, or rising construction costs.  Several other participants suggested the possibility that more persistent structural changes in housing demand associ-ated with an aging population and evolving lifestyle preferences were boosting demand for multifamily units at the expense of single-family homes. sug-gested capital spending was likely to increase going forward.  Contacts in a number of Districts reported that they were generally optimistic about the business outlook, although in a couple of regions respondents remained cautious about prospects for stronger eco-nomic growth or worried about a renewal of federal fiscal restraint after the current congressional budget agreement expires.  Among the industries cited as rela-tively strong in recent months were transportation, en-ergy, telecommunications, and manufacturing, particu-larly motor vehicles.  Some participants commented that their contacts in small and medium-sized business-es reported an improved outlook for sales, and several heard businesses more generally discuss plans to in-crease capital expenditures.  One participant noted that District businesses were investing largely to meet re-placement needs, while another suggested that the backlog of such needs would likely provide some impe-tus to business investment. Favorable financial conditions appeared be supporting economic activity.  While information about mortgage lending was mixed, a number of participants reported increases in C&I lending by banks in their Districts, a pickup in loan demand at banks, or better credit quality for borrowers.  In addition, small businesses reported improvements in credit availability.  However, partici-pants also discussed whether some recent trends in financial markets might suggest that investors were not appropriately taking account of risks in their invest-ment decisions.  In particular, low implied volatility in equity, currency, and fixed-income markets as well as signs of increased risk-taking were viewed by some par-ticipants as an indication that market participants were not factoring in sufficient uncertainty about the path of the economy and monetary policy.  They agreed that the Committee should continue to carefully monitor financial conditions and to emphasize in its communi-cations the dependence of its policy decisions on the evolution of the economic outlook; it was also pointed out that, where appropriate, supervisory measures should be applied to address excessive risk-taking and associated financial imbalances.  At the same time, it      was noted that monetary policy needed to continue to promote the favorable financial conditions required to support the economic expansion. In discussing economic developments abroad, a couple of participants noted that recent monetary policy ac-tions by the ECB and the Bank of Japan had improved the outlook for economic activity in those areas and could help return inflation to target.  Several others, however, remained concerned that persistent low infla-tion in Europe and Japan could eventually erode infla-tion expectations more broadly.  And a couple of par-ticipants expressed uncertainty about the outlook for economic growth in Japan and China.  In addition, sev-eral saw developments in Iraq and Ukraine as posing possible downside risks to global economic activity or potential upside risks to world oil prices. Labor market conditions generally continued to im-prove over the intermeeting period.  That improvement was evidenced by the decline in the unemployment rate as well as by changes in other indicators, such as solid gains in nonfarm payrolls, a low level of new claims for unemployment insurance, uptrends in quits and job openings, and more positive views of job availability by households.  In assessing labor market conditions, par-ticipants again offered a range of views on how far conditions in the labor market were from those associ-ated with maximum employment.  Many judged that slack remained elevated, and a number of them thought it was greater than measured by the official unemploy-ment rate, citing, in particular, the still-high level of workers employed part time for economic reasons or the depressed labor force participation rate.  Even so, several participants pointed out that both long- and short-term unemployment and measures that include marginally attached workers had declined.  Most partic-ipants projected the improvement in labor market con-ditions to continue, with the unemployment rate mov-ing down gradually over the medium term.  However, a couple of participants anticipated that the decline in unemployment would be damped as part-time workers shift to full-time jobs and as nonparticipants rejoin the labor force, while a few others commented that they expected no lasting reversal of the decline in labor force participation. Aggregate wage measures continued to rise at only a modest rate, and reports on wages from business con-tacts and surveys in a number of Districts were mixed.  Several of those reports pointed to an absence of wage pressures, while some others indicated that tight labor markets or shortages of skilled workers were leading to upward pressure on wages in some areas or occupa-tions and that an increasing proportion of small busi-nesses were planning to raise wages.  Participants dis-cussed the prospects for wage increases to pick up as slack in the labor market diminishes.  Several noted that a return to growth in real wages in line with productivi-ty growth would provide welcome support for house-hold spending. Readings on a range of price measuresincluding the PCE price index, the CPI, and a number of the analyti-cal measures developed at the Reserve Banksappeared to provide evidence that inflation had moved up recently from low levels earlier in the year, con-sistent with n-crease in inflation over the medium term.  Reports from business contacts were mixed, spanning an ab-sence of price pressures in some Districts and rising input costs in others.  Some participants expressed concern about the persistence of below-trend inflation, and a couple of them suggested that the Committee may need to allow the unemployment rate to move below its longer-run normal level for a time in order keep inflation expectations anchored and return infla-tion to its 2 percent target, though one participant em-phasized the risks of doing so.  In contrast, some oth-ers expected a faster pickup in inflation or saw upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations because they anticipated a more rapid decline in economic slack. During their consideration of issues related to mone-tary policy over the medium term, participants generally likely path of its asset purchases and about its approach to determining the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and the path of the policy rate there-after.  Participants offered views on a range of issues related to policy communications.  Some participants suggested that  communications about its forward guidance should emphasize more strongly that its policy decisions would depend on its ongoing assessment across a range of indicators of economic activity, labor market conditions, inflation and inflation expectations, and financial market developments.  In that regard, circumstances that might entail either a slower or a more rapid removal of policy accommoda-tion were cited.  For example, a number of participants noted their concern that a more gradual approach might be appropriate if forecasts of above-trend eco-nomic growth later this year were not realized.  And a couple suggested that the Committee might need to strengthen its commitment to maintain sufficient policy accommodation to return inflation to its target over the      medium term in order to prevent an undesirable de-cline in inflation expectations.  Alternatively, some oth-er participants expressed concern that economic growth over the medium run might be faster than cur-rently expected or that the rate of growth of potential output might be lower than currently expected, calling for a more rapid move to begin raising the federal funds rate in order to avoid significantly overshooting unemployment and inflation objec-tives. While the current asset purchase program is not on a preset course, participants generally agreed that if the economy evolved as they anticipated, the program would likely be completed later this year.  Some com-mittee members had been asked by members of the public whether, if tapering in the pace of purchases continues as expected, the final reduction would come in a single $15 billion per month reduction or in a    $10 billion reduction followed by a $5 billion reduction.  Most participants viewed this as a technical issue with no substantive macroeconomic consequences and no consequences for the eventual decision about the tim-ing of the first increase in the federal funds ratea decision that will assessments of actual and expected progress toward its objectives.  In light of these considerations, participants generally agreed that if incoming information continued to support its expectation of improvement in labor market conditions and a return of inflation toward its longer-run objective, it would be appropriate to com-plete asset purchases with a $15 billion reduction in the pace of purchases in order to avoid having the small, remaining level of purchases receive undue focus among investors.  If the economy progresses about as the Committee expects, warranting reductions in the pace of purchases at each upcoming meeting, this final reduction would occur following the October meeting. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indi-cated that economic activity was rebounding from the decline in the first quarter of the year.  Labor market indicators generally showed further improvement.  The unemployment rate, though lower, remained elevated.  Household spending appeared to be rising moderately and business fixed investment resumed its advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow.  Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, alt-hough the extent of restraint was diminishing.  The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy ac-commodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would con-tinue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  Members saw the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation was -run objective, but the Committee anticipated that with stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity, infla-tion r-cent objective.  However, members continued to rec-ognize that inflation persistently below its longer-run objective could pose risks to economic performance and agreed to monitor inflation developments closely for evidence that inflation was moving back toward its objective over the medium term. Members judged that the economy had sufficient un-derlying strength to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and a return of inflation to--run 2 percent objective, and thus agreed that a further measured reduction in p-propriate at this meeting.  Accordingly, the Committee agreed that beginning in July, it would add to its hold-ings of agency MBS at a pace of $15 billion per month rather than $20 billion per month, and it would add to its holdings of Treasury securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than $25 billion per month.  Members again judged that, if incoming in-formation broadly supported a-tions for ongoing progress toward meeting its dual ob-jectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent, the Committee would likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.  The Committee reiterated, however, that purchases were not on a preset course, and that its de-cisions about the pace of purchases would remain con-tingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. The Committee agreed to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate and to reiterate its forward guid-ance about how it would assess the appropriate timing of the first increase in the target rate and the anticipat-ed behavior of the federal funds rate after it is raised.  The guidance continued to emphasize that the Com-r-rent target range for the federal funds rate would de-pend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  The Committee again stated that it      currently anticipated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset pur-chase program ends, especially if projected inflation continued  percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term infla-tion expectations remained well anchored.  The for-ta-tion that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price sta-bility.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  Beginning in July, the Desk is directed to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $20 billion per month and to purchase agency mortgage-backed securi-ties at a pace of about $15 billion per month.  The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate mortgage-backed securities transactions.  The Committee directs the Desk to main-tain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securi-ties.  The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing develop-that could affect the attainment over time  The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-low to be released at 2:00 p.m.: Open Market Committee met in April indi-cates that growth in economic activity has rebounded in recent months.  Labor market indicators generally showed further im-provement.  The unemployment rate, though lower, remains elevated.  Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment resumed its advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow.  Fiscal policy is re-straining economic growth, although the ex-tent of restraint is diminishing.  Inflation longer-run objective, but longer-term infla-tion expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum em-ployment and price stability.  The Commit-tee expects that, with appropriate policy ac-commodation, economic activity will ex-pand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradu-ally, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the out-look for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced. The Committee recog-nizes that inflation persistently below its     2 percent objective could pose risks to eco-nomic performance, and it is monitoring in-flation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its ob-jective over the medium term. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing im-provement in labor market conditions.  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improve-ment in the outlook for labor market condi-tions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in Ju-ly, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $15 billion per month rather than      $20 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than $25 billion per month.  The Commit-tee is maintaining its existing policy of rein-vesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securi-ties and of rolling over maturing Treasury z-able and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, sup-port mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accom-modative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to en-sure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incom-ing information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and em-ploy its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  If incoming information broadly ongoing improvement in labor market con-ditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.  However, asset purchases are not on a pre-about their pace will remain contingent on r-ket and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such pur-chases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. In de-termining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess pro-gressboth realized and expectedtoward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of infor-mation, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assess-ment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a con-siderable time after the asset purchase pro-gram ends, especially if projected inflation     2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its long-er-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee cur-rently anticipates that, even after employ-ment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Commit- Voting for this action:  Janet L.

English Secretary     Summary of Economic Projections  In conjunction with the June 1718, 2014, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting participants submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the tar-get federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2016 and over the longer run.1   as-sessment was based on information available at the time of the meeting plus his or her judgment of appro-priate monetary policy and assumptions about the fac-tors likely to affect economic outcomes.

Consistent with that outlook, the unemployment rate was projected to continue to decline toward its longer-run normal level over the projection period (table 1 and figure 1).  The majority of participants projected that inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would rise to a lobjective in 2016. The majority of participants expected that highly ac-commodative monetary policy would remain appropri-ate over the next few years to foster progress toward -run objectives.  As shown in figure 2, all but one of the participants anticipated that it would be appropriate to wait at least until 2015 before beginning to increase the federal funds rate, and most projected that it would then be appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate fairly gradually.  Giv-en their economic outlooks, most participants judged that it would be appropriate to continue gradually slow--term securities and complete the asset purchase pro-gram later this year.

In addition, most participants considered the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth and the un-employment rate to be broadly balanced, and a majority saw the risks to inflation as broadly balanced.  Howev-er, some saw the risks to their forecasts for economic growth or inflation as tilted to the downside, and a couple saw the risks to their forecasts for inflation as tilted to the upside. The Outlook for Economic Activity Participants generally projected that, conditional on their individual assumptions about appropriate mone-tary policy, real GDP growth would pick up notably in the second half of this year and remain in 2015 and 2016 above their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of output growth.  All participants revised down their projections of real GDP growth for the first half of 2014 compared with their projections in March, but most left their forecasts for the remainder of the pro-jection period largely unchanged.  Participants generally judged that real GDP growth in the first half of this year was held down by transitory factors depressing output early in the year, and they pointed to a number of factors that they expected would continue to con-tribute to a pickup in economic growth later this year and next, including rising household net worth, dimin-ished restraint from fiscal policy, improving labor mar-ket conditions, and highly accommodative monetary policy.  The central tendencies of projec-tions for real GDP growth were 2.1 to 2.3 percent in 2014, 3.0 to 3.2 percent in 2015, and 2.5 to 3.0 percent in 2016.  The central tendency for the longer-run nor-mal rate of growth of real GDP was 2.1 to 2.3 percent, only slightly lower than in March. Participants continued to anticipate a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the projection period.  unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 6.0 to 6.1 percent in 2014, 5.4 to 5.7 percent in 2015, and 5.1 to 5.5 percent in 2016.  Nearly all partici-pants revised down their projected paths for the unem-ployment rate this year and next relative to their March projections, with the majority pointing to the decline in the unemployment rate in recent months as a reason for the downward revision.  The central tendency of -run normal rate of unemployment that would prevail under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy also edged down, to 5.2 to 5.5 percent.  Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would be close to their individual estimates of its longer-run level at the end of 2016. Figures 3.A and 3.B show that participants continued to hold a range of views regarding the likely outcomes for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over the next two years.  The diversity of views reflected their individual assessments of the rate at which the headwinds that have been holding back the pace of the economic recovery would abate and of the anticipated path for foreign economic activity, the trajectory for growth in household net worth, and the appropriate path of monetary policy.  Relative to March, the disper-real GDP growth narrowed a bit in 2014 but was largely unchanged over the next two years, and the dispersion of projections for the unemployment rate over the entire projection period was little changed. The Outlook for Inflation Compared with March, the central tendencies of partic-for all years in the projection period, although many participants marked up a bit their projections for infla-tion in 2014.  The vast majority of participants antici-pated that, on average, both headline and core inflation would rise gradually over the next few years, and the majority of participants expected headline inflation to b-jective in 2016.  Specifically, the central tendencies for PCE inflation were 1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014, 1.5 to 2.0 percent in 2015, and 1.6 to 2.0 percent in 2016.  The central tendencies of the forecasts for core infla-tion were broadly similar to those for the headline measure.  It was noted that some combination of stable inflation expectations and steadily diminishing resource slack was likely to contribute to a gradual rise of infla--run objective of 2 percent. Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the diver-a-tion.  Tinflation were little changed relative to March.  The forecasts for PCE inflation in 2016 were at or below -run objective.  Similar to the projections for headline inflation, the projections for core inflation in 2016 were concentrated at or below    2 percent. Appropriate Monetary Policy As indicated in figure 2, nearly all participants judged that low levels of the federal funds rate would remain appropriate for the next few years.  In particular,        12 participants thought that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would not be warranted until sometime in 2015, and 3 judged that policy firming  Figure3.A.Distributionofparticipants'projectionsforthechangeinrealGDP,2014{16andoverthelongerrun2014Number of participants24681012141618201.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 2.7 2.9 3.1 3.3 3.5 3.7 Percent rangeJune projectionsMarch projections2015Number of participants24681012141618201.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 2.7 2.9 3.1 3.3 3.5 3.7 Percent range2016Number of participants24681012141618201.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 2.7 2.9 3.1 3.3 3.5 3.7 Percent rangeLonger runNumber of participants24681012141618201.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 2.7 2.9 3.1 3.3 3.5 3.7 Percent rangeNote:Dnitionsofvariablesareinthegeneralnotetotable1.

Only 1 par-ticipant thought that an increase in the federal funds rate would be warranted in 2014. All participants projected that the unemployment rate would be below 6 percent at the end of the year in which they judged the initial increase in the federal funds rate to be warranted, and all but one anticipated longer-run objective at that time.  Most participants projected that the unemployment rate would remain above their estimates of its longer-run normal level at the end of the year in which they saw the federal funds rate increasing from its effective lower bound. judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year from 2014 to 2016 and over the longer run.  As noted earlier, nearly all participants judged that economic conditions would warrant maintaining the current exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate at least until 2015.  Relative to their projections in March, the median val-ues of the federal funds rate at the end of 2015 and 2016 increased 13 basis points and 25 basis points to 1.13 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively, while the mean values rose 7 basis points and 11 basis points to 1.18 percent and 2.53 percent, respectively.  The dis-persion of projections for the value of the federal funds rate was little changed in 2015 but widened slightly in 2016.  Most participants expected that the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 would still be significantly below their individual assessments of its longer-run level.  For about half of these participants, the low level of the federal funds rate at that time was associated with infla-tion well below 2 percent objective.  In contrast, the rest of these participants saw the feder-al funds rate at the end of 2016 as still significantly low despite their projections that the unemployment rate would be close to or below their individual longer-run projections and inflation would be at or close to 2 per-cent at that time.  These participants cited some com-bination of a lower equilibrium real interest rate, con-tinuing headwinds from the financial crisis and subse-quent recession, and a desire to raise the federal funds rate at a gradual pace after liftoff as explanations for the still-low level of the projected federal funds rate at the end of 2016.  A couple of participants also men-tioned broader measures of labor market slack that may take longer to return to their normal levels than the unemployment rate.  Estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate ranged from 3¼ to about    4¼ c-regarding the appropriate longer-run level of the real federal funds rate in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  Compared with March, some partici-pants revised down their estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate, with a lower assessment of the long-er-run level of potential output growth cited as a con-tributing factor for the majority of those revisions.  As a result, the median estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate shifted down to 3.75 percent from 4 percent in March, while its mean value declined 11 basis points to 3.78 percent. Participants also described their views regarding the Conditional on their respective economic outlooks, most participants judged that it would be appropriate to continue to reduce the pace of the Cr-chases of longer-term securities in measured steps and to conclude the purchases later this year.  A couple of participants judged that a more rapid reduction in the pace of purchases and an earlier end to the asset pur-chase program would be appropriate. e-tary policy were informed by their judgments about the state of the economy, including the values of the un-employment rate and other labor market indicators that would be consistent with maximum employment, the extent to which the economy was currently falling short of maximum employment, the prospects for inflation to return to -term objective of  2 percent, and the balance of risks around the outlook.  Many participants also mentioned the prescriptions of various monetary policy rules as factors they consid-ered in judging the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. Uncertainty and Risks The vast majority of participants continued to judge the levels of uncertainty about their projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar to the norms during the previous 20 years (fig-ure 4).  Most participants continued to judge the risks to real GDP growth and the unemployment rate to be                                                    Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 1994 through 2013.

Similar to March, nearly all participants continued to judge the risks to the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced. Almost all participants saw the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks around their forecasts for overall PCE inflation and core inflation as little changed from March.  Most participants continued to judge the levels of uncertainty associated with their forecasts for the two inflation measures to be broadly similar to histori-cal norms, and a majority continued to see the risks to those projections as broadly balanced.  A few partici-pants, however, viewed the risks to their inflation fore-casts as tilted to the downside, reflecting, for example, the possibilities that the recent low levels of inflation could prove more persistent than anticipated, and that the upward pull on prices from inflation expectations might be weaker than assumed.  Conversely, two par-ticipants saw upside risks to inflation, with one citing uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Com-accommodation.    Table 2.

Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts.  Projection is percent change, fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.             Forecast Uncertainty    The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understand-ing of the basis for policy actions.  Consider-able uncertainty attends these projections, however.  The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce eco-nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect de-scriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myr-iad unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Federal Open Market Committee.  The pro-jection error ranges shown in the table il-lustrate the considerable uncertainty associat-ed with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, re-spectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty attending those projections is simi-lar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP  would expand  within a range of  1.6  to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 5.0 per-cent in the second year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year.  The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year and    1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over his-tory, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their pro-jections of each variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty in the past, as shown in table 2.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, participants judge whether each variable is more likely to be above or below their projec-tions of the most likely outcome.  These judg-ments about the uncertainty and the risks at-s-about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast un-certainty is concerned with the risks associated with a particular projection rather than with divergences across a number of different pro-jections. As with real activity and inflation, the out-look for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each partic-ipants assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve in an un-expected manner, then assessments of the ap-propriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward.
