Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.-11 - 3/28/89 -12 3. The Manager for Foreign Operations shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System, and about any operations that are not of a routine character.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 7-8, 1989, were approved.  By unanimous vote, System Open Market transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 8 through March 27, 1989, were ratified By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in government securities and agency obligations during the period February 8 through March 27, 1989, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $6 billion to $8 billion the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System Account holdings of U.S.  government and federal agency securities for the intermeeting period ending May 16, 1989.  With Ms. Seger dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that activity in the nonfarm economy has expanded appreciably further in the current quarter. After strong gains in the fourth quarter, total nonfarm payroll employment rose markedly further in January and February. The civilian unemployment rate fell considerably to 5.1 percent in February. Industrial production was unchanged in February after rising substantially over the previous several months. After a weather-related surge in January, housing starts fell in February to a level somewhat below their average in the fourth quarter. Growth in consumer spending moderated in January and February. Recent indicators of business capital spending suggest a 3/28/89rebound after a decline in the fourth quarter. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was larger in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter; the preliminary estimate of the deficit for January was smaller than the average for the fourth quarter. The latest information on prices suggests some pickup in inflation from recent trends.  Interest rates in both short- and long-term markets have risen considerably since the Committee meeting in early February. On February 24 the Federal Reserve Board approved an increase in the discount rate from 6-1/2 to 7 percent. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose somewhat on balance over the intermeeting period.  Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in February and apparently picked up further in March; over the first quarter such expansion was about in line with Committee expectations. M1 appears to have declined marginally since December.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 3 to 7 percent and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in their velocities, developments in the economy and financial markets, and progress toward price level stability.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign-13 - 3/28/89-14 -exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of about 3 and 5 percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 8 to 12 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 16, 1989.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
