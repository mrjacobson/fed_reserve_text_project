By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period December 18, 1973, through January 21, 1974, were approved, 1/22/74ratified, and confirmed.  With Messrs. Hayes and Francis dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that growth in real output of goods and services was slow in the fourth quarter of 1973, in part because of the fuel situation. Prices continued to rise sharply in December, reflecting additional increases for petroleum products and widespread advances among other goods and services. A further weakening in activity and sharp rise in prices appear to be in prospect for early 1974. In December nonfarm payroll employment changed little and the unemployment rate increased further. Wage rates have continued to rise substantially in recent months, although not so sharply as prices.  Major foreign currencies have depreciated further against the dollar since mid-December, and some foreign monetary authorities have continued to sell dollars in exchange markets. Steep price increases imposed by oil-producing countries have heightened fears of economic disruption in many countries and of large and erratic international flows of funds.  The narrowly defined money stock increased substantially in the last 2 months of 1973, partly reflecting increased foreign deposits, but it has changed little on balance over recent weeks. Net inflows of consumer-type time deposits remained sizable at both banks and nonbank thrift institutions. Bank credit expansion, which was moderate over the closing months of 1973, has accelerated in recent weeks as banks have stepped up issuance of large-denomination CD's.  Since mid-December, interest rate movements have been mixed; yields on most long-term securities and on Treasury bills have risen on balance, while some private short-term rates have declined. 1/22/74In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, cushioning the effects on production and employment growing out of the oil shortage, and maintaining equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing and of international and domestic financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Wednesday, February 20, 1974.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
