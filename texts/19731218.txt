A further weakening in activity and an appreciable rise in prices are in prospect because of the curtailment in oil supplies. In November nonfarm payroll employment expanded further, but the unemployment rate, which had dropped in October, rose again to about the level that had prevailed since midyear. Wholesale prices of industrial commodities continued to rise sharply in November, reflecting large additional increases for petroleum products and widespread advances among other commodities; farm and food prices declined further.  In nearly all industrial countries abroad, concern has grown that a sustained cut in oil supplies will disrupt economic activity. Major foreign currencies have depreciated further against the dollar, and intervention sales of dollars by foreign monetary authorities have continued. The U.S. merchandise trade balance registered a strong surplus in the September-October period.  The narrowly defined money stock, following little net change over the third quarter, has grown at a relatively rapid pace over the past 2 months. Growth in the more broadly defined money stock has also been substantial, as net inflows at banks of consumer-type time deposits have been large. Net deposit inflows at nonbank thrift institutions improved somewhat further. Bank credit expansion remained moderate in November, although business loans increased after 2 months of little or no growth.  On December 7 the Federal Reserve announced a reduction from 11 to 8 per cent in marginal reserve requirements 12/17-18/73on large-denomination CD's. Most short-term market interest rates have declined somewhat on balance in recent weeks, while movements in long-term market rates have been mixed.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, cushioning the effects on production and employment growing out of the oil shortage, and maintaining equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of international and domestic financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve some easing in bank reserve and money market conditions, provided that the monetary aggregates do not appear to be growing excessively.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, January 22, 1974, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
