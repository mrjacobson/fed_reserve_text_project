The Committee anticipated finalization of the Rules after any appropriate changes were incorporated based on comments received from the public during the 60-day comment period following the Federal Register notice. Secretary's note:  The amended Rules were published in the Federal Register on December 27, 2016. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in U.S. and global financial markets during the period since the Committee met on November 1Œ2, 2016.  Nominal yields on longer-term U.S. Treasury securities rose substantially over the period, reflecting both higher real yields and an increase in inflation compensation.  The value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets rose, U.S. equity indexes in-creased considerably, and credit spreads on U.S. corpo-rate bonds narrowed.  Market pricing and survey results indicated that market participants had come to see a high probability of an increase of 25 basis points in the FOMC's target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and that the path of the federal funds rate an-ticipated by market participants for coming years had steepened.  Surveys of market participants indicated that revised expectations for government spending and tax policy following the U.S. elections in early November were seen as the most important reasons, among several factors, for the increase in longer-term Treasury yields, the climb in equity valuations, and the rise in the dollar. The manager also reported on developments in money markets and open market operations.  Market interest rates on overnight repurchase agreements (repos) fell during the intermeeting period.  Market participants pointed to a number of factors contributing to the de-cline, including lower demands for funding by securities dealers and the ample availability of financing from gov-ernment-only money market funds (MMFs).  The de-cline in repo rates, together with the shift of MMF assets toward government-only funds, had likely boosted usage of the System's overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility over the period.  In contrast to the decline in interest rates for secured money market trans-5 The approved Rules Regarding Availability of Information are available at www.federalreserve.gov/monetary policy/rules_authorizations.htm.    actions, the effective federal funds rate generally re-mained near the middle of the FOMC's ¼ to ½ percent target range.  The manager also reported on the Open Market Desk's regular review of operational readiness for a range of open market operations. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-cies for the System's account during the intermeeting pe-riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the December 13Œ14 meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) was expanding at a moderate pace over the sec-ond half of the year and that labor market conditions had continued to strengthen in recent months.  Consumer price inflation increased further above its pace early in the year but was still running below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-en-ergy imports. Taken together, a range of recent indicators showed that labor market conditions had tightened further.  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a solid pace in October and November, and the unemployment rate de-clined, reaching 4.6 percent in November.  The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons de-creased; however, both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio edged down on net.  The rates of private-sector job openings, of hiring, and of quits were generally little changed in September and October at levels above those seen during much of the current economic expansion.  The four-week mov-ing average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained low.  Labor productivity in the busi-ness sector was flat over the four quarters ending in the third quarter.  Measures of labor compensation contin-ued to rise at a moderate rate.  Compensation per hour in the business sector rose 3 percent over the four quar-ters ending in the third quarter, and average hourly earn-ings for all employees increased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in November.  The unemployment rates for African Americans, for Hispanics, and for whites all declined in recent months.  The unemploy-ment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics re-mained above the rate for whites but were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession. Total industrial production was flat in October.  Both manufacturing production and mining output increased, but the output of utilities declined markedly because of unseasonably warm weather in October.  Automakers' assembly schedules suggested that motor vehicle pro-duction would be roughly flat in the near term, and broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional man-ufacturing surveys, pointed toward only modest gains in factory output in the coming months. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-peared to be rising at a moderate pace in the fourth quar-ter.  Consumer expenditures increased modestly in Oc-tober but were restrained by a decline in spending for energy services that reflected unseasonably warm weather in that month.  Unit sales of light motor vehicles were higher in October and November than average monthly sales in the third quarter.  The components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Eco-nomic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE rose moderately in November.  Recent readings on key fac-tors that influence consumer spending-such as contin-ued gains in employment, real disposable personal in-come, and households' net worth-were consistent with moderate real PCE growth for the fourth quarter as a whole.  In addition, consumer sentiment as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers moved higher in November and early December. Recent information on housing market activity sug-gested that real residential investment was picking up in the fourth quarter after decreasing in the previous two quarters.  Starts for both new single-family homes and multifamily units rose substantially in October.  Building permit issuance for new single-family homes-which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in construction-also increased.  Sales of existing homes advanced, although new home sales dipped. Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-tellectual property seemed to be soft early in the fourth quarter.  Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft edged down in October.  How-ever, new orders of these capital goods rose and were running above the level of shipments, suggesting a pickup in business spending for equipment in the near term.  Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential structures declined in October, but the number of oil and gas rigs in operation, an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector, continued to edge up through early December. Real government purchases looked to be rising modestly in the fourth quarter.  Nominal federal government spending in October and November pointed to in-creases in real defense purchases in the fourth quarter.     The payrolls of state and local governments expanded, on balance, in October and November, and nominal construction spending by these governments rose in Oc-tober. The U.S. international trade deficit widened in October after narrowing in September.  After increasing in Sep-tember, exports fell substantially in October, reflecting declines in exports of agricultural products, consumer goods, and industrial supplies.  Imports in October re-traced their September decline, as imports of consumer goods and capital goods rose.  The available trade data suggested that real net exports would make a negative contribution to real U.S. GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased almost 1½ percent over the 12 months ending in October, partly restrained by recent decreases in consumer food prices and earlier declines in consumer energy prices.  Core PCE prices, which ex-clude food and energy prices, rose about 1¾ percent over the same period, held down in part by decreases in the prices of non-energy imports over a portion of this period and by the pass-through of earlier declines in en-ergy prices into the prices of other goods and services.  Over the same 12-month period, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose a bit more than 1½ percent, while core CPI inflation was around 2 percent.  The Michigan survey measure of me-dian longer-run inflation expectations edged up, on net, in November and early December.  The measure of longer-run inflation expectations for PCE prices from the Survey of Professional Forecasters was unchanged in the fourth quarter, and measures of longer-run infla-tion expectations from the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were also un-changed in December. Foreign real GDP growth rebounded in the third quarter from an unusually subdued pace in the second quarter.  This bounceback was driven primarily by stronger eco-nomic growth in Canada and Mexico, two countries where the second-quarter weakness was most pro-nounced.  In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), recent indicators were consistent with a more moderate pace of economic activity in the fourth quarter.  Eco-nomic growth also appeared to slow after its uptick in the third quarter in the emerging market economies (EMEs), as indicators for Mexico suggested a return to a more sustainable pace of economic growth and as in-vestment decelerated in China.  Inflation increased in most AFEs in recent months but remained significantly below central bank targets.  Inflation in the EMEs also moved up, driven largely by a rebound in Chinese food prices and, in some countries, by the effects of currency depreciation. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, incoming U.S. economic data and Federal Reserve communications reinforced market participants' expectations for an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the December meeting.  Asset price movements as well as changes in the expected path for U.S. monetary policy beyond De-cember appeared to be driven largely by expectations of more expansionary fiscal policy in the aftermath of U.S. elections.  Nominal Treasury yields rose across the ma-turity spectrum, and measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities contin-ued to move up.  Meanwhile, broad equity price indexes increased, and credit spreads on corporate bonds nar-rowed.  Most private borrowing rates increased some-what, but financing conditions for nonfinancial firms and households remained broadly accommodative. Market expectations for an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the December meeting rose over the intermeeting period.  By the end of the period, quotes on federal funds futures contracts, without ad-justment for term premiums, suggested that market par-ticipants saw a nearly 95 percent probability of a rate hike.  In addition, the expected federal funds rate path over the next few years implied by quotes on overnight index swap (OIS) rates steepened.  Most of the steepen-ing of the expected policy path occurred following the U.S. elections, reportedly in part reflecting investors' perception that the incoming Congress and Administra-tion would enact significant fiscal stimulus measures.  Market-based measures of uncertainty regarding mone-tary policy at horizons beyond one year moved up, sug-gesting that some of the firming in OIS rates could re-flect a rise in term premiums.  Consistent with market-based estimates, respondents to the Desk's December surveys of primary dealers and market participants as-signed a probability near 90 percent to a rate hike in De-cember. Nominal Treasury yields moved up considerably since the November FOMC meeting.  Intermediate- and longer-term yields were boosted by roughly equal in-creases in real yields and inflation compensation.  Measures of inflation compensation extended an up-ward trajectory that began around midyear.  Changes in market quotes for inflation caps and floors suggested that the rise in inflation compensation reflected in part    higher costs of protection against above-target inflation outcomes.  The rise in inflation compensation appeared to be spurred in part by the recent climb in oil prices, with a notable jump after OPEC's agreement at its No-vember 30 meeting to cut production. Broad U.S. equity price indexes rose over the intermeet-ing period, apparently boosted by investors' expecta-tions of stronger earnings growth and improved risk sen-timent, with much of the rally coming after the U.S. elec-tions.  Share prices for the financial sector outperformed the broader market, while stock prices in sectors that typically benefit from lower interest rates, such as utili-ties, underperformed.  Implied volatility in equity mar-kets decreased, and yield spreads of nonfinancial corpo-rate bonds over those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed for both investment- and  speculative-grade firms.  Available reports suggested that earnings for firms in the S&P 500 index increased in the third quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, and the im-provement in earnings was broad based across sectors. Money market flows continued to stabilize over the in-termeeting period following outsized movements in the period before implementation of MMF reforms in mid-October.  Assets under management at government MMFs rose modestly, while assets at prime MMFs were about unchanged.  In addition, outstanding levels of commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of de-posit were stable.  The effective federal funds rate re-mained well within the FOMC's target range.  Rates on overnight Eurodollar deposits, CP, and other short-term unsecured instruments were close to the federal funds rate.  Overnight Treasury repo rates declined in mid- November but stayed above the ON RRP offering rate.  Rates on term money market instruments increased, consistent with firming expectations for a December rate hike. Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained generally accommodative.  Although gross issuance of corporate bonds slowed notably in October and No-vember from the brisk pace in the third quarter, the de-crease in corporate bond spreads after the U.S. elections suggests that the lower issuance did not reflect a tighten-ing of financial conditions.  In addition, growth in com-mercial and industrial loans from banks picked up after having dipped some during the third quarter, issuance of leveraged loans by nonbanks was robust, and CP out-standing at nonfinancial firms increased on balance. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained solid.  The volume of corporate bond rating downgrades in October and November outpaced that of upgrades but was moderate compared with rates seen in the first half of the year.  Default rates and expected year-ahead default rates for nonfinancial firms declined modestly over the intermeeting period, although both remained somewhat elevated compared with their ranges in recent years.  Indicators of supply and demand conditions for small business credit were generally unchanged over the past quarter, with demand appearing to remain weak. Gross issuance of municipal bonds remained solid in October, and the credit quality of state and local govern-ments was stable, as the number of ratings downgrades only moderately outpaced the number of upgrades in October and November.  Yields on general obligation bonds rose somewhat more than those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities over the intermeeting pe-riod, reportedly reflecting expected reductions in the tax benefit of municipal bonds. Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) also remained largely accommodative.  The average rate of growth of CRE loans at banks continued to be strong in October and November.  Spreads on commercial mortgage-backed securities narrowed a little over the in-termeeting period, and issuance of such securities con-tinued to outpace that of the first half of 2016. The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate residential mort-gages moved up in line with Treasury yields, although the rate remained low by historical standards and mort-gage availability appeared little changed.  Likely in part because of the increase in mortgage rates, refinance orig-inations decreased in November, but purchase origina-tions were little changed. Consumer credit continued to be readily available for most borrowers, and overall loan balances increased about 6 percent over the 12 months ending in Septem-ber.  In the subprime sector, credit card lending stand-ards appeared to remain tight, and extensions of new credit to subprime auto loan borrowers edged down in the third quarter.  Measures of consumer credit quality were little changed in the third quarter. Foreign financial markets responded primarily to U.S. developments over the intermeeting period, as market participants assessed the effects of potential policy changes resulting from the U.S. elections on foreign economies.  Spillovers from U.S. markets lifted yields and equity prices in most AFEs, but higher yields in the United States seemed to weigh on investor sentiment to-ward EMEs, where prices of risky assets declined.  On a trade-weighted basis, the dollar appreciated notably against both AFE and EME currencies.  In particular,    the dollar strengthened about 10 percent against the Jap-anese yen and 5 percent against the Mexican peso.  The declines in EME currencies and risky asset prices were reportedly driven by higher U.S. yields as well as by un-certainty about possible changes in U.S. trade policies.  Currency weakness prompted some EME central banks, such as the Bank of Mexico and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, to tighten monetary policy.  How-ever, the Central Bank of Brazil eased monetary policy to support economic growth. In the euro area, investors were attentive to the consti-tutional referendum in Italy and the December meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).  In Italy, the  No  vote on constitutional reform and the subsequent resig-nation of the prime minister raised concerns that recap-italization of the country's banking sector would become more difficult.  However, these developments left little imprint on financial markets on net.  At its December meeting, the ECB extended its asset purchase program for a longer period of time than market participants an-ticipated while reducing the pace of asset purchases.  In addition, the minimum maturity for eligible securities was lowered, and the limitation on purchases of securi-ties with a yield below the deposit facility rate was re-laxed.  As a result, sovereign yield curves in the euro area steepened somewhat. Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting, the near-term fore-cast was little changed from the projection prepared for the November meeting.  Real GDP growth in the sec-ond half of 2016 was still expected to be faster than in the first half.  The staff's forecast for real GDP growth over the next several years was slightly higher, on bal-ance, largely reflecting the effects of the staff's provi-sional assumption that fiscal policy would be more ex-pansionary in the coming years.  These effects were sub-stantially counterbalanced by the restraint from the higher assumed paths for longer-term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  The staff pro-jected that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 2017 through 2019.  The unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually, on net, and to continue to run below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate through the end of 2019; the path for the unemployment rate was a little lower than in the previous projection.                                                  6 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate. The near-term forecast for consumer price inflation was somewhat higher than in the previous projection, re-flecting recent increases in energy prices.  Beyond the near term, the inflation forecast was little revised.  The staff continued to project that inflation would edge up over the next several years, as food and energy prices along with the prices of non-energy imports were ex-pected to begin steadily rising in 2017.  However, infla-tion was projected to be marginally below the Commit-tee's longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2019. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that mon-etary policy appeared to be better positioned to offset large positive shocks than substantial adverse ones.  In addition, the staff continued to see the risks to the fore-cast from developments abroad as skewed to the down-side.  Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside.  The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly bal-anced.  The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the dollar could appreciate more than anticipated were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential. Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-comes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2016 through 2019 and over the longer run, based on their individual assess-ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.6  The longer-run projections represented each partici-pant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes.    In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace since midyear.  Job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined.  Household spend-ing had been rising moderately, but business fixed in-vestment remained soft.  Inflation had increased since earlier in the year but was still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy im-ports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensa-tion had moved up considerably but still were low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-tions were little changed, on balance, in recent months. Participants expected that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further.  Inflation was ex-pected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices dissipated and the labor mar-ket strengthened further.  Participants indicated that re-cently available economic data had been broadly in line with their expectations, and they judged that near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly bal-anced.  Moreover, participants generally made only mod-est changes to their forecasts for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  About half of the participants incorporated an assumption of more expan-sionary fiscal policy in their forecasts. In their discussion of their economic forecasts, partici-pants emphasized their considerable uncertainty about the timing, size, and composition of any future fiscal and other economic policy initiatives as well as about how those policies might affect aggregate demand and sup-ply.  Several participants pointed out that, depending on the mix of tax, spending, regulatory, and other possible policy changes, economic growth might turn out to be faster or slower than they currently anticipated.  How-ever, almost all also indicated that the upside risks to their forecasts for economic growth had increased as a result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming years.  Many participants underscored the need to continue to weigh other risks and uncertainties attending the economic outlook.  In that regard, several noted upside risks to U.S. economic activity from the potential for better-than-expected economic growth abroad or an acceleration of domestic business invest-ment.  Among the downside risks cited were the possi-bility of additional appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar, financial vulnerabilities in some for-eign economies, and the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound.  Several participants also commented on the uncertainty about the outlook for productivity growth or about the potential effects of tight labor markets on labor supply and inflation.  For some participants, the greater upside risks to economic growth, the upward movement in inflation compensa-tion over recent months, or the possibility of further in-creases in oil prices had increased the upside risks to their inflation forecasts.  However, several others pointed out that a further rise in the dollar might con-tinue to hold down inflation.  Participants generally agreed that they should continue to closely monitor in-flation indicators and global economic and financial de-velopments. Regarding the household sector, the available infor-mation indicated that consumer spending had been ris-ing at a moderate rate, on balance, since midyear.  Par-ticipants cited a number of factors likely to support con-tinued moderate gains in consumer spending.  Con-sumer confidence remained positive.  The outlook was for further solid gains in jobs and income, and house-hold balance sheets had improved.  The personal saving rate was still relatively high, and household wealth had been boosted by ongoing gains in housing and equity prices.  In the housing market, recent data on starts and permits for new residential construction suggested a firming in residential investment after two quarters of decline.  Several participants commented that housing activity appeared to be gaining momentum in their Dis-tricts, and it was noted that the rate of new construction still appeared to be low relative to levels that would be expected based on the longer-run rate of household for-mation. The outlook for the business sector improved over the intermeeting period.  Although nonresidential invest-ment was still weak and equipment spending had been flat in the third quarter, orders for nondefense capital goods and the number of drilling rigs in operation had both turned up recently.  A couple of participants re-ported plans for a pickup in capital spending by busi-nesses in their Districts, driven by stronger demand and increasing revenues.  Surveys and information gathered from contacts in several Districts indicated an improve-ment in manufacturing activity as well as expectations for further gains in factory production in the near term.  And the recent firming in oil prices, if sustained, was an-   ticipated to boost domestic energy production.  In con-trast, conditions in the agricultural sector remained de-pressed, and a couple of reports highlighted softer activ-ity in some service-sector industries.  More generally, participants reported that many of their District business contacts expressed greater optimism about the eco-nomic outlook, and several participants commented that the improved sentiment could spur stronger investment spending.  Some contacts thought that their businesses could benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax, and regulatory policies, while others were uncertain about the outlook for significant government policy changes or were concerned that their businesses might be adversely affected by some of the proposals under discussion. Labor market conditions continued to improve over the intermeeting period.  Monthly increases in nonfarm pay-roll employment averaged nearly 180,000 over the three months ending in November, in line with the average pace of job creation over the past year.  The unemploy-ment rate dropped markedly to 4.6 percent in Novem-ber; a few participants suggested that part of the decline might be reversed in coming months.  Most participants viewed the cumulative progress in the labor market as having brought labor market conditions to or close to those consistent with the Committee's maximum- employment objective.  Over the past year, broad measures of labor underutilization that include both the unemployed and workers marginally attached to the la-bor force had trended lower, the labor force participa-tion rate had been relatively steady despite downward pressure from demographic trends, and layoffs had fallen to low levels.  National surveys reported that job availability was high and that firms were increasingly finding their job openings hard to fill.  Some participants commented that some businesses in their Districts were experiencing shortages of skilled workers in some occu-pations or were needing to offer higher wages to fill po-sitions.  However, some others noted that aggregate measures of wages were still rising at a subdued pace, suggesting that upward pressure on wages had not be-come widespread. Participants expected the labor market to strengthen somewhat further over the medium run, with almost all anticipating that the unemployment rate over the next couple of years would run below their estimates of its longer-run normal level.  Some participants saw the pos-sibility that an extended period during which labor mar-kets remained relatively tight could continue to shrink remaining margins of underutilization, including the still-high level of prime-age workers outside the labor force and elevated levels of involuntary part-time em-ployment and long-duration unemployment.  A few added that continued gradual strengthening in labor markets would help return inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.  But some other participants were uncertain that a period of tight labor utilization would yield lasting labor market benefits or were concerned that it risked a buildup of inflationary pressures.  Most participants expected that if economic growth remained moderate, as they projected, the unemployment rate would be only modestly below their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment over the next few years, but several anticipated a more substantial un-dershoot.  A few participants noted the uncertainty sur-rounding real-time estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, and it was pointed out that geo-graphic variation in labor market conditions contributed to that uncertainty.  In discussing the possible implica-tions of a more significant undershooting of the longer-run normal rate, many participants emphasized that, as the economic outlook evolved, timely adjustments to monetary policy could be required to achieve and main-tain both the Committee's maximum-employment and inflation objectives. Participants generally viewed the information on infla-tion received over the intermeeting period as reinforcing their expectation that inflation would rise to the Com-mittee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.  The 12-month change in the headline PCE price index moved up further to 1.4 percent in October, as the rise in energy prices since the spring offset much of the de-cline earlier in the year.  Although the headline measure was still below 2 percent, it had increased more than 1 percentage point over the past year.  Core PCE price inflation had also moved up moderately over the past year, and, over the 12 months ending in October, it was 1.7 percent for a third consecutive month.  Median  5-to-10-year inflation expectations in the Michigan sur-vey were, on balance, stable in November and early De-cember, just above the low recorded in October.   Market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up considerably over the intermeeting period.  A few participants added that other readings from financial markets, such as implied probabilities of various infla-tion outcomes derived from inflation derivatives, pricing in the inflation swaps market, and the apparent upward shift of the estimated term premium in the 10-year Treasury yield, suggested that the risks to the inflation outlook had become more balanced around the Com-mittee's 2 percent inflation objective.  A couple of par-ticipants noted that the recent firming in oil prices might    have contributed to the changes in these market-based measures.  Several, however, pointed out that market-based measures of inflation compensation were still low or that downside risks to inflation remained, given the recent further appreciation of the dollar. Most participants attributed the substantial changes in financial market conditions over the intermeeting pe-riod-including the increase in longer-term interest rates, the strengthening of the dollar, the rise in equity prices, and the narrowing of credit spreads-to expecta-tions for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming years or to possible reductions in corporate tax rates.  Many participants expressed the need for caution in evaluating the implications of recent financial market de-velopments for the economic outlook, in light of the un-certainty about how federal spending, tax, and regulatory policies might unfold and how global economic and fi-nancial conditions will evolve. In their consideration of economic conditions and mon-etary policy, participants agreed that sufficient evidence had accumulated of continued progress toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation to warrant an increase of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  Participants judged that, even after the increase in the target range, the stance of policy would remain accommodative, consistent with some further strength-ening in labor market conditions and a return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium term. Participants discussed the implications of the economic outlook for the likely future path of the target range for the federal funds rate.  Most participants judged that a gradual pace of rate increases was likely to be appropri-ate to promote the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  A gradual pace was also viewed by some participants as likely to be war-ranted because the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound placed constraints on the abil-ity of monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks to the aggregate demand for goods and services.  In addi-tion, the neutral real rate-defined as the real interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating at or near its potential-still appeared to be low by historical standards, and it was noted that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over the next few years probably would be sufficient to return to a neutral policy stance. While viewing a gradual approach to policy firming as likely to be appropriate, participants emphasized the need to adjust the policy path as economic conditions evolved.  They pointed to a number of risks that, if real-ized, might call for a different path of policy than they currently expected.  Moreover, uncertainty regarding fis-cal and other economic policies had increased.  Partici-pants agreed that it was too early to know what changes in these policies would be implemented and how such changes might alter the economic outlook.  It was also noted that fiscal and other policies were only some of the many factors that could influence the economic out-look and thus the appropriate course of monetary policy.  Moreover, many participants emphasized that the greater uncertainty about these policies made it more challenging to communicate to the public about the likely path of the federal funds rate.  Participants noted that, in the circumstances of heightened uncertainty, it was especially important that the Committee continue to underscore in its communications that monetary policy would continue to be set to promote attainment of the Committee's statutory objectives of maximum employ-ment and price stability. Many participants judged that the risk of a sizable under-shooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate had increased somewhat and that the Committee might need to raise the federal funds rate more quickly than currently anticipated to limit the degree of undershoot-ing and stem a potential buildup of inflationary pres-sures.  However, with inflation still below the Commit-tee's 2 percent objective, it was noted that downside risks to inflation remained and that a moderate under-shooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate could help return inflation to 2 percent.  A couple of participants expressed concern that the Committee's communications about a gradual pace of policy firming might be misunderstood as a commitment to only one or two rate hikes per year; participants agreed that policy would need to respond appropriately to the evolving outlook.  Several participants noted circumstances that might warrant changes to the path for the federal funds rate could also have implications for the reinvestment of proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and princi-pal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed se-curities. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in November indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace since midyear.  Job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined.  Household spending had been rising moderately, but    business fixed investment had remained soft.  Inflation had increased since earlier this year but was still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of infla-tion compensation had moved up considerably but still were low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance. With respect to the economic outlook and its implica-tions for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further.  They generally observed that labor market conditions had improved appreciably over the past year and that labor market slack had declined.  Members agreed that there was heightened uncertainty about possible changes in fiscal and other economic pol-icies as well as their effects.  However, members also agreed that near-term risks to the economic outlook ap-peared roughly balanced.  Some members saw, with gradual adjustments of the stance of monetary policy, only modest risk of a scenario in which an undershoot-ing of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment would create a sharp acceleration in prices.  These mem-bers observed that inflation continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent objective and that wage gains had been subdued, and they expressed the view that inflation was likely to rise gradually, giving monetary policy time to respond if necessary.  Several members noted that if the labor market appeared to be tightening significantly more than expected, it might become necessary to adjust the Committee's communications about the expected path of the federal funds rate, consistent with the possi-bility that a less gradual pace of increases could become appropriate. At this meeting, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, in-flation would rise to the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further.  This view was reinforced by the rise in inflation in recent months and by recent increases in inflation compensa-tion.  Against this backdrop and in light of the current shortfall in inflation from 2 percent, members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor actual and expected progress toward the Committee's inflation goal. After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the la-bor market, and inflation, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ½ to ¾ percent.  This increase in the target range was viewed as appropri-ate in light of the considerable progress that had been made toward the Committee's objective of maximum employment and, in view of the rise in inflation since earlier in the year, the Committee's confidence that in-flation would rise to 2 percent in the medium term.  Members judged that, even after this increase in the tar-get range, the stance of monetary policy remained ac-commodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. The Committee agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maxi-mum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assess-ment would take into account a wide range of infor-mation, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta-tions, and readings on financial and international devel-opments.  The Committee expected that economic con-ditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, members emphasized that the ac-tual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee also decided to maintain its existing pol-icy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it antici-pated doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  Members noted that this policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help main-tain accommodative financial conditions. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.:  Effective December 15, 2016, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary    to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of ½ to ¾ percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse re-purchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conven-tions) at an offering rate of 0.50 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such op-erations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc-tion and to continue reinvesting principal pay-ments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-curities.  The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap trans-actions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:  Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year.  Job gains have been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined.  House-hold spending has been rising moderately but business fixed investment has remained soft. In-flation has increased since earlier this year but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy im-ports. Market-based measures of inflation com-pensation have moved up considerably but still are low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of mon-etary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.  Inflation is ex-pected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and fi-nancial developments. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee de-cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ½ to ¾ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 per-cent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future ad-justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-count a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international de-velopments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee ex-pects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as in-formed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its hold-ings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed se-curities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.  Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. Dudley, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Stanley Fischer,    Esther L. George, Loretta J. Mester, Jerome H. Powell, Eric Rosengren, and Daniel K. Tarullo. Voting against this action:  None. To support the Committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances ¼ percentage point, to ¾ percent, effective December 15, 2016.  The Board of Governors also voted unanimously to approve a ¼ per-centage point increase in the primary credit rate (dis-count rate) to 1¼ percent, effective December 15, 2016.7 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on TuesdayŒWednesday, January 31ŒFebruary 1, 2017.  The meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. on December 14, 2016. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on November 22, 2016, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on November 1Œ2, 2016.    _____________________________ Brian F. Madigan Secretary                                                   7 In taking this action, the Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, At-lanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Fran-cisco.  This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 1¼ percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Bank, effective on the later of December 15, 2016, and the date such Reserve Bank informed the Secretary of the Board of such a request.  (Secretary's note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis was informed by the Secretary of the Board of the Board's approval of its establishment of a primary credit rate of 1¼ percent, effective December 15, 2016.)  This vote of the Board of Governors also encompassed approval of the renewal by all 12 Federal Reserve Banks of the existing for-mulas for calculating the rates applicable to discounts and ad-vances under the secondary and seasonal credit programs.      Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-tee (FOMC) meeting held on December 13Œ14, 2016, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unem-ployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2016 to 2019 and over the longer run.1  Each participant's pro-jection was based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of ap-propriate monetary policy, including a path for the fed-eral funds rate and its longer-run value, and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.   Appropriate monetary policy  is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpreta-tion of the Federal Reserve's objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. Most FOMC participants expected that, under appropri-ate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic prod-uct (GDP) would pick up a bit next year and run at or slightly above their individual estimates of its longer-run rate through 2019.  Almost all participants projected that the unemployment rate would run below their estimates of its longer-run normal level in 2017 and remain below that level through 2019.  All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption ex-penditures (PCE), would increase over the next two years, and several expected inflation to slightly exceed the Committee's 2 percent objective in 2018 or 2019.  Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. As shown in figure 2, almost all participants expected that the evolution of economic conditions would war-rant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and sustain maximum employment and 2 per-cent inflation.  Many participants judged that the appro-priate level of the federal funds rate in 2019 would be close to their estimates of its longer-run normal level.  However, the economic outlook is uncertain, and partic-                                                 1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate. ipants noted that their economic projections and assess-ments of appropriate monetary policy may change in re-sponse to incoming information.  A majority of participants viewed the level of uncertainty associated with their individual forecasts for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly similar to the norms of the previous 20 years, though some par-ticipants saw uncertainty associated with their forecasts as higher than average.  Most participants also judged the risks around their projections for economic activity, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly balanced, while several participants saw the risks to their forecasts of real GDP growth as weighted to the upside and the risks to their unemployment rate forecasts as tilted to the downside.   The Outlook for Economic Activity The median of participants' projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual as-sumptions about appropriate monetary policy, was 1.9 percent in 2016, 2.1 percent in 2017, 2.0 percent in 2018, and 1.9 percent in 2019; the median of projections for the longer-run normal rate of real GDP growth was 1.8 percent.  Most participants projected that economic growth would pick up a bit in 2017 from the current year's pace and run at or slightly above their individual estimates of its longer-run rate through 2019.  Compared with the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the medians of the projections for real GDP growth were slightly higher over the period from 2017 to 2019, while the median assessment of the longer-run growth rate was unchanged.  Since September, almost half of the participants revised up their projections for real GDP growth in 2018 or 2019, generally only slightly.  Those increasing their projections for output growth in those years cited expected changes in fiscal, regulatory, or other policies as factors contributing to their revi-sions.  However, many participants noted that the effects on the economy of such policy changes, if implemented, would likely be partially offset by tighter financial condi-tions, including higher longer-term interest rates and a strengthening of the dollar. The median of projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 4.7 percent, slightly lower than in September.

Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-pants' projections for real GDP growth and the unem-ployment rate from 2016 to 2019 and in the longer run.  The distributions of individual projections of real GDP growth shifted slightly higher relative to the distribution of the September projections for 2017 through 2019.  The distributions of projections for the unemployment rate shifted modestly lower for 2016 through 2019, while the distribution of projections for the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was unchanged. The Outlook for Inflation In the December SEP, the median of projections for headline PCE price inflation in 2016 was 1.5 percent, a bit higher than in September.  The median of projections for headline PCE price inflation was 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2.0 percent in 2018 and 2019, unchanged from Sep-tember.  Several participants projected that inflation will slightly exceed the Committee's objective in 2018 or 2019.  The medians of projections for core PCE price inflation were the same as in September, rising from 1.7 percent in 2016 to 1.8 percent in 2017 and 2.0 per-cent in 2018 and 2019. Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-bution of participants' views about the outlook for infla-tion.  The distributions of projections for headline and core PCE price inflation shifted up slightly relative to projections for the September meeting.  Some partici-pants attributed the upward shift in projected inflation this year and next to recent data that showed somewhat higher inflation than they had expected.  A few saw higher inflation in 2019 in conjunction with somewhat greater undershooting of the unemployment rate below its longer-run normal level. Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants' judgments regarding the appropriate target for the fed-eral funds rate at the end of each year from 2016 to 2019 and over the longer run.2  All participants saw an in-crease of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate at the                                                  2 One participant's projections for the federal funds rate, real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation were in-formed by the view that there are multiple possible medium-term regimes for the U.S. economy, that these regimes are per-sistent, and that the economy shifts between regimes in a way December meeting as appropriate.  The distributions for 2017 through 2019 shifted up modestly.  The median projections of the federal funds rate continued to show gradual increases, to 1.4 percent at the end of 2017, 2.1 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.9 percent at the end of 2019; the median of the longer-run projections of the federal funds rate was 3.0 percent.  The medians of the projections for the level of the federal funds rate for 2017 through 2019 were all 25 basis points higher than in the September projections.  A few participants revised up their assessments of the longer-run federal funds rate 25 basis points, resulting in an increase in the median of 13 basis points.   In discussing their December forecasts, many partici-pants expressed a view that increases in the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely be gradual in light of a short-term neutral real interest rate that cur-rently was low-a phenomenon that a number of partic-ipants attributed to the persistence of low productivity growth, continued strength of the dollar, a weak outlook for economic growth abroad, strong demand for safe longer-term assets, or other factors-and that was likely to rise only slowly as the effects of these factors faded over time.  Some participants noted the continued prox-imity of short-term nominal interest rates to the effective lower bound, even with an increase at this meeting, as limiting the Committee's ability to increase monetary ac-commodation to counter possible adverse shocks to the economy.  These participants judged that, as a result, the Committee should take a cautious approach to removing policy accommodation.  Many participants noted that there was currently substantial uncertainty about the size, composition, and timing of prospective fiscal policy changes, but they also commented that a more expan-sionary fiscal policy might raise aggregate demand above sustainable levels, potentially necessitating somewhat tighter monetary policy than currently anticipated.  Fur-thermore, several participants indicated that recent infla-tion data and the continued strengthening in labor mar-ket conditions increased their confidence that inflation would move toward the 2 percent objective, making a slightly firmer path of monetary policy appropriate.    that cannot be forecast.  Under this view, the economy cur-rently is in a regime characterized by expansion of economic activity with low productivity growth and a low short-term real interest rate, but longer-term outcomes for variables other than inflation cannot be usefully projected.

Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts.  Projection is percent change, fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Uncertainty and Risks The left-hand column of figure 4 shows that, for each variable, a majority of participants judged the levels of uncertainty associated with their December projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core inflation to be broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years.3  However, more partici-pants than in September saw uncertainty surrounding real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or inflation as higher than average.  Many participants mentioned an                                                  3 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total con-sumer price inflation over the period from 1996 through 2015.  At the end of this summary, the box  Forecast Uncertainty  increase in uncertainty associated with fiscal, trade, im-migration, or regulatory policies as a factor influencing their judgments about the degree of uncertainty sur-rounding their projections.  Participants cited the diffi-culty of predicting the size, composition, and timing of these policy changes as well as the magnitude and timing of their effects on the economy. As can be seen in the right-hand column of figure 4, a majority of participants continued to see the risks to real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline infla-tion, and core inflation as broadly balanced; however, fewer participants saw risks to economic growth and in-flation as weighted to the downside or saw risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside than in September.  A number of participants noted that the prospect of expansionary fiscal policy had increased the upside risks to economic activity and inflation, and a few assessed the possibility of a reduction in regulation as posing upside risks to their forecasts of economic activ-ity.  Moreover, some participants judged that the recent rise in market-based measures of inflation compensation suggested that downside risks to inflation had declined.  However, many also pointed to various sources of downside risk to economic activity, such as the limited potential for monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks when the federal funds rate is near the effective lower bound, downside risks in Europe and China, a possible increase in trade barriers, and the possibility of a sharp rise in financial market volatility in the event that fiscal and other policy changes diverged from market ex-pectations.  In addition, some participants pointed to factors such as global disinflationary trends and down-ward pressure on import prices from further strengthen-ing of the dollar as sources of downside risk to inflation.  discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the participants' projec-tions.

Forecast Uncertainty    The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policy-makers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.  Considerable uncer-tainty attends these projections, however.  The economic and statistical models and relation-ships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen develop-ments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely eco-nomic outcome as embodied in their projec-tions, but also the range of alternative possibil-ities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they oc-cur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board's staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.  The projec-tion error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-tending those projections is similar to that ex-perienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would ex-pand within a range of  2.1 to 3.9 percent in the current year, 1.3 to 4.7 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third and fourth years.  The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third and fourth years. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast un-certainty in the past, as shown in table 2.  Partic-ipants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the up-side, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, participants judge whether each variable is more likely to be above or below their projections of the most likely out-come.  These judgments about the uncertainty and the risks attending each participant's projec-tions are distinct from the diversity of partici-pants' views about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks associated with a particular projection rather than with divergences across a number of differ-ent projections. As with real activity and inflation, the out-look for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This un-certainty arises primarily because each partici-pant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward.
