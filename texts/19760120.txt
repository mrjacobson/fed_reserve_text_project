By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period December 16, 1975, through January 19, 1976, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that output of goods and services--which had increased very sharply in the third quarter of 1975--expanded more moderately in the fourth quarter. In December retail sales rose sharply, but the increase in the fourth quarter as a whole was less than that in the third quarter. After having slowed over the preceding 2 months, the rise in industrial production and in nonfarm payroll employment accelerated in December.  However, the unemployment rate remained at 8.3 per cent, as the civilian labor force grew about as much as total employment. The increase in average wholesale prices of industrial commodities was again relatively large, but average prices of farm products and foods declined sharply further. The index of average wage rates was unchanged in December, following 2 months of large increases.  The exchange value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies held steady in December but eased somewhat in early January. Another sizable foreign trade surplus was registered in November.  M1 declined in December, and growth in M2 and M3 slowed considerably. At commercial banks, inflows of time and savings deposits other than large-denomination CD's slowed, despite a continuing build-up of business 1/20/76savings accounts, while inflows of deposits to nonbank thrift institutions were relatively well maintained.  In terms of quarterly averages, growth in M1 from the third to the fourth quarter was modest, while growth in M2 and M3 was more substantial. In recent weeks interest rates on both short- and long-term securities have declined appreciably. In mid-January Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced from 6 to 5-1/2 per cent.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to maintain prevailing bank reserve and money market conditions over the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates currently expected.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Wednesday, February 18, 1976, at 9:00 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
