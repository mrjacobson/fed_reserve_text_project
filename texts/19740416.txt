Secretary's Note: The following action was taken on Tuesday, April 16, 1974.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services declined appreciably in the first quarter and that price increases were exceptionally large. The decline in economic activity reflected mainly the impact of the oil shortage, which is being eased by the ending of the oil embargo. In March industrial production and manufacturing employment receded further, but retail sales strengthened. The unemployment rate changed little, remaining slightly above 5 per cent.  Prices of farm and food products declined in March, but increases among industrial commodities were widespread and extraordinarily large. Advances in wage rates were moderate in the first quarter.  In March the dollar depreciated further against leading foreign currencies, and the balance of payments was in deficit on the official settlements basis. The U.S. trade surplus diminished again in February as the cost of imported oil rose sharply. 4/15-16/74 -5The narrowly defined money stock increased sharply again in March. Broader measures of the money stock rose more moderately, however, as net inflows of consumer-type time deposits at banks slowed substantially. Business short-term credit demands remained strong, with demands at banks exceptionally large. To help finance loan growth, banks in late March and early April stepped up the issuance of large-denomination CD's and also increased borrowings from abroad. Both short- and long-term market interest rates have risen considerably further in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, supporting a resumption of real economic growth, and maintaining equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing and of international and domestic financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that would moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 21, 1974, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
