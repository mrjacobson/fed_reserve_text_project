By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that, while the direct and indirect effects of strikes have been retarding activity in some areas of the economy, prospects still favor more rapid economic growth in the months ahead. Although prices of farm products and foods have declined recently, upward pressures persist on industrial prices and costs.  While there recently have been further inflows of liquid funds from abroad through foreign branches of U.S. banks, the balance of payments continues to reflect a substantial underlying deficit. Bank credit expansion has continued large. The volume of new private security issues has expanded further and interest rates remain under upward pressure,reflecting in part increased doubts in financial markets concerning enactment of the President's fiscal program. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial 11/14/67conditions, including bank credit growth, conducive to sustainable economic expansion, recognizing the need for reasonable price stability for both domestic and balance of payments purposes.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the prevailing conditions in the money market; but operations shall be modified as necessary to moderate any apparent tendency for bank credit to expand significantly more than currently expected.
