By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests continued substantial growth in real output of goods and services in the current quarter, although at a rate less rapid than in the fourth quarter of 1972. The unemployment rate has declined slightly further. In recent months wage rates have increased at a relatively rapid pace, and unit labor costs turned up in the fourth quarter of 1972. The rise in consumer prices slowed in December when retail prices of foods changed little, but prices of foods and foodstuffs at earlier stages of distribution rose sharply in both December and January.  The excess of U.S. merchandise imports over exports remained large in December. Heavy speculative movements out of dollars into German marks and some other currencies developed in late January and early February. On February 12 the Government announced that the United States would devalue the dollar by 10 per cent.  The narrowly defined money stock changed little in January after having increased sharply in December, and growth over the 2 months combined was at an average annual rate of about 6-1/2 per cent. Growth in the more broadly defined money stock slowed less abruptly from December to January as inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to banks accelerated. A sharp and pervasive increase has taken place in bank loans to businesses. In recent weeks market interest rates generally have risen further, with increases substantial 2/13/73for short-term rates and relatively moderate for longterm rates. Most recently, however, Treasury bill rates have moved back down under the influence of foreign official buying.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions consonant with the aims of the economic stabilization program, including further abatement of inflationary pressures, sustainable growth in real output and employment, and progress toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of possible domestic credit market and international developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support somewhat slower growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than occurred on average in the past 6 months.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, March 20, 1973, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
