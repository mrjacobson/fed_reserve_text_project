By unanimous vote, the dollar limit specified in paragraph 2 of the continuing authority directive, on Federal Reserve Bank holdings of short-term certificates of indebtedness purchased directly from the Treasury, was decreased from $2 billion to $1 billion. As amended, paragraph 2 read as follows: The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or, if the New York Reserve Bank is closed, any other Federal Reserve Bank, to purchase directly from the Treasury for its own account (with discretion, in cases where it seems desirable, to issue participations to one or more Federal Reserve Banks) such amounts of special short-term certificates of indebtedness as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury; provided that the rate charged on such certificates shall be a rate 1/4 of 1 per cent below the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of such purchases, and provided further that the total amount of such certificates held at any one time by the Federal Reserve Banks shall not exceed $1 billion. 6/29/71By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is expanding moderately in the current quarter and that the unemployment rate has remained high. Wage rates in most sectors are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. The rate of advance in both consumer prices and wholesale prices of industrial commodities has stepped up again recently after moderating earlier in the year. In June, according to tentative estimates, the money stock both narrowly and broadly defined is still growing rapidly on average, although less than in May; growth in the bank credit proxy remains below the first-quarter rate. Interest rates on most types of market securities have increased on balance in recent weeks. The market exchange rate for the German mark has advanced, and a substantial flow of funds from Germany to other markets has occurred in recent weeks.  In consequence of a partial reversal of the earlier speculative outflows of short-term capital from the United States and of an increase in Euro-dollar borrowings of U.S. banks, there has been a surplus in the U.S. payments balance on the official settlements basis in this period. The U.S. merchandise trade balance, which had been in small surplus in the first quarter, was in deficit in April and May. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the resumption of sustainable economic growth, while encouraging an orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, moderation of short-term capital outflows, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to achieve more moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead, taking account of developments in capital markets. System open market operations 6/29/71until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to achieving bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with those objectives.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, July 27, 1971, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
