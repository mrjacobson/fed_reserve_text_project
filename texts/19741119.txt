By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is falling significantly further in the current quarter while price and wage increases are continuing large. In October industrial production declined--after having changed little since May--and the unemployment rate increased further, from 5.8 to 6.0 per cent.11/19/74 11/19/74In recent weeks sizable cutbacks in automobile production have been announced, and claims for unemployment insurance have continued to increase. There are major uncertainties concerning the duration of the coal strike; a lengthy shutdown would have substantial effects on other industries. The October rise in wholesale prices of industrial commodities, although substantial, remained well below the extraordinarily rapid rate in the first 8 months of the year; prices of farm products and foods increased sharply.  In recent weeks the dollar has declined further against leading foreign currencies. In the third quarter the U.S.  foreign trade deficit was substantially larger than in the second quarter, but U.S. banks sharply reduced their foreign lending.  Growth of the narrowly defined money stock picked up from the slow pace of the third quarter to an annual rate of about 5 per cent in October. Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks and at nonbank thrift institutions also improved in October, and the money supply measures more broadly defined expanded appreciably. Bank credit outstanding changed little, and banks reduced their borrowing through Euro-dollars and large-denomination CD's.  Since mid-October markets for short- and long-term securities have improved, despite heavy Treasury financing and a large volume of corporate security issues. Interest rates on market securities in general have declined further, and mortgage yields also have fallen somewhat. On November 13 the Board of Governors announced a restructuring of member bank reserve requirements, which will have the effect of releasing reserves to the banking system in the week beginning December 12.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, supporting a resumption of real economic growth, and achieving equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead. 11/19/74 -6It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on December 16 and 17, 1974.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
