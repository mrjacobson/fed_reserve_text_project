By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that, although consumer demands have been strong this summer, reduced rates of inventory accumulation and tapering growth of Government expenditures are being reflected in a slowing of expansion in over-all activity.  Industrial prices have been increasing less rapidly in recent months, but consumer prices have continued to rise substantially and wage pressures remain strong.  Most market interest rates have changed little on balance following reductions in Federal Reserve Bank discount rates. Growth in bank credit and time and savings deposits has been rapid this summer; growth in the money supply slowed in August as U.S. Government deposits were built up following an extended decline.  The earlier improvement in the U.S. balance of payments was not maintained in August, according to preliminary indications, and the foreign trade balance and underlying payments position continue to be matters of serious concern. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable economic growth, continued resistance to inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the prevailing conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that 9/10/68 -4operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.  It was agreed the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, October 8, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
