The dollar value of total retail sales, which had been unchanged in September, rose substantially in October. Industrial production and employment increased somewhat.  The unemployment rate, at 7.0 per cent, remained in the narrow range prevailing since April. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose sharply in October, as average prices of farm products and foods increased after having declined appreciably over the preceding 4 months.  Prices of industrial commodities rose at about the average rate of the preceding 12 months.  The index of average hourly earnings increased sharply in September and has advanced at a somewhat faster pace so far this year than it had on the average during 1976.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined further since mid-October. In September the U. S. foreign trade deficit was reduced somewhat, in part as a result of temporary factors.  M-1 and M-2 increased substantially in October, but growth slowed sharply in early November. In October inflows to banks of the total of savings deposits and small-denomination time deposits fell off, but banks expanded the outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's substantially as credit demands strengthened.-4 - 11/15/77Inflows to nonbank thrift institutions slowed somewhat in October from the strong pace of the preceding 2 months. Following a substantial rise in member bank borrowings, Federal Reserve discount rates were increased from 5-3/4 to 6 per cent in late October.  Market interest rates have fluctuated moderately since mid-October and most recently have tended to decline.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on October 18, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 8 to 10-1/2 per cent, respectively, from the third quarter of 1977 to the third quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing money market conditions during the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at about the current level, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the November-December period at annual rates within ranges of 1 to 7 per cent and 5 to 9 per cent, respectively. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth-5 - 11/15/77-6 -rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 per cent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, December 20, 1977, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
