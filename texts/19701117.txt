With Mr. Maisel dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by 11/17/70the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is changing little in the current quarter and that unemployment has increased. Part but not all of the weakness in overall activity is attributable to the strike in the automobile industry which apparently is now coming to an end. Wage rates generally are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, but gains in productivity appear to be slowing the increase in unit labor costs. Recent movements in major price measures have been erratic but the general pace of advance in these measures has tended to slow. Most interest rates declined considerably in the past few weeks, and Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced by one-quarter of a percentage point in the week of November 9. Demands for funds in capital markets have continued heavy, but business loan demands at banks have weakened. The money supply changed little on average in October for the second consecutive month; bank credit also was about unchanged, following a slowing of growth in September. The balance of payments deficit on the liquidity basis was at a lower rate in the third quarter and in October than the very high second-quarter rate, but the deficit on the official settlements basis remained high as banks repaid Eurodollar liabilities. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, while encouraging the resumption of sustainable economic growth and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets and moderate growth in money and attendant bank credit expansion over the months ahead, with allowance for temporary shifts in money and credit demands related to the auto strike. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall he conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with those objectives. 11/17/70 -5It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, December 15, 1970, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.
