With Mr. Hayes dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that over-all economic expansion has moderated somewhat from its very rapid pace earlier in the year, although less than projected, and that upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Market interest rates have risen in recent weeks. Bank credit and time and savings deposits have continued to expand rapidly, but savings inflows to thrift institutions have remained moderate.  The money supply, after growing little on balance during the summer, has increased in recent weeks. The U.S.  foreign trade balance and underlying payments position continue to be matters of serious concern. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable economic growth, continued resistance to inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the current Treasury financing, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the prevailing conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified, to the extent permitted by the Treasury financing, if bank credit expansion appears to be exceeding current projections. 10/29/68 -5It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, November 26, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.
