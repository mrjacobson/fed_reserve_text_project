With Mr. Maisel dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that expansion in real economic activity is continuing to moderate slightly, but that substantial upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Most market interest rates have risen considerably on balance in recent weeks, as credit demands continued strong against the background of considerable restraint on the banking system. Growth in bank credit and the money supply thus far in 1969 has been limited, and both declined somewhat on average in May. Largedenomination CD's have continued to run off at a rapid pace recently, and net inflows of consumer-type time 6/24/69and savings deposits have remained small. At nonbank thrift institutions, savings inflows slowed somewhat on average in April and May. Very heavy Euro-dollar borrowing by U.S. banks through their foreign branches produced a large surplus in the balance of payments on the official settlements basis after mid-May. On the other hand, high Euro-dollar interest rates apparently also stimulated outflows of funds from the United States that contributed to a large deficit on the liquidity basis thus far in June. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging a more sustainable rate of economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the firm conditions currently prevailing in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections or if unusual liquidity pressures should develop.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, July 15, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
