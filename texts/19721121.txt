By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, 11/20-21/72to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting, including recent data for industrial production, employment, and retail sales, suggests that real output of goods and services is growing more rapidly in the current quarter than in the third quarter. However, the unemployment rate has remained substantial. The increase in wages has been larger in recent months than earlier this year. Consumer prices rose considerably in September, but the October rise in wholesale prices was small. In recent weeks, the current account deficit of the U.S. balance of payments has been offset in large part by capital inflows; while the reserves of Japan have increased substantially further, those of other industrial countries have changed little.  In September the excess of U.S. merchandise imports over exports remained large.  In October rates of growth in the monetary aggregates changed relatively little from preceding months, with expansion in the narrowly defined money stock again quite moderate. Since mid-October interest rates generally have declined.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the effects of recent bank regulatory changes, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support more moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than recorded in the third quarter.  It was agreed that the authorization for the lending of Government securities from the System Open Market Account should beretained at this time. 11/20-21/72It was agreed that the Market Committee would be held 9:30 a.m.next meeting of the Federal Open on Tuesday, December 19, 1972, atThe meeting adjourned.Secretary
