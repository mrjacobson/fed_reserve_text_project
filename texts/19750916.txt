By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period August 19 through September 15, 1975, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that output of goods and services--which had turned up in the second quarter--is increasing appreciably further in the current quarter. In August industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a faster pace than in July, and the average workweek in manufacturing continued to lengthen. The unemployment rate remained at 8.4 per cent, as the civilian labor force increased about as much as total employment. Retail sales apparently declined slightly, following 4 months of large gains.  The index of wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose somewhat more in August than in July, chiefly because of increases in prices of energy products; prices of farm and food products declined slightly. The advance in average wage rates over recent months has been somewhat less rapid than in 1974 and early 1975.  In recent weeks the exchange value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has risen somewhat further. In July the U.S. foreign trade surplus declined from the very high second-quarter level, as imports rose 9/16/75sharply. Bank-reported capital movements showed a net inflow, in contrast to the net outflows of earlier months, while U.S. liabilities to foreign official agencies, which earlier had been rising, declined.  Expansion in M1 picked up somewhat in August from the low July rate. Growth in M2 and M3 slowed further, however, as inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to banks and to nonbank thrift institutions continued to moderate, reflecting in part the increased attractiveness of alternative investments. Interest rates on short-term securities and on longer-term Treasury and corporate securities have shown little net change in recent weeks, except that longer-term yields adjusted upward following the Treasury's September 10 announcement of its sizable borrowing requirements over the rest of this year. Yields on State and local government securities rose to new highs in early September, as a result of widespread concern about possible repercussions of New York City's financial crisis; on September 9 a State program to assist the City was enacted.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to stimulating economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on October 21, 1975, at 9:00 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
