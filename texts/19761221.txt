The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent necessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time to time: A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with other international financial institutions: Austrian schillings Belgian francs Canadian dollars Danish kroner Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Japanese Yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs-3 - 12/20-21/76B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above.  C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.  D. To maintain an over-all open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding $1.0 billion, unless a larger position is expressly authorized by the Committee.  For this purpose, the over-all open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of open positions in each currency. The open position in a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i. e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.  2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements ("swap" arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214. 5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity:-4 - 12/20-21/76 -5 Amount of arrangement (Millions of Foreign bank dollars equivalent) Austrian National Bank 250 National Bank of Belgium 1, 000 Bank of Canada 2, 000 National Bank of Denmark 250 Bank of England 3, 000 Bank of France 2, 000 German Federal Bank 2, 000 Bank of Italy 3, 000 Bank of Japan 2, 000 Bank of Mexico 360 Netherlands Bank 500 Bank of Norway 250 Bank of Sweden 300 Swiss National Bank 1, 400 Bank for International Settlements: Dollars against Swiss francs 600 Dollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs 1, 250 Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  3. Currencies to be used for liquidation of System swap commitments may be purchased from the foreign central bank drawn on, at the same exchange rate as that employed in the drawing to be liquidated. Apart from any such purchases at the rate of the drawing, all transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1(A) above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates. 12/20-21/76 -6 4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the Foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214. 5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested insofar as practicable, considering needs for minimum working balances.  Such investments shall be in accordance with Section 14(e) of the Federal Reserve Act.  6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported daily to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board Members designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, his alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the request of any member, or at the request of the Manager, for the purposes of reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other matters relating to his responsibilities. At the request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open Market Committee.  7.

From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.  8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.  9.

All operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.  1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available): A.

B. Any transaction which would result in gross transactions (excluding swap drawings and repayments) in a single foreign currency exceeding $100 million on any day or $300 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.  C. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 per cent of the size of the swap arrangement.  2.

The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System, and about any transactions that are not of a routine character.  Secretary's Note: The following actions were taken on Tuesday, December 21, 1976.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Commitee held on November 16, 1976, were approved.  By unanimous vote, the System Open Market transactions in foreign currencies during the period November 16 through December 20, 1976, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period November 16 through December 20, 1976, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:-10 - 12/20-21/76The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services in the fourth quarter has remained at about the reduced pace of the third quarter. In both October and November retail sales increased substantially. Industrial production rose appreciably in November--following 2 months of decline--in large part as a result of termination of strikes in two major industries, although advances in output were widespread among other industries. Employment in manufacturing also recovered from the effects of strikes. According to household survey data, the gain in total employment was large, but the unemployment rate increased from 7.9 to 8.1 per cent as the civilian labor force--which had changed little over the preceding 3 months--increased considerably. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose as much in November as in October, reflecting another substantial increase in average prices of industrial commodities; average prices of farm products and foods changed little.  The advance in the index of average wage rates over recent months has remained below the rapid rate of increase during 1975.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has declined slightly in recent weeks. The pound sterling and also the currencies associated in the European "snake" arrangement strengthened against the U. S. dollar, while the Canadian dollar depreciated sharply. In October the U. S. foreign trade deficit remained substantial.  M-1, which had expanded sharply in October, was unchanged in November. Although growth in M-2 and M-3 moderated, it remained substantial as inflows of the time and savings deposits included in these broader aggregates continued strong. Interest rates have declined appreciably in recent weeks. In late November Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced from 5-1/2 to 5-1/4 per cent, and in mid-December member bank reserve requirements were lowered somewhat.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.-11 - 12/20-21/76-12 -To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to maintain prevailing bank reserve and money market conditions over the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates currently expected.  By unanimous vote, transfer to the National Archives of the FOMC memoranda of discussion for 1971, on the basis described in a memorandum from the Secretariat dated December 8, 1976, was authorized.  The Committee took note of the present state of de facto suspension of paragraph 2 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations as a consequence of the expiration, on October 31, 1976, of the underlying statutory authority contained in a provision of Section 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on January 18, 1977, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
