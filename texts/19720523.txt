By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, 5/23/72to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting, including recent data for such measures of business activity as industrial production and employment, suggests that real output of goods and services may be growing at a faster rate in the current quarter than in the two preceding quarters, but the unemployment rate remains high. In April wholesale prices of farm and food products changed little--after having declined in March--but the rise in prices of industrial commodities remained substantial.  The consumer price index, which had been stable in March, increased somewhat. Wage rates continued to rise at a substantial pace. The U.S. balance of payments on the official settlements basis has been in small surplus since mid-March, but the payments balance on the net liquidity basis has apparently remained in deficit. In March merchandise imports continued to be considerably in excess of exports.  Growth in both the narrowly and broadly defined money stock slowed in April from the rapid rates in February and March, Inflows of savings funds to nonbank thrift institutions also slowed, but they remained at a relatively advanced pace. Reflecting a further increase in U.S. Government deposits and a rise in the outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's, the bank credit proxy continued to expand at a rapid rate. In recent weeks, market interest rates have fluctuated in a narrow range.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of capital market developments and possible Treasury refunding, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support somewhat slower growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead. 5/23/72 -5It was agreed that the next meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Monday and Tuesday, June 19-20, 1972.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
