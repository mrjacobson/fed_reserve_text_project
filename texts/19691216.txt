By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period November 25 through December 15, 1969, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that real economic activity has expanded only moderately in recent quarters and that a further slowing of growth appears to be in process. Prices and costs, however, are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. Most market interest rates have advanced further in recent weeks partly as a result of expectational factors, including concern about the outlook for fiscal policy. Bank credit rose rapidly in November after declining on average in October, while the money supply increased moderately over the two-month period; in the third quarter, bank credit had declined on balance and the money supply was about unchanged. The net contraction of outstanding large-denomination CD's has slowed markedly since late summer, apparently reflecting mainly an increase in foreign official time deposits. However, flows of consumer-type time and savings funds at banks and nonbank thrift institutions have remained weak, and there is considerable market concern about the potential size of net outflows expected around the year end. In November the balance of payments deficit on the liquidity basis diminished further and the official settlements balance reverted to surplus, mainly as a result of return 12/16/69flows out of the German mark and renewed borrowing by U.S. banks from their foreign branches. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging sustainable economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing firm conditions in the money market; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections or if unusual liquidity pressures should develop.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, January 13, 1970, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
