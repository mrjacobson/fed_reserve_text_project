With Mr. Hickman dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: 4/30/68The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that over-all economic activity has expanded at a very rapid pace thus far in 1968, with prices rising substantially, and that prospects are for a continuing rapid advance in activity and persisting inflationary pressures in the period ahead. Since late fall, growth rates of bank credit, the money supply, and time and savings accounts at financial institutions have on balance moderated considerably. Market interest rates have risen in recent weeks, partly in reaction to the firming of monetary policy including the further increase in Federal Reserve discount rates. The U.S. foreign trade balance has worsened further, and the international payments position of the United States continues to be a matter of serious concern. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resistance of inflationary pressures and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of Treasury financing activity, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the firmer conditions prevailing in the money market; provided, however, that operations shall be modified, to the extent permitted by Treasury financing, if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 28, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
