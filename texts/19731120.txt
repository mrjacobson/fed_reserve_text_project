In October total nonfarm employment expanded substantially further, and the unemployment rate dropped from 4.8 to 4.5 per cent. The advance in wage rates has remained relatively rapid, and unit labor costs have been increasing at a fast pace. Wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose sharply in October, reflecting in part large increases for petroleum products; although farm and food prices declined considerably further, they remained well above the pre-freeze level of early June. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar appreciated against major foreign currencies following announcement in late October of a large surplus in the U.S. merchandise trade balance, and the dollar strengthened markedly further in early November as expectations grew that the developing oil crisis would create particularly severe problems for Western Europe and Japan. In the third quarter and in October, the balance of payments on an official settlements basis was in substantial surplus.  The narrowly defined money stock, which had declined in August and September, rose moderately in October. The more broadly defined money stock expanded sharply as a result of large net inflows at banks of consumer-type time deposits. Net deposit inflows at nonbank thrift institutions improved somewhat further. Bank credit expansion remained moderate in October, reflecting in part a lack of growth in business loans as borrowers shifted to the commercial paper market. The outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's, which had begun to decline in late September, fell substantially further. Short-term market interest rates, while fluctuating widely, rose on balance from mid-October to midNovember. Rates on most types of long-term market securities also advanced somewhat.-5- 11/19-20/73 -6In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to abatement of inflationary pressures, a sustainable rate of advance in economic activity, and equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of international and domestic financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, December 18, 1973, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
