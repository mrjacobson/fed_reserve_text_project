The following actions took place on Tuesday, February 3, 1981.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period December 19, 1980, through February 2, 1981, were ratified.3/ Attended part of Monday session.-2 - 2/2-3/81By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period December 19, 1980, through February 2, 1981, were ratified.  With Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Committee adopted the following ranges for rates of growth in the monetary aggregates for the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis: M-1A, 3 to 5-1/2 percent; M-1B, 3-1/2 to 6 percent; M-2, 6 to 9 percent; and M-3, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  With Mrs. Teeters and Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP expanded substantially in the fourth quarter of 1980 and that prices on the average continued to rise rapidly. In December industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment expanded further, and the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged at about 7-1/2 percent. Retail sales declined, however, following a sizable gain over the preceding six months. Housing starts were about unchanged for the third month. Over the last few months of 1980, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was at about the rapid pace recorded earlier in the year.  The weighted average value of the dollar in exchange markets has risen further over the past six weeks. The U.S. trade deficit in the final quarter of 1980 widened from the exceptionally low rate in the third quarter but remained substantially less than the rate in the first half.  M-1A and M-1B declined sharply in December; in January, after adjustment of the actual figures for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, these aggregates recovered in part. Growth in M-2 slowed markedly in December but accelerated in January. Some-3 - 2/2-3/81moderation of the expansion in commercial bank credit in December and early January was accompanied by steppedup financing of nonfinancial businesses through issuance of commercial paper and longer-term debt instruments.  Market interest rates have declined on balance from their highs of mid-December.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2,and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 within ranges of 3 to 5-1/2 percent, 3-1/2 to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.  In the short-run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth in M-1A and M-1B from December to March at annual rates of 5 to 6 percent and in M-2 at a rate of about 8 percent, abstracting from the impact of flows into NOW accounts. These rates are associated with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the first quarter of 1981 at annual rates of about 2 percent, 2-3/4 percent, and 7 percent respectively. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M-1A and M-1B to an unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions. If it appears during the period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal funds rate, taken over a period of time, within a range of 15 to 20 percent are likely to be inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, March 31, 1981, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary-4-
