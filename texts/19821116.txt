In October the nominal value of retail sales edged up, but was little higher than in the second and third quarters; industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment continued to decline; and the unemployment rate rose another 0.3 percentage point to 10.4 percent. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained exceptionally high. In September and the third quarter as a whole, housing starts had strengthened. In recent months the advance in the index of average hourly earnings has remained considerably less rapid than during 1981.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies continued to appreciate from the end of September to mid-November. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in the third quarter was more than double the rate in the first two quarters of the year.  Growth of M1, already rapid in August and September, accelerated sharply in October in association with the maturing of a large volume of all savers certificates.  Growth of M2 and M3 picked up from.sluggish rates in September, but remained below the brisk pace of earlier in the year. Most short-term market interest rates have declined on balance since early October, after a reversal in September, and bond yields and mortgage rates have declined further. On October 8 the Federal Reserve announced a reduction in the discount rate from 10 percent to 9-1/2 percent. Quality spreads in the money markets, which had widened, have narrowed in recent weeks as interest rates have declined, and common stock prices have advanced sharply.-4- 11/16/82The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. In July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by reaffirming the monetary growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 that it had set at the February meeting. These ranges were 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary and credit aggregates around the top of the indicated ranges would be acceptable in the light of the relatively low base period for the M1 target and other factors, and that it would tolerate for some period of time growth somewhat above the target range should unusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity be evident in the light of current economic uncertainties. The Committee also indicated that it was tentatively planning to continue the current ranges for 1983 but that it would review that decision carefully in the light of developments over the remainder of 1982.  Specification of the behavior of M1 over the balance of the year remains subject to substantial uncertainty because of special circumstances in connection with the reinvestment of funds from maturing all savers certificates and the public's response to the new account directly competitive with money market funds mandated by recent legislation. The difficulties in interpretation of M1 continue to suggest that much less than usual weight be placed on movements in that aggregate during the current quarter.  In all the circumstances, the Committee seeks to maintain expansion in bank reserves needed for an orderly and sustained flow of money and credit, consistent with growth of M2 (and M3) of around 9-1/2 percent at an annual rate from September to December. Somewhat slower growth, bringing those aggregates around the upper part of the ranges set for the year, would be acceptable and desirable in a context of declining interest rates. Should economic and financial uncertainties lead to exceptional liquidity demands, somewhat more rapid growth in the broader aggregates would be tolerated. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.-5- 11/16/82 -6It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, December 21, 1982, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.
