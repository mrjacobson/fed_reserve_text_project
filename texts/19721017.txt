In September wages and prices advanced moderately, while the unemployment rate remained substantial. In the U.S. balance of payments, the current account deficit has been largely offset by capital inflows in recent weeks, and the central bank reserves of most industrial countries have continued to change little.  In August, the excess of U.S. merchandise imports over exports declined somewhat.  The narrowly and broadly defined money stock expanded at moderate rates in August and September, following large increases in July, but the bank credit proxy continued to grow rapidly. Since mid-September, short-term interest rates have increased somewhat, while yields on most longterm securities have changed little.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the effects of possible bank regulatory changes, Treasury financing operations, and developments in credit markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support more moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than recorded in the third quarter. 10/17/72 -5It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Monday and Tuesday, November 2021, 1972.  Thereupon the meeting adjourned.  Secretary
