To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U. S. Treasury, with the U. S.

D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding $12.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.  2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements ("swap" arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity:3/31/87-7 - Amount of arrangement (millions of dollars Foreign bank equivalent) Austrian National Bank 250 National Bank of Belgium 1,000 Bank of Canada 2,000 National Bank of Denmark 250 Bank of England 3,000 Bank of France 2,000 German Federal Bank 6,000 Bank of Italy 3,000 Bank of Japan 5,000 Bank of Mexico 700 Netherlands Bank 500 Bank of Norway 250 Bank of Sweden 300 Swiss National Bank 4,000 Bank for International Settlements: Dollars against Swiss francs 600 Dollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs 1,250 Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  3.

It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.3/31/87-8 - 5.

The Manager for Foreign Operations shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System, and about any operations that are not of a routine character.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 10-11, 1987, were approved.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 11 through March 30, 1987, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in government securities and agency obligations during the period February 11 through March 30, 1987, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests on balance that economic activity has been expanding at a faster pace than in the fourth quarter, with output apparently strengthened by a rebuilding of business inventories and some improvement in foreign trade. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose strongly again in February. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 6.7 percent for the third consecutive month. Industrial production also increased appreciably further in February. Total retail sales have continued to fluctuate substantially from month to month, largely reflecting the uneven pattern of automobile sales, but on balance overall consumer spending has been relatively flat over the past several months. Housing starts strengthened further in February after rising in December and January to their highest level since late spring. Business capital spending appears to have weakened in early 1987. Consumer and producer prices -13 -rose more rapidly in early 1987, primarily reflecting sizable increases in energy prices. Labor cost increases have remained relatively moderate in recent months.  Growth of M2 and M3 has slowed substantially from the pace in December and January, and for 1987 to date expansion of these two aggregates appears to have been around the lower ends of their respective ranges established by the Committee for the year. Growth of M1, after moderating in January from an exceptionally rapid pace in late 1986, also has slowed markedly further.  Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have moderated appreciably since year-end. Interest rates generally have fluctuated in a relatively narrow range since the February 10-11 meeting of the Committee, although they have firmed somewhat recently. At a meeting in the latter part of February, the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of major industrial countries agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around then-current levels. However, after mid-March, the trade-weighted value of the dollar against the other G-10 currencies declined further on balance, including a sizable decline against the yen.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at its February meeting established growth ranges of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for 1987.  With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must be judged in the light of other evidence relating to economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in interest rates, among other factors. During 1987, the Committee anticipates that growth in M1 should slow.  However, in the light of its sensitivity to a variety3/31/87 -14 -of influences, the Committee decided at the February meeting not to establish a precise target for its growth over the year as a whole. Instead, the appropriateness of changes in M1 during the course of the year will be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.  In that connection, the Committee believes that, particularly in the light of the extraordinary expansion of this aggregate in recent years, much slower monetary growth would be appropriate in the context of continuing economic expansion accompanied by signs of intensifying price pressures, perhaps related to significant weakness of the dollar in exchange markets, and relatively strong growth in the broad monetary aggregates. Conversely, continuing sizable increases in M1 could be accommodated in circumstances characterized by sluggish business activity, maintenance of progress toward underlying price stability, and progress toward international equilibrium.  As this implies, the Committee in reaching operational decisions during the year, might target appropriate growth in M1 from time to time in the light of circumstances then prevailing, including the rate of growth of the broader aggregates.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Somewhat greater reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on developments in foreign exchange markets, taking into account the behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the business expansion, progress against inflation, and conditions in credit markets. This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of around 6 percent or less. Growth in M1 is expected to remain substantially below its pace in 1986. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.3/31/87 3/31/87 -15 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 19, 1987.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary Secretary's note: On April 22, 1987, the Committee approved an increase of $3 billion, to $9 billion, in the intermeeting limit on changes in System holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities specified in paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations.  On May 6, the Committee approved a further increase of $2 billion, to $11 billion, in the limit. These actions were effective immediately, for the period ending May 19, 1987.
