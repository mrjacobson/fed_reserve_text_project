With Messrs. Maisel and Mitchell dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that expansion in real economic activity slowed somewhat in the first half of 1969 and some further moderation during the second half is projected. Substantial upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Long-term interest rates recently have risen to new peaks, while short-term rates have changed little on balance. In August the money supply decreased while U.S. Government deposits rose somewhat; bank credit declined further on average; the run-off of large-denomination CD's continued without abatement; and there were further net outflows from consumer-type time and savings accounts at banks.  The U.S. foreign trade surplus was very small in July.  The over-all balance of payments deficit on the liquidity basis remained very large in both July and August, while the balance on the official settlements basis shifted into deficit in August as U.S. banks' borrowings of Euro-dollars leveled off. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging sustainable economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments. 9/9/69 -5To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury refunding, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified, to the extent permitted by the Treasury refunding, if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections or if pressures arise in connection with foreign exchange developments or with bank regulatory changes.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, October 7, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
