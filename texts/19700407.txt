Fiscal stimulus, of dimensions that are still uncertain, will strengthen income expansion in the near term. Most long-term interest rates backed up during much of March under the pressure of heavy demands for funds, but then turned down in response to indications of some relaxation of monetary policy and to the reduction in the prime lending rate of banks. Short-term rates declined further on balance in recent weeks, contributing to the ability of banks and other thrift institutions to attract time and savings funds. Both bank credit and the money supply rose on average in March; over the first quarter as a whole bank credit was about unchanged on balance and the money supply increased somewhat. The U.S. foreign trade surplus increased in February, but the over-all balance of payments appears to have been in considerable deficit during the first quarter. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, while encouraging the resumption of sustainable economic growth and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee desires to see moderate growth in money and bank credit over the months ahead. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining money market conditions consistent with that objective, taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing. 4/7/70 -5It was agreed the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 5, 1970, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.
