By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that over-all economic activity has been expanding vigorously, with both industrial and consumer prices continuing to rise at a substantial rate, and that prospects are for further rapid growth and persisting inflationary pressures in the period ahead. The imbalance in U.S. international transactions worsened further in late 1967, but the new program announced by the President should result in a considerable reduction in the deficit this year. Following announcement of the program, foreign purchases of gold slackened abruptly and the dollar strengthened in foreign exchange markets. Long-term bond yields have declined in recent weeks but some short-term interest rates have risen further. Bank credit has changed little on balance recently as banks have disposed of Government securities to accommodate strengthened loan demands. Growth in the money supply has slackened and flows into time and savings accounts at bank and nonbank financial intermediaries have continued to moderate. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resistance of inflationary pressures and progress toward reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the somewhat firmer conditions that have developed in the money market in recent weeks, partly as a result of the increase in reserve requirements announced to become effective in mid-January; provided, however, that operations shall be modified as needed to moderate any apparently significant deviations of bank credit from current expectations. 1/9/68 -5It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, February 6, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.
