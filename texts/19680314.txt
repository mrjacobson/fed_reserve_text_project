On March 17 Chairman Martin made the same determination with respect to an increase in the swap line with the Bank of Sweden to $250 million equivalent.  Also, members of the Committee authorized the Special Manager to undertake negotiations looking toward increases in the reciprocal currency arrangements with (1) the German Federal Bank, from $750 to $1,000 million equivalent, on March 16, 1968; and (2) with the Bank of England, from $1,500 to $2,000 million equivalent, on March 17, 1968. It was understood that such increases and the corresponding amendments to paragraph 2 of the authorization for System foreign currency operations would become effective upon a determination by Chairman Martin that they were in the national interest.  Chairman Martin so determined on March 17, 1968. Messrs. Robertson and Maisel, in voting to approve the negotiation of a 3/14/68swap line increase with the German Federal Bank, noted that they continued to hold the general reservations concerning swap line increases at this juncture that they had expressed at the telephone conference meeting of the Committee held on March 14, but that since the majority of the Committee had approved such increases they felt it was appropriate that Germany also be included.  As a result of these actions, the table contained in paragraph 2 of the authorization for System foreign currency operations was amended, effective March 17, 1968, to read as follows: Amount of arrangement (millions of Foreign bank dollars equivalent) Austrian National Bank 100 National Bank of Belgium 225 Bank of Canada 1,000 National Bank of Denmark 100 Bank of England 2,000 Bank of France 100 German Federal Bank 1,000 Bank of Italy 750 Bank of Japan 1,000 Bank of Mexico 130 Netherlands Bank 400 Bank of Norway 100 Bank of Sweden 250 Swiss National Bank 600 Bank for International Settlements: System drawings in Swiss francs 600 System drawings in authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs 1,000 By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to 3/14/68execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: In light of recent international financial developments, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining firm but orderly conditions in the money market, taking into account the effects of increases in Federal Reserve discount rates.  By unanimous vote, procedures with respect to allocation of securities in the System Open Market Account were revised to read as follows: 1.

The Division of Bank Operations shall determine from these data the amount of adjustment needed in each Bank's gold reserves to equalize, to five places to the right of the decimal with the last digit rounded, the reserve ratios of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks at the close of business on the preceding day. The amount of adjustment, rounded to the nearest dollar, will be furnished to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  3. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall then reallocate the securities in the System Open Market Account as of the preceding day in such a way as to provide each Bank with a net settlement as close as possible to the amount of adjustment in paragraph 2.  4. The Board's staff and each Federal Reserve Bank shall then be notified of the amounts involved and the Interdistrict Settlement Fund may be closed after giving effect to the adjustments.  5.
