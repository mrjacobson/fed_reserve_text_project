By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 15, 1977, were approved.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 15 through March 14, 1977, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period February 15 through March 14, 1977, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services has increased in the current quarter from the reduced pace in the fourth quarter of 1976. In February industrial output and retail sales expanded substantially after being held down for a time by the effects of unusually severe weather. Employment rose considerably further; the unemployment rate-5 - 3/15/77increased somewhat to 7.5 per cent--as the labor force more than recovered the decline of January--but it remained below the 7.8 per cent of December. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose substantially in February, reflecting large increases for farm products and foods and for fuels and power. The index of average wage rates rose more moderately over the first 2 months of 1977 than it had on the average during 1976.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has changed little over the past month. In January the U. S.  foreign trade deficit increased further; exports were down a little from the fourthquarter rate and imports were substantially higher.  Growth in M-1 slowed sharply in February from the moderate pace in January. At banks and thrift institutions, inflows of time and savings deposits other than largedenomination CD's continued to slacken.  Business demands for short-term credit appear to have strengthened further in early 1977.  Since mid-Februay short-term market interest rates have changed little on balance, but most longer-term rates have edged higher.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on January 18, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 per cent, 7 to 10 per cent, and 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 per cent, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 1976 to the fourth quarter of 1977 appears to be consistent with these objectives.-6 - 3/15/77These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage nearterm rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph.  Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the March-April period to be within the ranges of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent for M-1 and 7 to 11 per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly average Federal funds rate of about 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the mid-points of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 per cent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  Consideration was then given to the continuing authorizations of the Committee, in accordance with the customary practice of reviewing such matters at the first meeting in March of every year.  Secretary's note: On February 25, 1977, certain continuing authorizations of the Committee, listed below, had been distributed by the Secretary with the advice that, in accordance with procedures approved by the-7 - 3/15/77Committee, they were being called to the Committee's attention before the March organization meeting to give members an opportunity to raise any questions they had concerning them. Members were asked to so indicate if they wished to have any of the authorizations in question placed on the agenda for consideration at this meeting, and no such requests were received.  The authorizations in question were as follows: 1. Procedures for allocation of securities in the System Open Market Account.  2. List of Treasury Department officials to whom weekly reports on open market operations may be sent.  3. Authority for the Chairman to appoint a Federal Reserve Bank as agent to operate the System Account in case the New York Bank is unable to function.  4. Resolutions providing for continued operation of the Committee and for certain actions by the Reserve Banks during an emergency.  5. Resolution relating to examinations of the System Open Market Account.  6. Guidelines for the conduct of System operations in Federal agency issues.  7. Regulation relating to Open Market Operations of Federal Reserve Banks.  8. Rules of Organization, Rules Regarding Availability of Information, and Rules of Procedure.  It was agreed that the authorization for the lending of Government securities from the System Open Market Account,-8 - 3/15/77contained in paragraph 3 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, should be retained at this time, subject to annual review.  By unanimous vote, paragraph 1(b) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, relating to outright purchases and sales of bankers' acceptances, was amended, effective immediately, by adding the words "when appropriate" at the beginning of the paragraph and by reducing the dollar limit on holdings, specified at the end of the paragraph, from $1 billion to $100 million.  In connection with this action, it was understood that present outright holdings of bankers' acceptances would be allowed to mature without replacement and that, while this process was under way, actual holdings would exceed the newly established limit of $100 million for a few months.  By unanimous vote, the paragraphs of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations not affected by the preceding actions were reaffirmed. Reflecting the amendment to paragraph 1(b), the authorization reads as follows:-9 - 3/15/77-10 -AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS 1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee: (a) To buy or sell U.

S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; provided that the aggregate amount of U. S.  Government and Federal agency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments) at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not be increased or decreased by more than $3.0 billion during the period commencing with the opening of business on the day following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting; (b) When appropriate, to buy or sell in the open market, from or to acceptance dealers and foreign accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at market discount rates, prime bankers' acceptances with maturities of up to nine months at the time of acceptance that (1) arise out of the current shipment of goods between countries or within the United States, or (2) arise out of the storage within the United States of goods under contract of sale or expected to move into the channels of trade within a reasonable time and that are secured throughout their life by a warehouse receipt or similar document conveying title to the underlying goods; provided that the aggregate amount of bankers' acceptances held at any one time shall not exceed $100 million; 3/15/77(c) To buy U. S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, and prime bankers' acceptances of the types authorized for purchase under 1(b) above, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities, obligations, or acceptances in 15 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account; and provided further that in the event bankers' acceptances covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the seller, they shall continue to be held by the Federal Reserve Bank or shall be sold in the open market.  2. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or,under special circumstances, such as when the New York Reserve Bank is closed, any other Federal Reserve Bank, to purchase directly from the Treasury for its own account (with discretion, in cases where it seems desirable, to issue participations to one or more Federal Reserve Banks) such amounts of special short-term certificates of indebtedness as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury; provided that the rate charged on such certificates shall be a rate 1/4 of 1 per cent below the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of such purchases, and provided further that the total amount of such certificates held at any one time by the Federal Reserve Banks shall not exceed $2 billion.  3. In order to insure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Banks to lend U. S.  Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as the Committee may specify from time to time.-11 - 3/15/77-12 -By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations shown below was reaffirmed: AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS 1.

D. To maintain an over-all open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding $1.0 billion, unless a larger position is expressly authorized by the Committee.  For this purpose, the over-all open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of open positions in each currency. The open position in a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i. e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.  2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements ("swap" arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity:-13 - 3/15/77-14 -Amount of arrangement (Millions of Foreign bank dollars equivalent) Austrian National Bank 250 National Bank of Belgium 1,000 Bank of Canada 2,000 National Bank of Denmark 250 Bank of England 3,000 Bank of France 2,000 German Federal Bank 2,000 Bank of Italy 3,000 Bank of Japan 2,000 Bank of Mexico 360 Netherlands Bank 500 Bank of Norway 250 Bank of Sweden 300 Swiss National Bank 1,400 Bank for International Settlements: Dollars against Swiss francs 600 Dollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs 1, 250 Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  3.

Apart from any such purchases at the rate of the drawing, all transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1(A) above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates. 3/15/774.
