By unanimous vote the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP is growing at a relatively rapid pace in the current quarter, although the rate of expansion appears to have moderated since the spring and summer.  In October, industrial production increased appreciably, following large gains in previous months. Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further and the civilian unemployment rate declined 1/2 percentage-3- 11/14-15/83point to 8.8 percent. After changing little on balance during the summer months, retail sales strengthened in September and October. Housing starts and permits declined in September while home sales rose somewhat.  Recent data on new orders and shipments indicate further strength in the demand for business equipment.  Producer and consumer prices have continued to increase at about the same pace as in other recent months. The index of average hourly earnings rose somewhat more in September and October than in previous months but over the first ten months of the year the index has risen more slowly than in 1982.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar has risen since early October against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies. The U.S. foreign trade deficit increased considerably in the third quarter, with imports, especially of petroleum, rising faster than exports.  After slowing substantially over the summer months, growth in M2 accelerated in October, while M3 continued to expand at a moderate rate. Through October M2 was at a level in the lower portion of the Committee's range for 1983 and M3 in the upper portion of its range. M1 continued to grow at a sluggish pace in October and was in the lower portion of the Committee's monitoring range for the second half of the year. Longer-term market rates have risen somewhat on balance since early October, and short-term rates generally have fluctuated in a narrow range.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in July the Committee reconsidered the growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates established earlier for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives and set tentative ranges for 1984. The Committee recognized that the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals have become less predictable; that the impact of new deposit accounts on growth of the monetary aggregates cannot be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts may be reflected in some changes in the historical trends in velocity. 11/14-15/83Against this background, the Committee at its July meeting reaffirmed the following growth ranges for the broader aggregates: for the period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The Committee also agreed on tentative growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The Committee considered that growth of M1 in a range of 5 to 9 percent from the second quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, and in a range of 4 to 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984, would be consistent with the ranges for the broader aggregates. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent for 1983 and tentatively set at 8 to 11 percent for 1984.  In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would continue to be placed on the behavior of the broader monetary aggregates. The behavior of M1 and total domestic nonfinancial debt will be monitored, with the degree of weight placed on M1 over time dependent on evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more predictable patterns. The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain the existing degree of reserve restraint. The action is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of around 8-1/2 percent from September to December, consistent with the targets established for these aggregates for the year.  Depending on evidence about the continuing strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly; lesser restraint might be acceptable in the context of a significant shortfall 11/14-15/83in growth of the aggregates from current expectations.  Given the relatively slow growth in October, the Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual rate of around 5 to 6 percent from September to December will be consistent with its fourth-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates, and that expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt would remain within the range established for the year.  The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, December 20, 1983.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
