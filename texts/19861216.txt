By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period November 5, 1986, through December 15, 1986, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity continues to grow at a moderate pace in the current quarter. Total nonfarm payroll employment grew appreciably further in October and November, and employment in manufacturing also rose after declining on balance in previous months. The civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.0 percent in November for the third consecutive month. Industrial production picked up considerably in November. Total retail sales rose moderately last month after changing 12/15-16/86little on balance over September and October. Housing starts have weakened and business capital spending generally appears to have remained sluggish. Preliminary data for the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in October suggest a moderate narrowing. Broad measures of prices have firmed somewhat in recent months due to developments in food and energy markets.  Labor cost increases this year have remained moderate compared with other recent years.  Growth of M2 slowed substantially in November, while growth of M3 remained moderate. Expansion of these two aggregates for the year through November has been just below the upper end of their respective ranges established by the Committee for 1986. In November growth of M1 accelerated to a very rapid rate. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remains appreciably above the Committee's monitoring range for 1986. Short-term interest rates have risen somewhat since the November 5 meeting of the Committee, while long-term rates have declined on balance. In foreign exchange markets the trade-weighted value of the dollar against other G-10 currencies has declined moderately on balance since the November meeting.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at the July meeting to reaffirm the ranges established in February for growth of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986. With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on the experience of recent years, the behavior of that aggregate is subject to substantial uncertainties in relation to economic activity and prices, depending among other things on the responsiveness of M1 growth to changes in interest rates. In light of these uncertainties and of the substantial decline in velocity in the first half of the year, the Committee decided that growth of M1 in excess of the previously established 3 to 8 percent range for 1986 would be acceptable. Acceptable growth of M1 over the remainder of the year would depend on the behavior of 12/15-16/86velocity, growth in the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and price pressures. Given its rapid growth in the early part of the year, the Committee recognized that the increase in total domestic nonfinancial debt in 1986 may exceed its monitoring range of 8 to 11 percent, but felt an increase in that range would provide an inappropriate benchmark for evaluating longer-term trends in that aggregate.  For 1987 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987, of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M2 and M3. While a range of 3 to 8 percent for M1 in 1987 would appear appropriate in the light of most historical experience, the Committee recognized that the exceptional uncertainties surrounding the behavior of M1 velocity over the more recent period would require careful appraisal of the target range at the beginning of 1987. The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 8 to 11 percent for 1987.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from November to March at an annual rate of about 7 percent. Growth in M1 will continue to be appraised in the light of the behavior of M2 and M3 and the other factors cited below. Slightly greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on February 10-11, 1987.  The meeting adjourned.Assistant Secretary
