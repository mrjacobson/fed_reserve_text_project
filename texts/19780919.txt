Wallich and Willes dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services has grown moderately in the current quarter, although the pace is somewhat below the average for the first two quarters of the year. In August the dollar value of total retail sales rose, after having declined in July, but remained close to the level reached in April. Industrial production continued to expand at about the moderate pace of the preceding 3 months, and nonfarm payroll employment rose somewhat further. The unemployment rate declined from 6.2 to 5.9 per cent, slightly below the average rate in the first 7 months of the year. Since midyear average prices of goods and services have risen less rapidly than earlier, in large part because of declines in prices of foods. The advance in the index of average hourly earnings has been somewhat faster so far in 1978 than it had been on the average during 1977.  After a sharp decline in early August, the tradeweighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has recovered against a background of uncertain conditions in exchange markets. In late August it was announced that the U. S. trade deficit had increased sharply in July.  Growth in M-1 picked up in August to about the average rate in the first two quarters of the year.  Inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 and M-3 also accelerated somewhat, and expansion in the broader aggregates was relatively rapid.  Short-term market interest rates have risen appreciably since mid-August, but longer-term rates-4 - 9/19/78generally have edged down further. On August 18 an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 7-1/4 to 7-3/4 per cent was announced.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 18, 1978, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the second quarter of 1978 to the second quarter of 1979 at rates within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 per cent, 6-1/2 to 9 per cent, and 7-1/2 to 10 per cent, respectively.  The associated range for bank credit is 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 per cent. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short-run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to developing conditions in domestic and international financial markets more generally.  Early in the period until the next regular meeting, System open market operations shall be directed at attaining a weekly-average Federal funds rate slightly above the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly-average Federal funds rate within the range of 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 per cent. In deciding on the specific objective for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the September-October period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 5 to 9 per cent for M-1 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 per cent for M-2. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be significantly above or below the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate shall be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.-5 - 9/19/78 -6 If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, October 17, 1978, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
