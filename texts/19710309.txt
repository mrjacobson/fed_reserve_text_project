Secretary's Note: It had been agreed at the meeting on March 10, 1970, that certain authorizations among those that the Committee had reviewed annually in the past would remain effective until otherwise directed by the Committee, and would no longer be submitted routinely for review each year. Instead,it was understood that these authorizations would be called to the Committee's attention before the first meeting in March of each year and that members would be given 3/9/71an opportunity to raise any questions they had concerning them. Accordingly, copies of the authorizations in question (listcd below) had been distributed to the Committee on January 21, 1971, with a request that the members advise the Secretariat if they wished to have any placed on the agenda for consideration at today's meeting.  No such requests were received.  The authorizations in question were as follows: 1. Procedure for allocations of securities in the System Open Market Account.  2. Distribution list for periodic reports prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  3.

It shall be the practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.

The Chairman (and in his absence the Vice Chairman of the Committee, and in the absence of both, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors) is authorized: A.

The Special Manager of the System Open Market Account for foreign currency operations shall keep the Committee informed on conditions in foreign exchange markets and on transactions he has made and shall render such reports as the Committee may specify.  By unanimous vote, the foreign currency directive shown below was reaffirmed: FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE 1. The basic purposes of System operations in foreign currencies are: A. To help safeguard the value of the dollar in international exchange markets; B. To aid in making the system of international payments more efficient; C. To further monetary cooperation with central banks of other countries having convertible currencies, with the International Monetary Fund, and with other international payments institutions; D. To help insure that market movements in exchange rates, within the limits stated in the International Monetary Fund Agreement or established by central bank practices. reflect the interaction of underlying economic forces and thus serve as efficient guides to current financial decisions, private and public; and 3/9/71E. To facilitate growth in international liquidity in accordance with the needs of an expanding world economy.  2. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee, System operations in foreign currencies shall be undertaken only when necessary: A. To cushion or moderate fluctuations in the flows of international payments if such fluctuations (1) are deemed to reflect transitional market unsettlement or other temporary forces and therefore are expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future; and (2) are deemed to be disequilibrating or otherwise to have potentially destabilizing effects on U.S. or foreign official reserves or on exchange markets, for example, by occasioning market anxieties, undesirable speculative activity, or excessive leads and lags in international payments; B. To temper and smooth out abrupt changes in spot exchange rates, and to moderate forward premiums and discounts judged to be disequilibrating.  Whenever supply or demand persists in influencing exchange rates in one direction. System transactions should be modified or curtailed unless upon review and reassessment of the situation the Committee directs otherwise; C. To aid in avoiding disorderly conditions in exchange markets. Special factors that might make for exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to short-run increases in international political tension, (2) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, and (3) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions. Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the Special Manager reaches a judgment that they may help to reestablish supply and demand balance at a level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments. In such cases, the Special Manager shall consult as soon as practicable with the Committee or,-14- in an emergency, with the members of the Subcommittee designated for that purpose in paragraph 6 of the Authorization for System foreign currency operations; and D. To adjust System balances within the limits established in the Authorization for System foreign currency operations in light of probable future needs for currencies.  3. System drawings under the swap arrangements are appropriate when necessary to obtain foreign currencies for the purposes stated in paragraph 2 above.  4. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, transactions in forward exchange, either outright or in conjunction with spot transactions, may be undertaken only (i) to prevent forward premiums or discounts from giving rise to disequilibrating movements of short-term funds; (ii) to minimize speculative disturbances; (iii) to supplement existing market supplies of forward cover, directly or indirectly, as a means of encouraging the retention or accumulation of dollar holdings by private foreign holders; (iv) to allow greater flexibility in covering System or Treasury commitments, including commitments under swap arrangements, and to facilitate operations of the Stabilization Fund; (v) to facilitate the use of one currency for the settlement of System or Treasury commitments denoninated in other currencies; and (vi) to provide cover for System holdings of foreign currencies.  By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 9 through March 8, 1971, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period February 9 through March 8, 1971, were approved, ratified,and confirmed.3/9/71-15- By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services, which declined in the fourth quarter of 1970, is rising in the current quarter primarily because of the resumption of higher automobile production. Although the unemployment rate has edged down recently, it remains high. Wage rates in most sectors are continuing to rise at a rapid pace.  Movements in major price measures have been diverse; most recently, the rate of advance moderated for consumer prices and wholesale prices of industrial commodities, but wholesale prices of farm products and foods rose sharply. Bank credit increased considerably further in February, as business loans strengthened substantially and banks again made sizeable additions to their holdings of securities. The money stock both narrowly and broadly defined expanded sharply in February.  Short-term interest rates and mortgage rates have fallen further in recent weeks but yields on new issues of corporate and municipal bonds have risen considerably, in part as a result of the very heavy calendar of offerings. The over-all balance of payments deficit in January and February was exceptionally large. Imports increased more rapidly than exports in January, and capital outflows have been stimulated by widened shortterm interest rate differentials. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the resumption of sustainable economic growth, while encouraging an orderly reduction in the rate of inflation and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining prevailing money market conditions while accommodating3/9/71-16- any downward movements in long-term rates; provided that money market conditions shall be modified if it appears that the monetary and credit aggregates are deviating significantly from the growth paths expected.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, April 6, 1971, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary3/9/71-17-
