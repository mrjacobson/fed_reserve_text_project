By unanimous vote, an adjustment in the exchange rate on the System's outstanding Swiss franc swap debt, to reflect the December 1971 Smithsonian realignment of currency values and the February 1973 devaluation of the dollar, was authorized.  By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period November 18 through December 15, 1975, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that output of goods and services--which had increased very sharply in the third quarter--is expanding more moderately in the current quarter. In November the rise in industrial production and in nonfarm payroll employment slowed further. The dollar volume of retail sales rose again, however, and residential construction activity expanded, reflecting recent substantial increases in private housing starts. The unemployment rate--which had risen 0.3 percentage points to 8.6 per cent in October--fell back to 8.3 per cent in November, reflecting a sizable decline in the civilian labor force. The 12/16/75increase in average wholesale prices of industrial commodities, although below that in October, was still relatively large; prices of farm products declined appreciably, following 2 months of large increases.  The advance in average wage rates in November was again substantial.  The exchange value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has risen somewhat since mid-November. The net outflow of bank-reported private capital appears to have declined from the high rate reported for October. In October the U.S. foreign trade surplus remained substantial.  M1--which had declined in October--rose sharply in Novemer. Growth in M2 and M3 was substantial, as inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to banks strengthened while inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained relatively favorable. Long-term interest rates have fluctuated in a narrow range in recent weeks, while short-term market rates have risen somewhat.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to maintain prevailing bank reserve and money market conditions over the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates currently expected.  By unanimous vote, transfer to the National Archives of the FOMC memoranda of discussion for 1970, on the basis described in memoranda from the Secretariat dated December 4, 1975, wasauthorized. 12/16/75 -5It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on January 20, 1976.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
