By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that expansion in real economic activity, after moderating slightly in the first quarter, has continued at about the same pace since then. Substantial upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Market interest rates have fluctuated widely recently, partly because of varying expectations, although credit demands remain relatively strong. Short-term rates on balance have continued under upward pressure, against the background of considerable restraint on the banking system.  In June bank credit showed little change, after allowance for assets sold to affiliates and to customers with bank guarantees. Growth in the money supply resumed at a slow pace, and the run-off of large-denomination CD's which began in mid-December continued without abatement.  There apparently were substantial net outflows from consumer-type time and savings accounts at banks and 7/15/69nonbank thrift institutions around midyear, following a period of slackened growth. The over-all balance of payments deficit on the liquidity basis rose sharply in the second quarter; there were large outflows into German marks and into Euro-dollar deposits, and there was no significant improvement in net exports. In contrast, there was another large surplus on the official settlements basis as U.S. banks borrowed heavily in the Euro-dollar market. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging a more sustainable rate of economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury refunding, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the currently prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified, to the extent permitted by the Treasury refunding, if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, August 12, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Deputy Secretary
