By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that the pace of expansion in real economic activity was sustained in the third quarter by an acceleration of inventory investment, which about offset a further slackening in growth of private final sales. Slower over-all growth is projected for the fourth quarter, although some cross-currents have been evident in the recent behavior of monthly economic measures. Prices and costs are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. Most market interest rates have declined considerably on balance from their recent highs, in large part because of changing expectations. In the third quarter, average monthly bank credit declined and the money supply changed little; in October it appears that bank credit is decreasing further on average but that the money supply is growing somewhat. In recent weeks the net contraction of outstanding large-denomination CD's slowed markedly, apparently reflecting mainly an increase in foreign official time deposits, but flows of consumer-type time and savings funds at banks and nonbank thrift institutions appear to have remained relatively weak. The U.S. foreign trade surplus increased further in September, but the deficit in the over-all balance of payments was still large on the liquidity basis and even larger on the official settlements basis. The appreciation of the German mark since the end of September, culminating in the revaluation of the official parity, has led to a partial reversal of speculative flows, and conditions in the Euro-dollar market have eased. In light of 10/28/69the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging sustainable economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, November 25, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary-5-
