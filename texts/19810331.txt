For this purpose, the overall open position in all-5 - 3/31/81foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies.

The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements ("swap" arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity: Amount of arrangement (millions of dollars Foreign bank equivalent) Austrian National Bank 250 National Bank of Belgium 1,000 Bank of Canada 2,000 National Bank of Denmark 250 Bank of England 3,000 Bank of France 2,000 German Federal Bank 6,000 Bank of Italy 3,000 Bank of Japan 5,000 Bank of Mexico 700 Netherlands Bank 500 Bank of Norway 250 Bank of Sweden 500 1/ Swiss National Bank 4,000 Bank for International Settlements: Dollars against Swiss francs 600 Dollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs 1,250 Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  1/ Pursuant to an action taken by the Committee on May 20, 1980, the amount of the reciprocal currency arrangement with the Bank of Sweden was raised to $500 million, effective May 23, 1980, for a period of one year, after which it will revert to its former level of $300 million.-6 - 3/31/813. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1(A) above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates.

By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed the agreement of January 17, 1977, to "warehouse" foreign currencies for the Exchange Stabilization Fund and for the Treasury on the terms agreed upon by the Committee at its meeting on March 18, 1980, with the understanding that the agreement would be subject to annual review.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period February 2 through March 30, 1981, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations shown below was reaffirmed: AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS 1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee: (a) To buy or sell U. S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U. S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; provided that the aggregate amount of U. S. Government and Federal agency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments) at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action is taen with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not be increased or decreased by more than $3.0 billion during the period commencing with the opening of business on the day following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting; 3/31/81-11 -(b) When appropriate, to buy or sell in the open market, from or to acceptance dealers and foreign accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at market discount rates, prime bankers acceptances with maturities of up to nine months at the time of acceptance that (1) arise out of the current shipment of goods between countries or within the United States, or (2) arise out of the storage within the United States of goods under contract of sale or expected to move into the channels of trade within a reasonable time and that are secured throughout their life by a warehouse receipt or similar document conveying title to the underlying goods; provided that the aggregate amount of bankers acceptances held at any one time shall not exceed $100 million; (c) To buy U. S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, and prime bankers acceptances of the types authorized for purchase under 1(b) above, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities, obligations, or acceptances in 15 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account; and provided further that in the event bankers acceptances covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the seller, they shall continue to be held by the Federal Reserve Bank or shall be sold in the open market.  2. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or, under special circumstances, such as when the New York Reserve Bank is closed, any other Federal Reserve Bank) (a) to lend to the Treasury such amounts of securities held in the System Open Market Account as may be necesary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, under such conditions as the Committee may specify; and (b) to purchase directly from the Treasury for renewable periods not to exceed thirty days, when authorized by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to an affirmative vote of not less than five members, for its own account (with discretion, in cases where it seems desirable, to issue participations to one or more Federal Reserve Banks) such amounts of special short-term certificates of indebtedness as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, provided that the rate charged on such certificates shall be a rate 1/4 of 1 percent below the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of such purchases and provided that the total amount of such certificates held at any one time by the Federal Reserve Banks shall not exceed $2 billion. 3/31/81-12 -3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Banks to lend U. S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to Government securites dealers and to banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as the Committee may specify from time to time.  4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U. S. Government securities to such foreign and international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph 1(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph 1(c), repurchase agreements in U. S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.  It was agreed that the authorization for the lending of Government securities from the System Open Market Account, contained in paragraph 3 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, should be retained at this time, subject to annual review.  With Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP,expanded substantially in the first quarter of 1981, but there were signs of a slowing of the expansion in economic activity during the quarter; prices on the average continued to rise rapidly. While retail sales advanced appreciably over the first two months of the year, industrial production declined in February after three months of diminishing gains and housing starts dropped from the moderate pace that had prevailed during the preceding six months. Nonfarm payroll employment changed little in February following a large increase in January; the unemployment rate, at 7.3 percent, was essentially unchanged. Over the first two months of 1981, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was little changed from the rapid pace recorded during 1980. 3/31/81The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose further following the Committee's meeting in early February to a peak at midmonth but subsequently declined somewhat on balance. Short-term interest rates in continental European countries have risen appreciably since mid-February, absolutely and in relation to interest rates on dollar-denominated assets. The U.S. trade deficit in January and February was at about the average monthly rate of the final quarter of 1980.  M-1A and M-1B, adjusted for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, changed little over the first two months of the year but expanded substantially in the first half of March. Growth in M-2 accelerated in the course.of the quarter and partial data suggest considerable strength in March, in part because of large flows into money market mutual funds. On balance since early February, short-term market interest rates have fallen substantially while longerterm market rates have risen somewhat.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 within ranges of 3 to 5-1/2 percent, 3-1/2 to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis.  The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.  In the short-run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth in M-1B from March to June at an annual rate of 5-1/2 percent or somewhat less, after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts, and growth in M-2 at an annual rate of about 10-1/2 percent. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M-1B to an unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions. If it appears during the period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal funds rate, taken over a period of time, within a range of 13 to 18 percent are likely to be inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.-13 - 3/31/81 -14 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 19, 1981, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.
