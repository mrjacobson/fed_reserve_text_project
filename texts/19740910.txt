The following actions were taken during the part of the meeting in which staff attendance was limited. Messrs. Coombs and Coyne joined the meeting prior to these actions.  By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period August 20 through September 9, 1974, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, renewal for further periods of 3 months of two System drawings on the National Bank of Belgium, maturing on October 15 and 18, 1974, respectively, was authorized.  With Mr. Hayes dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is changing little in the current quarter, following the first-half decline, and that price and wage increases are continuing large. In August industrial production, according to preliminary indications, remained near the level of recent months, while the unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 per cent. Wholesale prices of farm products rose further, on average, and announcements of increases for industrial commodities continued numerous. 9/10/74In recent weeks the dollar has continued to appreciate against leading foreign currencies. U.S. bank lending to foreign borrowers diminished in July and apparently also in August, while inflows from abroad increased. The foreign trade deficit, which had narrowed in June, widened in July.  In August growth of the narrowly defined money stock was above the low pace of July but well below the 6 per cent annual rate of the first half of the year. Net inflows of time deposits other than money market CD's continued at about the July rate, but the performance of passbook savings at banks--and of total deposits at nonbank thrift institutions-remained weak. Although growth in business loans remained relatively strong in August, growth in total bank credit was moderate, and banks reduced their reliance on large-denomination CD's and nondeposit funds. Interest rates on most shortterm market instruments have changed little on balance since mid-August, while rates on most types of longer-term securities have risen further. On September 4 the Federal Reserve announced the removal of the 3 per cent marginal reserve requirement on longer-term, large-denomination CD's.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, supporting a resumption of real economic growth, and achieving equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be on October 15, 1974, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
