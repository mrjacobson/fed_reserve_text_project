By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period January 9 through February 5, 1968, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that over-all economic activity has been expanding rapidly, with both industrial and consumer prices rising at a substantial rate, and that prospects are for continuing rapid growth and persisting inflationary pressures in the period ahead. The imbalance in U.S.  international transactions worsened further in late 1967, primarily because of a sharp reduction in the surplus on merchandise trade. Although day-to-day money market rates have remained firm, rates on other short-term instruments have declined recently; meanwhile, long-term bond yields have fluctuated irregularly below the peaks reached late last year. Growth in bank credit resumed in January, reflecting both loan expansion around the year end and Treasury financing. The money supply expanded sharply following earlier slackening, but flows into time and savings accounts at bank and nonbank financial intermediaries have continued to moderate. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resistance of inflationary pressures and progress toward reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments. 2/6/68To implement this policy, while taking account of Treasury financing activity, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining firm conditions in the money market, and operations shall be modified to the extent permitted by Treasury financing if bank credit appears to be expanding as rapidly as is currently projected.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee, which would be the annual organizational meeting, would be held on Tuesday, March 5, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
