By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that expansion in real economic activity has moderated only slightly since the fourth quarter of 1968. At the same time, substantial upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Long-term interest rates have generally declined in recent weeks, but most short-term rates have risen somewhat. In the first quarter of the year bank credit changed little on average and the money supply grew at a sharply reduced rate. In early April both measures increased substantially, influenced in part by large tax-date borrowing and deposit bulges around Easter. The outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's has continued to decline and there was a net outflow of consumer-type time and savings 4/29/69deposits from banks and other thrift institutions in the first half of April. A sizable deficit reemerged in the U. S. balance of payments on the liquidity basis in the first quarter but the balance on the official settlements basis remained in surplus as a result of large inflows of Euro-dollars. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging a more sustainable rate of economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury refunding, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified, to the extent permitted by the Treasury refunding, if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 27, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
