Secretary's Note: On March 14, 1968, the Committee had authorized negotiations looking toward increases in a number of System swap lines, on the understanding that any such increases 10/8/68 -3would become effective upon a determination by Chairman Martin that they were in the national interest. As a result of a determination by Chairman Martin on October 8, 1968, that an increase in the swap line with the Bank of Italy from $750 million to $1 billion equivalent was in the national interest, the table contained in paragraph 2 of the authorization for System foreign currency operations was amended, effective immediately, to read as follows: Amount of arrangement (millions of Foreign bank dollars equivalent) Austrian National Bank 100 National Bank of Belgium 225 Bank of Canada 1,000 National Bank of Denmark 100 Bank of England 2,000 Bank of France 700 German Federal Bank 1,000 Bank of Italy 1,000 Bank of Japan 1,000 Bank of Mexico 130 Netherlands Bank 400 Bank of Norway 100 Bank of Sweden 250 Swiss National Bank 600 Bank for International Settlements: System drawings in Swiss francs 600 System drawings in authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs 1,000 Also, on September 24, 1968, under the terms of the Committee's action of July 16, 1968, Chairman Martin had determined that an increase of $650 million, to $1 billion equivalent, in the limit on outstanding System forward commitments to deliver foreign 10/8/68currencies to the Stabilization Fund was in the national interest.  Accordingly, paragraph 1C(1) of the authorization for System foreign currency operations was amended, effective September 24, 1968, to read as follows: Commitments to deliver foreign currencies to the Stabilization Fund, up to $1 billion equivalent.  By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period September 10 through October 7, 1968, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  With Messrs. Hayes, Hickman, and Kimbrel dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that over-all economic expansion has moderated, although less than projected, from its very rapid pace earlier in the year, but upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Most market interest rates have changed little on balance in recent weeks. Bank credit and time and savings deposits expanded rapidly this summer, but the money supply has shown no net growth since July after rising substantially for several months. The earlier improvement in the U.S. balance of payments was not maintained in August and September, according to preliminary indications, and the foreign trade balance and underlying payments position continue to be matters of serious concern. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable economic growth, 10/8/68 -5continued resistance to inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the prevailing conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified, to the extent permitted by the forthcoming Treasury refunding operation, if bank credit expansion appears to be significantly exceeding current projections.  It was agreed that the Secretariat for the current TreasuryFederal Reserve study of the U.S. Government securities market should be continued on a permanent basis, with responsibility for continuing study of the operations and functioning of the U.S.  Government securities market.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, October 29, 1968, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
