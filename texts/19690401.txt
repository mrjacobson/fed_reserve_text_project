With Messrs. Coldwell and Maisel dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that, while expansion in real economic activity has moderated somewhat further, current and prospective activity now appears stronger than earlier projections had indicated. Substantial upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Most long-term interest rates have risen further on balance in recent weeks, but movements in short-term rates have been mixed. In the first quarter of the year bank credit changed little on average, as investments contracted while loans expanded further. In March the outstanding volume of largedenomination CD's continued to decline sharply; inflows of other time and savings deposits were moderate; and growth in the money supply remained at a sharply reduced rate. It appears that a sizable deficit reemerged in 4/1/69the U.S. balance of payments on the liquidity basis in the first quarter but that the balance on the official settlements basis remained in surplus as a result of further large inflows of Euro-dollars. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging a more sustainable rate of economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets, taking account of the effects of other possible monetary policy action; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, April 29, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
