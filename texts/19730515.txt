By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period April 17 through May 14, 1973, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period April 17 through May 14, 1973, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services is likely to moderate somewhat in the current quarter from an exceptionally rapid pace in the two preceding quarters. Over the first 4 months of this year, employment rose considerably but the unemployment rate remained about 5 per cent. Retail prices of foods continued upward at an extraordinary pace in March, and in April average wholesale prices of consumer foods rose further.  Increases in wholesale prices of industrial commodities were large and widespread in April, as in the two preceding months. In foreign exchange markets, which had been relatively quiet since mid-March, speculative pressures have developed in recent days and exchange rates for major European currencies have appreciated 5/15/73against the dollar. The U.S. merchandise trade balance improved considerably in the first quarter, reflecting in part an especially large increase in agricultural exports.  In April growth in the narrowly defined money stock picked up from its low first-quarter rate, and growth in the broadly defined money stock also increased.  Growth in business loans at banks slowed, and banks reduced the pace at which they issued large-denomination CD's; consequently, the bank credit proxy expanded somewhat less than in other recent months. In recent weeks Federal Reserve Bank discount rates have been increased in two steps of one-quarter point to 6 per cent by May 11. Most short-term market interest rates, which had risen sharply earlier, have advanced slightly further. Interest rates on long-term market securities have been relatively stable.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to abatement of inflationary pressures, a more sustainable rate of advance in economic activity, and progress toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of international and domestic financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with somewhat slower growth in monetary aggregates over the months immediately ahead than occurred on average in the past 6 months.  By unanimous vote, paragraphs (a) and (d) of Section 4 of the Committee's Rules of Organization were amended, effective June 1, 1973, to read as follows: SEC. 4. Staff. (a) Selection of staff officers.  At its first meeting on or after March 1 of each year, the Committee selects, from among the officers and employees of the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks, the following staff officers to serve until the first meeting on or after March 1 of the next following year: Secretary, 5/15/73Deputy Secretary, and one or more Assistant Secretaries; General Counsel, Deputy General Counsel, and one or more Assistant General Counsel; and Economists, one or more of whom may be designated as Senior or Associate Economists or given titles reflecting their areas of particular specialization.  * * * * * (d) General Counsel and Deputy and Assistant General Counsel. The General Counsel furnishes such legal advice as the Committee may require.  In the absence of the General Counsel, the Deputy General Counsel or an Assistant General Counsel acts as General Counsel pro ten.  By unanimous vote, Thomas J. O'Connell, Edward G. Guy, and John Nicoll were elected General Counsel, Deputy General Counsel, and Assistant General Counsel, respectively, of the Federal Open Market Committee, effective June 1, 1973, to serve until the election of their successors at the first meeting of the Committee after February 28, 1974, with the understanding that in the event of the discontinuance of their official connection with the Board of Governors or with a Federal Reserve Bank, as the case might be, they would cease to have any official connection with the Federal Open Market Committee.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Monday and Tuesday, June 18-19, 1973, beginning on the afternoon of June 18.  The meeting adjourned.
