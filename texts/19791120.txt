By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is declining in the current quarter, after the thirdquarter rebound, and that prices on the average are continuing to rise rapidly. Retail sales, which had expanded sharply during the third quarter in both constant and current dollars, dropped in October.  Industrial production remained near its midyear level. Nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably, after three months of little growth, but the unemployment rate increased from 5.8 to 6.0 percent.  Producer prices of finished goods continued to rise rapidly in October, in part because of further sharp increases in energy items and the spreading effects of earlier increases in energy costs. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings during the first 10 months of the year was close to the rapid pace during 1978.  On October 6 the Federal Reserve announced a series of complementary actions directed toward assuring control over the expansion.of money and bank credit and toward curbing speculative excesses in commodity and financial markets, including foreign exchange markets. The actions included an increase in Federal Reserve Bank discount rates from 11 percent to 12 percent; establishment of a marginal reserve requirement on increases in the total of managed liabilities of member banks, Edge corporations, and U. S. agencies and branches of foreign banks; and a shift in the conduct of open market operations to an approach placing greater emphasis in day-to-day operations on the supply of bank reserves and less emphasis on confining short-term fluctuations in the federal funds rate.-4 - 11/20/79Following the announcement on October 6, the downward pressure on the dollar in the exchange markets that had developed in September was reversed, and by the end of October the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies had risen about 3-1/2 percent. In mid-November, however, the value of the dollar declined, reflecting in part developments concerning Iran. The U. S. foreign trade deficit increased in September as the cost of oil imports rose, but the deficit was somewhat lower for the third quarter as a whole than for the second quarter.  Growth of M-1, which had accelerated in September and was exceptionally rapid in the third quarter as a whole, slowed sharply in October to an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent. Expansion of interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 remained strong, as a rise in net flows into time deposits at commercial banks in response to increased yields offset a contraction in savings deposits. Inflows of deposits at nonbank thrift institutions slowed somewhat. Flows into money market mutual funds accelerated. Growth of commercial bank credit moderated in October; nevertheless, banks increased their reliance on the negotiable, large-denomination CD's and other managed liabilities that became subject to the marginal reserve requirement in the statement week beginning October 11. Both short- and long-term market interest rates have risen sharply on balance since the early October announcement of the System's policy actions, although most recently rates have declined; mortgage interest rates have increased substantially further.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 11, 1979, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively, the same ranges-5 - 11/20/79that had been established in February. The range for M-1 had been established originally on the basis of an assumption that expansion of ATS and NOW accounts would dampen growth by about 3 percentage points over the year. It now appears that expansion of such accounts will dampen growth by about 1-1/2 percentage points over the year; thus after allowance for the deviation from the earlier estimate, the equivalent range for M-1 is now 3 to 6 percent. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  The Committee anticipates that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980, growth may be within the same ranges, depending upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate adjustments that may be required by legislation or judicical developments affecting interest-bearing transactions accounts. These ranges will be reconsidered at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to restrain expansion of reserve aggregates to a pace consistent with deceleration in growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 in the fourth quarter of 1979 to rates that would hold growth of these monetary aggregates over the whole period from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within the Committee's longer-run ranges, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 11-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the.Committee.  By unanimous vote, responsibility for making determinations with respect to appeals of denial of access to Committee records, under the provisions of 271.4(d) of the-6 - 11/20/79Committee's Rules Regarding Availability of Information, was delegated to Mr. Schultz, and in his absence, to Mr. Coldwell.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Wednesday, January 9, 1980, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary-7 -
