By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was approved with two sets of amendments.  The first set of amendments aimed at sim-plifying the language by defining common terms, elimi-nating duplication of language, and standardizing refer-ences to the Committee.7  The second set of amend-ments clarified or modified existing authority, in partic-ular by introducing part of prudent planning to simplify transfer of authority from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to another Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee in the event of a significant contingency, removing the author-ization to use agents for agency mortgage-backed secu-defining the types of collat-eral accepted in securities lending operations described in paragraph 3, and updating the language relating to the to act in exceptional circumstances.8  The Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations in Federal-Agency Issues remained sus-pended.

The Chairman, whenever feasi-ble, will consult with the Committee before making any instruction under this paragraph 5.  The Committee voted to amend the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Procedural In-structions with Respect to Foreign Currency Opera-tions, and to reaffirm the Foreign Currency Directive in the form shown below.  The approval of these docu-agreement with the U.S. Treasury.  A change was made to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations to increase the duration limit of the foreign currency portfolio to 24 months from 18 months.  This change was made to provide greater flexibility in the manage-ment of the foreign currency portfolio, in an environ-ment in which interest rates are low in many major econ-omies.  Mr. Lacker dissented in the votes on the Author-ization for Foreign Currency Operations and the For-eign Currency Directive to indicate his opposition to for-eign currency intervention by the Federal Reserve.  In his view, such intervention would be ineffective if it did not also signal a shift in domestic monetary policy; and if it did signal such a shift, it could potentially compro-ence.

B. Drawings must be approved by the Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee be-lieves that consultation with the full Committee is  not feasible in the time available, or by the Chair-man, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time availa-ble) if the swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeds the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 per-cent of the size of the swap arrangement.

Would result in a change on any day in the foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with repayment of swap drawings. iii. Might generate a substantial volume of trad-ing in a particular currency by the System, even t position in that currency (as defined in paragraph 1.D of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations) might be less than the limits specified in 3.A.ii. B.

The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to undertake transactions of the type described in para-graphs 1, 2, and 5 of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and foreign exchange and in-vestment transactions that it may be otherwise au-thorized to undertake from time to time for the pur-pose of testing operational readiness.  The aggregate amount of such transactions shall not exceed        $2.5 billion per calendar year.  These transactions shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit-tee.  By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Pro-gram for Security of FOMC Information with changes to how Federal Reserve Banks classify and access Com-mittee information.  In its annual reconsideration of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, partic-ipants generally agreed that only a minor update was re-quired at this meeting.  Several participants observed that this statement had helped to increase public under-standing of the Committework.  It was noted, however, that the Committee should continue to discuss possible enhancements to the statement over the coming year.   Following the discussion, the Committee voted to reaf-firm the statement with an updated reference to partici-pants estimates of the longer-run normal unemploy-ment rate.  Mr. Tarullo abstained because he did not be-lieve the statement reflects sufficient consensus in the principles underlying as to significantly advance public understanding of its monetary policy strategy.    STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY (As amended effective January 27, 2015)  OMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, sta-ble prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci-sions to the public as clearly as possible.  Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncer-tainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan-cial disturbances.  Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag.  Therefore, the longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its as-sessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the  The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de-termined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.  The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expendi-tures, is most consistent over the longer run with the this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep  longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fos-tering price stability and moderate long-term interest maximum employment in the face of significant eco-nomic disturbances. The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.  These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable.  Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Com-olicy decisions must be informed by assess-ments of the maximum level of employment, recogniz-ing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.  The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments.  Infor-longer-run normal rates of output growth and unem-ployment is published four times per year in the ample, in the most recent projections, FOMC partici- estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unem-ployment had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent.  In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from tsessments of its maximum level.  These objectives are generally complementary.  However, under circum-stances in which the Committee judges that the objec-tives are not complementary, it follows a balanced ap-proach in promoting them, taking into account the mag-nitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate. The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual   Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed- In a joint session of the Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial mar-kets.  The deputy manager followed with a review of Sys-tem open market operations conducted during the pe-riod since the Committee met on December 1617, 2014.  The deputy manager also discussed the outcomes of recent tests of term and overnight reverse repurchase agreements (term RRPs and ON RRPs, respectively).  These tests suggested that the combination of term RRP and ON RRP operations had been effective in support-ing money market rates leading into and over year-end.  The presentation also outlined some staff recommenda-tions for further testing of Term Deposit Facility opera-tions. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market ing period.  There were no intervention operations in in-termeeting period. Liftoff Tools and Possible Liftoff Options A staff briefing provided some background on possible options for the use of supplementary tools, in addition to interest on excess reserves (IOER), that the Commit-tee could choose to use during the early stages of policy normalization.  The purpose of these options was to  help ensure sufficient control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates during this period while mitigating potential risks associated with particular policy tools.  The presentation discussed the possibility of establishing, on a temporary basis, an aggregate cap for ON RRP operations that was substantially above the cap the Committee had chosen for the purposes of test-ing such operations.  In addition, the presentation dis-cussed the possible use of term RRP operations, either before or after the commencement of policy firming, as a way to reinforce control of short-term interest rates and to manage the size of the ON RRP program.  Other possible options presented at the briefing included ad-justing the values of the IOER and ON RRP rates asso-ciated with a given target range for the federal funds rate and the use of term deposits.  In their discussion of these issues, participants generally agreed that it was very important for the commencement of policy firming to proceed successfully.  Consequently, most were prepared to take the steps necessary to ensure that the federal funds rate traded within the target range established by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  However, a few participants noted that day-to-day volatility in the federal funds rate, potentially in-cluding temporary movements outside the target range, would not be surprising, and that historical experience suggested that such temporary movements had few, if any, implications for overall financial conditions or the aggregate economy. With regard to the appropriate setting of the cap for ON RRP operations at the beginning of normalization, the staff reported that testing to date suggested that ON RRP operations have generally been successful in estab-lishing a floor on the level of the federal funds effective rate and other short-term interest rates, as long as market participants judge that the aggregate cap is quite unlikely to bind.  Against this backdrop, most meeting partici-pants indicated that a sizable ON RRP cap would be ap-propriate to support policy implementation at the time of liftoff, and a couple of participants suggested that the aggregate cap might be suspended for a time.  A couple of participants expressed continued concerns about the potential risks to financial stability associated with a large ON RRP facility and the possible effect of such a facility on patterns of financial intermediation.  Moreover, some participants were concerned that a decision to allow a temporary increase in the maximum size of the ON RRP facility could be viewed by market participants as a signal that a large ON RRP facility would be maintained for a longer period than those participants deemed appropri-ate.  While acknowledging these concerns, many partici-pants believed that a temporarily elevated cap on the ON RRP operations at a time when the Committee saw con-ditions as appropriate to begin normalization would likely pose limited risks; another participant judged that an ON RRP program was, in any case, unlikely to mate-rially increase the risks to financial stability.  Some par-ticipants noted that a relatively high cap could be estab-lished and then reduced fairly soon after the initial policy firming if it was determined that it was not needed, and that such a reduction could help underscore the Com-mittenecessary.  A number of participants emphasized that the Committee should develop plans to ensure that such a facility is temporary and that it can be phased out once it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate. With regard to the possible use of term RRP operations as an additional supplementary tool, participants noted that recent testing showed that term RRP operations ahead of the year-end were associated with a significant decline in the level of take-up at ON RRP operations.  The staff presentation suggested that risks to financial stability associated with term RRPs could be somewhat lower than those associated with ON RRP operations because term RRP operations would be conducted only on selected dates, the Federal Reserve would set the quantity auctioned, and the rate on term RRPs would be determined by the auction process.  However, a few par-ticipants expressed the view that term RRPs were un-likely to lower risks to financial stability significantly.  In addition, some participants noted that the use of term RRP operations could complicate communications.  A few others observed that the Committee should not de-sign its operations to reduce year-end or quarter-end vol-atility induced by reporting practices.  Nonetheless, many participants agreed that the use of term RRP operations during the period of policy tight-ening could be useful in some situations. With regard to the potential use of other tools, several participants noted that the IOER and ON RRP rates should be set at the top and bottom, respectively, of the target range for the federal funds rate.  To deviate from such a structure would complicate communications about the policy framework and therefore should be avoided if possible.   However, some participants judged that adjustments to the relationship of the IOER rate and the ON RRP rate to the target range for the federal funds rate might, in some circumstances, be helpful for improving control of the federal funds rate.  A few par- ticipants noted that use of term deposits during the tight-ening phase could also be appropriate in some circum-stances.   The staff presentation also discussed a technical issue re-lated to the calculation of the payment of interest on re-serves.  Under current arrangements, an increase in the IOER rate that is implemented in the middle of a reserve maintenance period is not fully reflected in interest pay-ments to depository institutions until the beginning of a new maintenance period.  Participants generally sug-gested that it would be useful for the staff to investigate changes in the method used to determine the interest payments on reserves that could tighten the link between the IOER rate in place each day and the level of reserve balances held by depository institutions each day. At the conclusion of their discussion, participants gen-erally agreed that it would be useful to discuss further at coming meetings specific calibrations of policy tools that could be used during the early stages of policy normali-zation.  In addition, many noted that it would be useful to communicate additional information to the public on these issues to provide greater clarity about the Commit-to policy implementation at that time. A staff briefing outlined two proposals that the Commit-tee could consider for further testing of term RRP oper-ations.  In the first of these proposals, the Desk would conduct a series of preannounced term RRP operations that would span the end of the first quarter.  In the sec-ond proposal, the Desk would conduct small term RRP operations in February and early March, in addition to the quarter-end option presented in the first pro-posal.  In their discussion of term RRP testing, partici-pants noted that the testing could provide further infor-mation about the substitutability between the ON and term RRP operations, including outside year-end and quarter-end periods.  A number of participants empha-sized that, even if the Committee conducted additional tests, it had not yet decided whether to use term RRP operations as part of policy normalization.  Following the discussion of the testing of term RRP operations, the Committee approved the following resolution on term RRP testing over the end of the first quarter of 2015: March 30, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a se-ries of term reverse repurchase operations in-volving U.S. government securities.  Such op-erations shall: (i) mature no later than April 9, 2015; (ii) be subject to an overall size limit of $200 billion outstanding at any one time;      (iii) be subject to a maximum bid rate of five basis points above the ON RRP offering rate in effect on the day of the operation; (iv) be awarded to all submitters: (A) at the highest submitted rate if the sum of the bids received is less than or equal to the preannounced size of the operation, or (B) at the stop-out rate, determined by evaluating bids in ascending order by submitted rate up to the point at which the total quantity of bids equals the pre-announced size of the operation, with all bids below this rate awarded in full at the stop-out rate and all bids at the stop-out rate awarded on a pro rata basis, if the sum of the counter-party offers received is greater than the prean-nounced size of the operation.  Such opera-tions may be for forward settlement.  The Sys-tem Open Market Account manager will in-form the FOMC in advance of the terms of the planned operations.  The Chair must ap-prove the terms of, timing of the announce-ment of, and timing of the operations.  These operations shall be conducted in addition to the authorized overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which remain subject to a sepa-  The Committee also approved the following resolution on testing term RRP operations during February and March:  March 10, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a se-ries of term reverse repurchase operations in-volving U.S. government securities.  Such op-erations shall: (i) mature no later than      March 12, 2015; (ii) be subject to an overall size limit of $50 billion outstanding at any one time; (iii) be subject to a maximum bid rate of five basis points above the ON RRP offering rate in effect on the day of the operation;     (iv) be awarded to all submitters: (A) at the highest submitted rate if the sum of the bids received is less than or equal to the prean-nounced size of the operation, or (B) at the stop-out rate, determined by evaluating bids  in ascending order by submitted rate up to the point at which the total quantity of bids equals the preannounced size of the operation, with all bids below this rate awarded in full at the stop-out rate and all bids at the stop-out rate awarded on a pro rata basis, if the sum of the counterparty offers received is greater than the preannounced size of the operation.  Such operations may be for forward settlement.  The System Open Market Account manager will inform the FOMC in advance of the terms of the planned operations.  The Chair must approve the terms of, timing of the an-nouncement of, and timing of the operations.  These operations shall be conducted in addi-tion to the authorized overnight reverse re-purchase agreements, which remain subject to a separate overall size limit of $300 billion per   Mr. Lacker dissented in the votes on both resolutions because he felt that the testing to date had already pro-vided sufficient information about this tool, and that au-thorizing further testing could encourage the incorrect impression that the Committee had already decided that it would be engaging in term RRP operations during the period of policy normalization. The Board meeting concluded at the end of the discus-sion of liftoff tools and possible liftoff options. Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The information reviewed for the January 2728 meet-ing indicated that economic activity expanded at a solid pace over the second half of 2014, and that labor market conditions had again improved in recent months.  Con-longer-run objective of 2 percent, held down by contin-uing large decreases in energy prices.  While longer-term market-based measures of inflation compensation de-clined substantially in recent months, survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in Decem-ber and the gains for October and November were re-vised up, putting the increase for the fourth quarter above that for the third quarter.  The unemployment rate declined to 5.6 percent in December, the labor force par-ticipation rate decreased, and the employment-to-popu-lation rate was unchanged.  The share of workers em-ployed part time for economic reasons declined.  The rate of private-sector job openings moved up in Novem-ber, while the rates of hiring and of quits edged down but remained well above their year-earlier readings. Industrial production rose at a robust pace in the fourth quarter, with a strong increase in manufacturing output sembly schedules for the first quarter and broader indi-cators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, generally pointed to moderate gains in factory output early this year.  In contrast, some indicators of mining activity, such as counts of drilling rigs in opera-tion, weakened, presumably reflecting the recent sharp declines in energy prices. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ap-peared to have risen at a robust pace over the second half of 2014.  Data on spending in the third quarter were revised up, and the components of nominal retail sales used to construct estimates of PCE rose briskly in the fourth quarter.  Light motor vehicle sales in the fourth quarter maintained their robust third-quarter pace.  Im-portant factors influencing household spending re-mained supportive of further solid gains in real PCE early this year.  Real disposable personal income in-creased in November; since then, continued declines in energy prices likely raised the purchasing power of creased as home values and equity prices advanced, and consumer sentiment, as measured by the Thomson Reu-ters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, moved up in early January to its highest level in more than a decade. The pace of housing market activity improved some-what but remained slow.  Starts of new single-family homes increased in December to their highest level since 2008, and permits for new construction also moved higher.  Starts of multifamily units were unchanged in December and within the range they have been in for the past year.  Sales of new homes increased, on net, in November and December, while sales of existing homes declined, on average, over those two months. Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-tellectual property appeared to decelerate in the fourth quarter.  Nominal orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft, declined in November and December.  Moreover, the level of new orders for these capital goods was only a little above that for ship-ments, which pointed to modest near-term gains in busi-ness equipment spending despite relatively positive read-ings on business conditions from national and regional  structures edged down in November but remained higher than in the third quarter. Real federal government purchases appeared likely to have decreased sharply in the fourth quarter, reversing much of the surprisingly strong increase in the third quarter.  Real state and local government purchases were rising modestly in the fourth quarter, as nominal con-struction expenditures for October and November were little changed, on net, and the payrolls of these govern-ments increased somewhat.  The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed substan-tially in November, with imports declining more than exports.  The decrease in the value of imports stemmed in large part from a reduction in the value of petroleum imports, reflecting both lower prices and volumes.  However, many other categories of goods imports were also weaker.  Export declines were concentrated in cap-ital goods, particularly aircraft.  Despite the narrowing of the nominal trade deficit in November, real net exports appeared to be on track to decline in the fourth quarter after adding considerably to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the third quarter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1¼ percent over the 12 months ending in November, while core prices, as measured by PCE prices excluding food and energy, rose about 1½ percent; consumer energy prices declined, and con-sumer food prices increased faster than overall prices.  Over the 12 months ending in December, total inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) was       ¾ percent, while core CPI inflation was 1½ percent.  Over the 3 months ending in December, the total CPI decreased at an annual rate of 2½ percent, reflecting re-cent declines in consumer energy prices, and the core CPI increased at a 1 percent pace.  Measures of expected long-run inflation from a variety of surveys, including Dealers, remained stable.  In contrast, market-based measures of inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead declined further.  Over the 12 months ending in Decem-ber, nominal average hourly earnings for all employees increased only slightly faster than core consumer price inflation. Foreign real GDP growth appeared to increase slightly in the fourth quarter.  In the euro area, retail sales, car registrations, and industrial production through Novem-ber were above their third-quarter averages, and in Ja-pan, strengthening consumption and exports suggested a recovery of output after two quarters of contraction.  However, growth slowed in China, partly reflecting fur-ther moderation in residential investment, and declining construction activity also contributed to slowing GDP growth in Korea and the United Kingdom.  Inflation in the advanced foreign economies declined sharply at the end of last year, amid rapidly falling energy prices.  By contrast, inflation in the emerging market economies fell only modestly, as several of these economies have      government-administered energy prices and some have been experiencing upward price pressures from currency depreciations. Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Over the intermeeting period, amid trading that was vol-atile at times, longer-term sovereign yields in the United States and other advanced economies declined.  These moves were attributed in part to a deterioration in mar-ket sentiment associated with downward pressure on in-flation, increased concern about the global economic outlook, and announced and anticipated foreign central bank policies.  Moreover, continued sharp declines in oil prices and U.S. economic data releases that were viewed by investors as a bit weaker than anticipated, on balance, reportedly weighed on sentiment. Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period were apparently seen as about in line with expec-tations on balance.  However, reflecting in part the dete-rioration in market sentiment, the expected path for the federal funds rate implied by market quotes shifted mary Dealers indicated that dealers continued to put the highest probability on scenarios in which the FOMC chooses to commence policy firming around the middle of the year, although the average probability assigned to a commencement after June increased somewhat. Yields on nominal Treasury securities continued to move lower over the intermeeting period, with market expectations of the policy rate path being revised down-ward, and with term premiums declining, in part reflect-ing actual and expected policy easing abroad.  On bal-ance, the Treasury yield curve flattened over the inter-meeting period, while interest rate volatility increased somewhat.  Although the measure of inflation compen-sation over the next 5 years based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) increased, inflation compen-sation 5 to 10 years ahead declined further to its lowest level in a decade.  Yields on 5- and 10-year TIPS moved lower over the period. Over the intermeeting period, U.S. equity markets were volatile.  Option-implied volatility for the S&P 500 index declined, on balance, but remained in the upper half of  the range seen over the past year.  Broad U.S. equity price indexes moved higher, while stock prices for large domestic banking organizations moved lower on net.  Corporate bond spreads were also volatile over the in-termeeting period but were little changed, on net, for in-vestment-grade issuers and ended the period lower for speculative-grade issuers, particularly energy companies. Credit flows to nonfinancial firms generally remained strong through the last quarter of 2014, though they slowed somewhat for riskier firms.  Gross corporate bond issuance continued to be solid, although specula-tive-grade bond issuance declined late in the year and re-mained subdued into January.  Commercial and indus-bust rate in the fourth quarter of 2014, consistent with the stronger loan demand from large and middle-market firms reported in the January Senior Loan Officer Opin-ion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS).  Issu-ance of syndicated leveraged loans in the fourth quarter was at its slowest pace in two years, as spreads on newly issued loans increased and refinancing activity declined significantly.  Issuance of collateralized loan obligations declined but remained elevated; 2014 was the strongest year on record for the issuance of such securities.  Financing conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector stayed accommodative.  In the January SLOOS, banks reported that standards continued to ease, on net, for CRE lending and noted stronger de-mand for all CRE loan types.  Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities continued at a solid pace in November and December. Residential mortgage credit conditions, while remaining tight, showed some further signs of gradual easing.  Ac-cording to the January SLOOS, lending standards eased for a number of categories of residential mortgage loans in the fourth quarter.  The price of mortgage credit for qualified borrowers declined again over the intermeeting period, with interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mort-gages reaching levels close to their all-time lows.  Re-finance applications rose near the end of the intermeet-ing period. Conditions in consumer credit markets stayed largely ac-commodative over the intermeeting period.  Auto and student loan balances continued to post significant gains through November, while the expansion of credit card fourth quarter as a whole.  Respondents to the January SLOOS indicated that demand for auto and credit card loans had strengthened further in the fourth quarter.  Consumer credit quality has remained strong on balance.  The credit performance of auto loans, however, report-edly deteriorated a bit further for some lenders, and sev-eral banks indicated in the January SLOOS that they ex-pect the performance of subprime auto loans to worsen this year. The U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies of most other advanced economies amid investor concerns about growth in those economies as well as increased monetary accommodation in some of them; the dollar was largely unchanged, on average, against the currencies of emerging market economies.  Sovereign yields abroad moved lower, with euro-area yields reflecting the ex-pected and actual easing of the stance of monetary policy by the European Central Bank (ECB) and U.K. yields responding to a shift in expectations toward a later start of Bank of England policy firming.  Global equity mar-kets were broadly higher, rebounding from declines in mid-December. Several central banks announced monetary policy ac-tions during the period.  The ECB announced that it would expand its asset purchase program to include the purchase of sovereign bonds; the euro depreciated sig-nificantly against the dollar both in anticipation of and following this announcement.  The Swiss National Bank (SNB) ended its policy of defending the exchange rate floor of 1.20 Swiss francs per euro, resulting in a signifi-cant appreciation of the franc.  At the same time, the SNB reduced policy rates, moving the rate it pays on de-posits and its target range for Swiss franc LIBOR, or London interbank offered rate, further into negative ter-ritory.  The Bank of Canada, National Bank of Denmark, Reserve Bank of India, and Central Bank of Turkey also cut policy rates in January to support their economies and, in some cases, to foster higher inflation, while the Central Bank of Brazil raised rates in response to con-cerns about elevated inflation.  The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability.  Relatively high levels of capital and liquidity in the banking sector, moderate levels of ma-turity transformation in the financial sector, and a rela-tively subdued pace of borrowing by the nonfinancial sector continued to be seen as important factors limiting the vulnerability of the financial system to adverse shocks.  However, the staff report noted valuation pres-sures in some asset markets.  Such pressures were most notable in corporate debt markets, despite some easing in recent months.  In addition, valuation pressures ap-pear to be building in the CRE sector, as indicated by rising prices and the easing in lending standards on CRE  loans.  Finally, the increased role of bond and loan mu-tual funds, in conjunction with other factors, may have increased the risk that liquidity pressures could emerge in related markets if investor appetite for such assets wanes.  The effects on the largest banking firms of the sharp decline in oil prices and developments in foreign exchange markets appeared limited, although other in-stitutions with more concentrated exposures could face strains if oil prices remain at current levels for a pro-longed period.  Staff Economic Outlook The staff estimated that real GDP growth in the second half of 2014 was faster than in the projection prepared for the December meeting, primarily reflecting stronger-than-expected consumer spending.  Even so, real GDP was still estimated to have risen more slowly in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, as changes in both net exports and federal government purchases ap-peared likely to have subtracted from real GDP growth in the fourth quarter following large positive contribu-tions in the previous quarter.   half of 2015 was revised up since December, in part re-flecting an anticipated boost to consumer spending from declines in energy prices.  However, the forecast for real GDP growth over the medium term was little revised, as the greater momentum implied by recent spending gains and the support to household spending from lower en-ergy prices was about offset by the restraint implied by the recent appreciation of the dollar.  The staff contin-ued to forecast that real GDP would expand at a mod-estly faster pace in 2015 and 2016 than it did in 2014 and that it would rise more quickly than potential output, supported by increases in consumer and business confi-dence and a pickup in foreign economic growth, as well as by a U.S. monetary policy stance that was assumed to remain highly accommodative for some time.  In 2017, real GDP growth was projected to begin slowing to-ward, but to remain slightly above, the rate of growth of potential output.  The expansion in economic activity over the medium term was anticipated to lead to a slow reduction in resource slack, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to move slightly -run natural rate for a time.   r term was re-vised down, as further sharp declines in crude oil prices since the December FOMC meeting pointed toward a somewhat larger transitory decrease in the total PCE price index early this year than was previously projected.  In addition, the incoming data on consumer prices apart from those for energy showed a somewhat smaller rise 2016 and 2017 was essentially unchanged, with inflation objective.  Nevertheless, inflation was projected to reach 2 percent over time, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the Commit- and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to fade. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-tion as similar to the average over the past 20 years.  The risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, reflecting the ssessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand ad-verse shocks.  At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.  The downside risks to the forecast for infla-tion were seen as having increased somewhat, partly re-flecting the recent soft monthly readings on core infla-tion.   Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace.  Although growth likely slowed from the rapid rate re-corded for the third quarter of 2014, a variety of indica-tors suggested that real GDP continued to grow faster than potential GDP late in the year and during January.  Labor market conditions improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate; participants judged that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish.  Participants expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would increase at a moderate pace sufficient to lead to further improve-ments in labor market conditions toward levels con-ployment.  Inflation had declined further below the -run objective, largely reflecting de-clines in energy prices, and was anticipated to decline further in the near term.  Market-based measures of in-flation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead had registered a further decline, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.  Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually market improved further and the transitory effects of  lower energy prices and other factors dissipated.  The risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market were seen as nearly balanced.  Participants gen-erally regarded the net effect of the recent decline in en-ergy prices as likely to be positive for economic activity and employment.  Many participants continued to judge that a deterioration in the foreign economic situation could pose downside risks to the outlook for U.S. eco-nomic growth.  Several saw those risks as having dimin-ished over the intermeeting period, with lower oil prices and actions of foreign central banks both being support-ive of growth abroad, but others pointed to heightened geopolitical and other risks. With respect to the U.S. economy, participants noted that household spending was rising moderately.  Recent declines in oil prices, which had boosted household pur-chasing power, were among the factors likely to under-pin consumer spending in coming months; other factors cited as supporting household spending included low in-terest rates, easing credit standards, and continued gains in employment and income.  However, it was noted that the recovery in the housing sector remained slow and that tepid nominal wage growth, if continued, could be-come a significant restraining factor for household spending.  Industry contacts pointed to generally solid business conditions, with businesses in many parts of the country continuing to express optimism about prospects for fur-ther improvement in 2015.  Although manufacturing ac-tivity appeared to have slowed somewhat over the inter-meeting period in some regions, business contacts sug-gested that this slowing was likely to prove temporary, and information from some parts of the country sug-gested that capital investment was poised to pick up.  Several participants noted that there were signs of layoffs in the oil and gas industries, and that persistently low en-ergy prices might prompt a larger retrenchment of em-ployment in these industries.  In addition, it was ob-served that if capital investment in energy-producing in-dustries slowed significantly, it could damp the overall expansion of economic activity for a period, especially if the slowing took place after most of the positive effects of lower energy prices on growth in household spending had occurred.  A few participants observed that govern-ment spending was unlikely to be a major contributor to the expansion of demand in the period ahead, with real federal purchases projected to be fairly flat over the me-dium term. In their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, par-ticipants noted that a number of developments over the intermeeting period had likely reduced the risks to U.S. growth.  Accommodative policy actions announced by a number of foreign central banks had likely strengthened the outlook abroad.  The decline in energy prices was also seen as potentially exerting a stronger-than-antici-pated positive effect on growth in the domestic econ-omy and abroad.  However, the increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar was expected to be a persis-tent source of restraint on U.S. net exports, and a few participants pointed to the risk that the dollar could ap-preciate further.  In addition, the slowdown of growth in China was noted as a factor restraining economic expan-sion in a number of countries, and several continuing risks to the international economic outlook were cited, including global disinflationary pressure, tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine, and financial uncertainty in Greece.  Overall, the risks to the outlook for U.S. eco-nomic activity and the labor market were seen as nearly balanced. Participants noted that inflation had moved further be--run objective, largely re-flecting declines in energy prices and other transitory factors.  A number of participants observed that, with anchored inflation expectations, the fall in energy prices should not leave an enduring imprint on aggregate infla-tion.  It was pointed out that the recent intensification of downward pressure on inflation reflected price move-ments that were concentrated in a narrow range of items , a pattern borne out by trimmed mean measures of inflation.  Several partici-pants remarked that inflation measures that excluded en-ergy items had also moved down in recent months, but these declines partly reflected transitory factors, includ-ing downward pressure on import prices and the pass-through of lower energy costs to the prices of  non-      energy items.  Nonetheless, several participants saw the continuing weakness of core inflation measures as a con-cern.  In addition, a few participants suggested that the weakness of nominal wage growth indicated that core and headline inflation could take longer to return to         2 percent than the Committee anticipated.  In contrast, a couple of participants suggested that nominal wage growth provides little information about the future be-havior of price inflation.  Participants also discussed the possibility that, because of the infrequent occurrence of reductions in nominal wages, wages may not have fully adjusted downward in the period of high unemploy-ment, and therefore pent-up wage deflation might have weighed on wage gains for a time during the expansion.  If this was the case, nominal wage growth could be ex-pected to pick up in coming periods and to resume a  more normal relationship with labor market slack.  Most participants expected that continuing reductions in re-source slack would be helpful in returning inflation over -run objective, but a few participants voiced concern that nominal wage growth might rise rapidly and inflation might exceed 2 percent for a time. Participants discussed the sizable decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation that had been observed over the past year and continued over the in-termeeting period.  A number of them judged that the decline mostly reflected a reduction in the risk premiums embedded in nominal interest rates rather than a decline in inflation expectations; this interpretation was sup-ported by results of some analytical models used to de-compose movements in market-based measures of infla-tion compensation and also by the continuing stability of survey-based measures of inflation expectations.  However, other participants put some weight on the possibility that the decline in inflation compensation re-flected a reduction in expected inflation.  These partici-pants further argued that the stability of survey-based measures of inflation expectations should not be taken as providing much reassurance; in particular, it was noted that in Japan in the late 1990s and early 2000s, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-tions had not recorded major declines even as a disinfla-tionary process had become entrenched.  In addition, a few participants argued that even if the shift down in in-flation compensation reflected lower inflation risk pre-miums rather than reductions in expected inflation, pol-icymakers might still want to take that decline into ac-count because it could reflect increased concern on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity.  Participants generally agreed that the behavior of       market-based measures of inflation compensation needed to be monitored closely. Participants also discussed other aspects of the substan-tial decline in nominal longer-term interest rates and its implications. The fall had occurred despite the strength-ening U.S. economic outlook and market expectations that policy normalization could begin later this year.  Some participants suggested that shifts of funds from abroad into U.S. Treasury securities may have put down-ward pressure on term premiums; the shifts, in turn, may have reflected in part a reaction to declines in foreign sovereign yields in response to actual and anticipated monetary policy actions abroad.  A couple of partici-pants noted that the reduction in longer-term real inter-est rates tended to make U.S. financial conditions more accommodative, potentially calling for a somewhat higher path for the federal funds rate going forward.  Others observed that insofar as the shifts reflected con-cerns about growth prospects abroad or were accompa-nied by a stronger dollar, the implications for U.S. mon-etary policy were less clear.  It was further noted that investment flows from abroad could also be contrib-uting to the decline in TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation, as such flows tend to be concentrated in nominal Treasury securities rather than inflation-        protected securities. Participants saw broad-based improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period, includ-ing strong gains in payroll employment and a further re-duction in the unemployment rate.  Some participants believed that considerable labor market slack remained, especially when indicators other than the unemployment rate were taken into account, including the unusually large fraction of the labor force working part time for economic reasons.  A few observed that the combina-tion of recent labor market improvements and contin-ued softness in inflation had led them to lower their es-timates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  However, a few others saw only a limited degree of re-maining labor underutilization or anticipated that un-derutilization would be eliminated relatively soon.   Discussion of Policy Planning Participants discussed considerations related to the choice of the appropriate timing of the initial firming in monetary policy and pace of subsequent rate increases.  Ahead of this discussion, the staff gave a presentation that outlined some of the key issues likely to be involved, including the extent to which similar economic out-comes could be generated by different combinations of the date of the initial firming of policy and the pace of rate increases thereafter, how these combinations could affect the risks to economic outcomes, a review of past episodes in the United States and abroad in which mon-etary policy transitioned to a tightening phase after a lengthy period of low policy rates, and issues related to communications regarding the likely timing and pace of normalization. Participants discussed the tradeoffs between the risks that would be associated with departing from the effec-tive lower bound later and those that would be associ-ated with departing earlier.  Several participants noted that a late departure could result in the stance of mone-tary policy becoming excessively accommodative, lead-ing to undesirably high inflation.  It was also suggested that maintaining the federal funds rate at its effective  lower bound for an extended period or raising it rapidly, if that proved necessary, could adversely affect financial stability.  Some participants were concerned that a deci-sion to delay the commencement of tightening could be perceived as indicating that an overly accommodative policy is likely to prevail during the firming phase.  In connection with the risks associated with an early start to policy normalization, many participants observed that a premature increase in rates might damp the apparent solid recovery in real activity and labor market condi-tionsobjectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-flation.  In addition, an earlier tightening would increase the likelihood that the Committee might be forced by adverse economic outcomes to return the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound.  Some participants noted the communications challenges associated with the prospect of commencing policy tightening at a time when inflation could be running well below 2 percent, and a few expressed concern that in some circumstances the public could come to question the credibility of the   Indeed, one participant rec-ommended that, in light of the outlook for inflation, the Committee consider ways to use its tools to provide more, not less, accommodation. Many participants indicated that their assessment of the balance of risks associated with the timing of the begin-ning of policy normalization had inclined them toward keeping the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound for a longer time.  Some observed that, even with these risks taken into consideration, the federal funds rate may have already been kept at its lower bound for a sufficient length of time, and that it might be appropriate to begin policy firming in the near term.  Regardless of the particular strategy undertaken, it was noted that, pro-vided that the data-dependent nature of the path for the federal funds rate after its initial increase could be com-municated to financial markets and the general public in an effective manner, the precise date at which firming commenced would have a less important bearing on eco-nomic outcomes. Participants discussed the economic conditions that they anticipate will prevail at the time they expect it will be appropriate to begin normalizing policy.  There was wide agreement that it would be difficult to specify in advance an exhaustive list of economic indicators and the values that these indicators would need to take.  Nonetheless, a number of participants suggested that they would need to see further improvement in labor market conditions and data pointing to continued growth in real activity at a pace sufficient to support additional labor market gains before beginning policy normalization.  Many partici-pants indicated that such economic conditions would help bolster their confidence in the likelihood of infla- after the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.  Some participants noted that their confidence in inflation returning to 2 percent would also be bolstered by stable or rising levels of core PCE inflation, or of alternative series, such as trimmed mean or median measures of inflation.  A number of participants emphasized that they would need to see ei-ther an increase in market-based measures of inflation compensation or evidence that continued low readings on these measures did not constitute grounds for con-cern.  Several participants indicated that signs of im-provements in labor compensation would be an im-portant signal, while a few others deemphasized the value of labor compensation data for judging incipient inflation pressures in light of the loose short-run empir-ical connection between wage and price inflation. Participants discussed the communications challenges associated with signaling, when it becomes appropriate to do so, that policy normalization is likely to begin rel-atively soon while remaining clear that the actions would depend on incoming data.  Many partici-statement, whenever that might occur, as risking a shift in market expectations for the beginning of policy firm-ing toward an unduly narrow range of dates.  As a result, some expressed the concern that financial markets might overreact, resulting in undesirably tight financial condi-tions.  Participants discussed some possible communica-tions by which they might further underscore the data dependency of their decision regarding when to tighten the stance of monetary policy.  A number of participants noted that while forward guidance had been a very useful tool under the extraordinary conditions of recent years, as the start of normalization approaches, there would be limits to the specificity that the Committee could pro-vide about its timing.  Looking ahead, some participants highlighted the potential benefits of streamlining the t once normalization has begun.  More broadly, it was suggested that the Committee should communicate clearly that policy deci-sions will be data dependent, and that unanticipated eco-nomic developments could therefore warrant a path of the federal funds rate different from that currently ex-pected by investors or policymakers. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since  the FOMC met in December indicated that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace.  Labor mar-ket conditions had improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate; numerous labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish.  Household spending was rising moderately; recent declines in en-ergy prices had boosted household purchasing power.  Business fixed investment was advancing, while the re-covery in the housing sector remained slow.  Inflation -run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices, and was expected to decline further in the near term.        Market-based measures of five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation had declined substantially in re-cent months, but survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable.  The Com-mittee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee also expected that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory ef-fects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.  In view of the uncertainties about the inflation outlook, the Committee agreed that it should continue to monitor inflation developments closely. In their discussion of language for the postmeeting state-ment, members generally agreed that they should acknowledge the solid growth over the second half of 2014 as well as the further improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period.  Job gains had been strong, and the Committee judged that labor mar-ket slack continued to diminish.  In addition, members decided that the statement should note the further de-cline of inflation seen of late and the additional decline that was in prospect in the near term, while also register-ing their judgment that these short-term movements of inflation largely reflected the recent decline in energy prices and other transitory factors, and that inflation was likely to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term.  Members also agreed that it was appropriate to observe that lower energy prices had boosted household purchasing power.  The Committee further decided that the postmeeting statement should explicitly acknowledge the role of international developments as one of the factors influencing assess-ment of progress toward its objectives of maximum em-ployment and 2 percent inflation.   The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to reaffirm cision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its as-sessment of actual and expected progress toward its ob-jectives of maximum employment and 2 percent infla-tion.  Members agreed to continue to include, in the for-ward guidance, language indicating that the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.  Members agreed that their policy decisions would remain data dependent, and they continued to include wording in the statement    noting that if incoming information indicates faster pro-mployment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then in-creases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely occur sooner than currently anticipated, and, conversely, that if progress proves slower than ex-pected, then increases in the target range would likely occur later than currently anticipated.  The Committee decided to maintain its policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securi-holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial condi-tions.  Finally, the Committee also decided to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: nsistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to       ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury  securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the -backed securities transactions.  The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing nce sheet that could affect the attainment over    The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: Market Committee met in December suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.  Labor market conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate.  On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish.  Household spending is rising moderately; recent declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power.  Business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow.  Inflation has declined further below the -run objective, largely re-flecting declines in energy prices.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined substantially in recent months; survey-based measures of longer-term infla-tion expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employ-ment and price stability.  The Committee ex-pects that, with appropriate policy accommo-dation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Com-mittee judges consistent with its dual man-date.  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation is anticipated to decline further in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the me-dium term as the labor market improves fur-ther and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.  The Com-mittee continues to monitor inflation devel-opments closely. To support continued progress toward maxi-mum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In de-termining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progressboth realized and expectedtoward its objec-tives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-count a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indica-tors of inflation pressures and inflation expec-tations, and readings on financial and interna-tional developments.  Based on its current as-sessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.  However, if incoming in-formation indicates faster progress toward the tives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than cur-rently anticipated.  Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated. The Committee is maintaining its existing pol-icy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treas-ury securities at auction.  This policy, by keep--term securities at sizable levels, should help main-tain accommodative financial conditions. When the Committee decides to begin to re-move policy accommodation, it will take a bal-anced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation  of 2 percent.  The Committee currently antic-ipates that, even after employment and infla-tion are near mandate-consistent levels, eco-nomic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the  Voting for this action: Janet L.
