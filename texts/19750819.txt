By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period July 15 through August 18, 1975, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. 8/19/75By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that output of goods and services bottomed out in the second quarter and is likely to increase appreciably in the current quarter. In July retail sales expanded further and industrial production rose moderately for the second consecutive month, following 8 months of decline. Conditions in labor markets improved further: employment increased, the unemployment rate declined from 8.6 to 8.4 per cent, and the average workweek in manufacturing lengthened considerably. Average wholesale prices rose sharply in July, chiefly because of increases in prices of agricultural and energy products.  The advance in average wage rates has continued to moderate over recent months.  In recent weeks the average exchange value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has risen considerably further, reflecting additional increases in interest rates on U.S. dollar assets relative to rates on foreign currency assets. In June the U.S.  foreign trade surplus rose substantially, as exports increased sharply while imports declined slightly further.  In July M1 increased relatively little and growth in M2 and M3 slowed substantially, following a sharp increase in depositors' balances in May and June in connection with Federal income tax rebates and supplementary social security payments. Market interest rates in general have risen appreciably further in recent weeks, in association with indications of strengthening economic activity, more rapid inflation, and large current and prospective Treasury financing requirements.  Corporate bond offerings moderated somewhat in July but State and local government offerings continued large.  Financial markets reflected considerable uncertainty stemming from New York City financing problems. Business demands for short-term credit remained weak, although less so than in earlier months. 8/19/75In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to stimulating economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on September 16, 1975.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
