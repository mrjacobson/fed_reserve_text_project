With Mr. Coldwell dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services increased at a faster rate in the second quarter than in the two preceding quarters. In June the unemployment rate declined, but it was still substantial. Wholesale prices of farm and food products advanced appreciably further in June and the rise in prices of industrial commodities remained substantial. Recent data suggest moderation in the pace of advance in wage rates. In foreign exchange markets, following disturbances leading to a floating of the pound sterling, the dollar has come under pressure and the reserves of European central banks have increased sharply.  In May, the excess of merchandise imports over exports remained large, though a little less than in April.  Growth in the narrowly defined money stock was relatively slow in May and June, but preliminary weekly data suggest a pickup in early July. Growth in the broadly defined money stock was more substantial as inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to banks remained strong. Expansion in the bank credit proxy slowed sharply in June as U.S. Government deposits declined markedly. In recent weeks, long-term interest rates have changed little; rates in shortterm markets have advanced, except for those on shorter-maturity Treasury bills. 7/18/72 -5In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing, developments in capital markets, and international developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  Messrs. Kiley and Ring entered the meeting.  By unanimous vote, the procedures for allocation of securities in the System Open Market Account were revised to read as follows: 1. Securities in the System Open Market Account shall be reallocated on the last business day of each month by means of adjustments proportionate to the adjustments that would have been required to equalize approximately the average ratios of gold holdings to note liabilities of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks based on the ratios of gold to notes for the most recent five business days.  2. Until the next reallocation the Account shall be apportioned on the basis of the ratios determined in paragraph 1, except that temporary interim adjustments may be made in the apportionments for two or more Banks when desirable in the judgment of the Director of the Board's Division of Federal Reserve Bank Operations and the Manager of the System Open Market Account.  3. Profits and losses on the sale of securities from the Account shall be allocated on the day of delivery of the securities sold on the basis of each Bank's current holdings at the opening of business on that day. 7/18/72 -6It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, August 15, 1972, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.
