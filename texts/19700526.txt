By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that real economic activity declined more than previously estimated in the first quarter of 1970, but little further change is projected in the second quarter. Prices and costs generally are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, although some components of major price indexes recently have shown moderating tendencies. Since early May most long-term interest rates have remained under upward pressure, partly as a result of continued heavy demands for funds and possible shifts in liquidity preferences, and prices of common stocks have declined further. Attitudes in financial markets generally are being affected by the widespread uncertainties arising from recent international and domestic events, including doubts about the success of the Government's anti-inflationary program. Both bank credit and the money supply rose substantially from March to April on average; in May bank credit appears to be changing little while the money supply appears to be expanding rapidly. The overall balance of payments continued in considerable deficit in April and early May. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, while encouraging the resumption of sustainable economic 5/26/70growth and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, in view of current market uncertainties and liquidity strains, open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to moderating pressures on financial markets, while, to the extent compatible therewith, maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with the Committee's longer run objectives of moderate growth in money and bank credit.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, June 23, 1970, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
