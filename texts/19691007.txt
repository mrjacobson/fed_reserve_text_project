By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period September 9 through October 6, 1969, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  With Mr. Maisel dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: 10/7/69The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the pace of expansion in real economic activity was sustained in the third quarter by an acceleration of inventory investment, which about offset a further slackening in growth of private final sales. Some monthly economic measures have weakened recently, and slower over-all growth is projected for the fourth quarter Substantial upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Most market interest rates recently have risen to new highs as demands for funds have pressed against limited supplies. In September, on average, the money supply changed little as U.S. Government deposits rose considerably further, and bank credit increased slightly after 2 months of substantial decline. The outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's decreased further in September, and flows of consumer-type time and savings funds at banks and nonbank thrift institutions appear to have remained relatively weak. The U.S. foreign trade surplus increased a little in August. In August and September the deficit in the over-all balance of payments on the liquidity basis was very large, although not as large as in preceding months; and the official settlements balance, which had been in surplus for more than a year, shifted into deficit, reflecting slackened Euro-dollar borrowing by U.S. banks and new speculative flows into Germany. Exchange market tensions were reduced somewhat when the German Government decided to cease temporarily official sales of marks, after which the exchange rate for that currency rose above the official parity. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging sustainable economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.  By unanimous vote, the continuing authority directive was amended by the addition of the following paragraph 3: 10/7/69In order to insure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Banks to lend U.S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as the Committee may specify from time to time.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, October 28, 1969, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary
