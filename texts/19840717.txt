Secretary's Note: The following actions were taken at the Tuesday session.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period May 22 through July 16, 1984, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period May 22 through July 16, 1984, were ratified.  1/ Attended Monday session only.  2/ Attended portion of meeting on Monday and Tuesday related to consideration of the Committee's longer-run objectives for monetary and credit aggregates. 7/16-17/84By unanimous vote, the following longer-run policy for 1984 was reaffirmed by the Committee: The Committee agreed at this meeting to reaffirm the ranges for monetary growth that it had established in January: 4 to 8 percent for M1 and 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was also reaffirmed at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1984. It was anticipated that M3 and nonfinancial debt might increase at rates somewhat above the upper limits of their 1984 ranges, given developments in the first half of the year, but the Committee felt that higher target ranges would provide inappropriate benchmarks for evaluating longer-term trends in M3 and credit growth.  By unanimous vote, the following longer-run policy for 1985 was adopted by the Committee: For 1985 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 8-1/2 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  With Mr. Martin dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with thefollowing domestic policy directive: 7/16-17/84The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is continuing at a strong pace, but there are indications of moderation in some sectors. In May and June, industrial production and retail sales expanded further, though at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in both months and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 7.1 percent in June. Housing starts declined in May to a rate appreciably below the average in the first four months of 1984. Information on outlays and spending plans continues to suggest strength in business fixed investment. Since the beginning of the year, average prices and the index of average hourly earnings have risen more slowly than in 1983.  M1 grew rapidly in May and June after having changed little in April, while M2 continued to expand moderately.  M3 growth slowed somewhat in June but was relatively strong over the second quarter. From the fourth quarter of 1983 through June, M1 grew at a rate somewhat below the upper limit of the Committee's range for 1984; M2 increased at a rate a little below the midpoint of its longer-run range, while M3 expanded at a rate above the upper limit of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to grow in the second quarter at a pace above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, reflecting very large government borrowing along with strong private credit growth. Interest rates have fluctuated considerably since the May meeting of the Committee. Financial markets were affected by concerns arising from international debt problems. On balance, rates on private short-term securities rose further, while rates on Treasury bills were about unchanged; in long-term debt markets, rates on most private obligations changed little while those on Treasury bonds declined.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has risen considerably further since mid-May to a level above its peak in early January. The merchandise trade deficit rose further in April-May compared with the first quarter; an increase in oil and non-oil imports exceeded a slight rise in exports.-4- 7/16-17/84The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at this meeting to reaffirm the ranges for monetary growth that it had established in January: 4 to 8 percent for M1 and 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was also reaffirmed at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1984. It was anticipated that M3 and nonfinancial debt might increase at rates somewhat above the upper limits of their 1984 ranges, given developments in the first half of the year, but the Committee felt that higher target ranges would provide inappropriate benchmarks for evaluating longer-term trends in M3 and credit growth. For 1985 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 8-1/2 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain existing pressures on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of around 5-1/2, 7-1/2, and 9 percent respectively during the period from June to September. Somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates, while somewhat lesser restraint might be acceptable if growth of the monetary aggregates slowed significantly. In either case, such a change would be considered only in the context of appraisals of the continuing strength of the business expansion, inflationary pressures, financial market-5- 7/16-17/84conditions, and the rate of credit growth. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 8 to 12 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, August 21, 1984.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
