Secretary's note: Advice was subsequently received that the selections indicated above were satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 4-5, 1980, were approved.-4 - 3/18/80By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 4 through March 17, 1980, were ratified.  Pursuant to paragraph 3 of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Committee, by unanimous vote, expressly authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to enter into contracts to purchase foreign exchange at specified rates that reflected market rates of late February and early March and to transfer the foreign exchange so acquired directly to the Exchange Stabilization Fund at those same rates.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period February 4 through March 17, 1980, were ratified.  With Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services continued to grow in the first quarter of 1980 and that the rise in prices accelerated. In February retail sales declined moderately, but the decrease followed an exceptionally large increase in January. Industrial production expanded somewhat in both months, after a period of little change, and nonfarm payroll employment continued to rise. The unemployment-5 - 3/18/80rate edged down in February to 6.0 percent.  Private housing starts declined further in January and were more than one-fifth below the rate in the third quarter of last year.  The rise in producer prices of finished goods and in consumer prices was more rapid in the first month or two of 1980 than in 1979, despite some easing in prices of foods. Over the first two months of 1980 the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat below the rapid pace recorded in 1979.  The dollar has been in strong demand in exchange markets since mid-February, largely in response to rising U. S. interest rates; by early March the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies had returned to about the level reached at the end of last October, and since then, it has risen further. Intervention by foreign monetary authorities to support their currencies was very heavy in February and the first half of March. The U. S. foreign trade deficit rose sharply in January,although the volume and value of imports of petroleum were somewhat reduced.  Growth of M-1A and M-1B, which had remained moderate in January, accelerated sharply in February, and growth of M-2 also quickened. In recent weeks, however, monetary growth has subsided. Expansion of commercial bank credit picked up in the first two months of this year from the reduced pace in the fourth quarter of 1979. Market interest rates have risen substantially in recent weeks. An increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 12 to 13 percent was announced early on February 15, effectively immediately.  On March 14 the President announced a broad program of fiscal, energy, credit, and other measures designed to moderate and reduce inflationary forces in a manner that can also lay the groundwork for a return to stable economic growth. Consistent with that objective and with the continuing intent of the Federal Reserve System to restrain growth in money and credit during 1980, the Board-6 - 3/18/80of Governors took the following actions to reinforce the effectiveness of the measures announced in October 1979: 1. A special credit restraint program; 2. A special deposit requirement for all lenders on increases in certain types of consumer credit; 3. An increase in the marginal reserve requirement on managed liabilities of large member banks; 4. A special deposit requirement on increases in managed liabilities of large nonmember banks; 5. A special deposit requirement on increases in total assets of money market mutual funds; 6. A surcharge of 3 percentage points on frequent borrowings of large member banks from Federal Reserve Banks.  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on February 4-5, 1980, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3-1/2 to 6, 4 to 6-1/2, 6 to 9, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth over the first half of 1980 at an annual rate of 4-1/2 percent for M-1A and 5 percent for M-1B, or somewhat less, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 13 to 20 percent.  The Committee believes that, consistent with this short-run policy, M-2 should grow at an annual rate of about 7-3/4 percent over the first half and expansion of bank credit should slow in the months ahead to a pace compatible with growth over the year as a whole within the range agreed upon.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.-7 - 3/18/80Consideration was then given to the continuing authorizations of the Committee, in accordance with the customary practice of reviewing such matters at the first regular meeting in March of every year.  Secretary's note: On March 5, 1980, certain continuing authorizations of the Committee listed below, had been distributed by the Secretary with the advice that, in accordance with procedures approved by the Committee, they were being called to the Committee's attention before the March organization meeting to give members an opportunity to raise any questions they had concerning them.  Members were asked to so indicate if they wished to have any of the authorizations in question placed on the agenda for consideration at this meeting, and no such requests were received.  The authorizations in question were as follows: 1. Procedures for allocation of securities in the System Open Market Account.  2. List of Treasury Department officials to whom weekly reports on open market operations may be sent.  3. Authority for the Chairman to appoint a Federal Reserve Bank as agent to operate the System Account in case the New York Bank is unable to function.  4. Resolutions providing for continued operation of the Committee and for certain actions by the Reserve Banks during an emergency.  5. Resolution relating to examinations of the System Open Market Account.  6. Guidelines for the conduct of System operations in Federal agency issues.  7. Regulation relating to Open Market Operations of Federal Reserve Banks.  8. Rules of Organization, Rules Regarding Availability of Information, and Rules of Procedure.-8 - 3/18/80By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations shown below was reaffirmed: AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS 1.

The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or, under special circumstances, such as when the New York Reserve Bank is closed, any other Federal Reserve Bank) (a) to lend to the Treasury such amounts of securities held in the System Open Market Account as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, under such conditions as the Committee may specify; and (b) to purchase directly from the Treasury for renewable periods not to exceed thirty days, when authorized by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to an affirmative vote of not less than five members, for its own account (with discretion, in cases where it seems desirable, to issue participations to one or more Federal Reserve Banks) such amounts of special short-term certificates of indebtedness as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, provided that the rate charged on such certificates shall be a rate 1/4 of 1 percent below the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of such purchases and provided that the total amount of such certificates held at any one time by the Federal Reserve Banks shall not exceed $2 billion.  3. In order to insure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Banks to lend U. S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to 3/18/80Government securities dealers and to banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as the Committee may specify from time to time.  4.

Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.  By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations shown below was reaffirmed with an amendment to paragraph 6 substituting the title "Manager for Foreign Operations" for "Manager" the first time the latter appeared.
