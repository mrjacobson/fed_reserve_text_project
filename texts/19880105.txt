The Committee agrees that the passing of time and the year-end should permit further progress toward restoring a normal approach to open market operations, although still sensitive conditions in financial markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may continue to call for some flexibility in operations. Taking account of conditions in financial markets, somewhat lesser reserve restraint or somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from November through March at annual rates of about 5 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Over the same period, growth in M1 is expected to remain relatively limited. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent.  The meeting adjourned.Secretary
