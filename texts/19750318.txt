With Messrs. Bucher, Eastburn, and Sheehan dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is continuing to fall sharply in the current quarter. In February industrial production and employment declined substantially further.  The unemployment rate was unchanged, at 8.2 per cent, as the civilian labor force declined sharply. Average wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose moderately again in February, and prices of farm and food products declined 3/18/75sharply further. The advance in average wage rates, although large, remained well below the increases of last spring and summer.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar declined in February, but it strengthened somewhat in early March, as short-term interest rates abroad fell further and as market attitudes toward the dollar improved somewhat. In January the U.S. foreign trade deficit was only moderately above the rate in the fourth quarter of 1974 despite a large bulge in recorded imports of oil. Net outflows of capital reported by banks continued large as foreigners withdrew deposits.  The narrowly defined money stock, which had declined sharply in January, expanded considerably in February, and broader measures of the money stock grew at substantial rates. Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits were particularly large. Large-denomination CD's outstanding contracted in February and total bank credit showed little net change. Business demands for short-term credit remained weak, both at banks and in the commercial paper market, while demands in the longterm market continued exceptionally strong. Since midFebruary short-term market interest rates have declined a little while longer-term yields have risen. Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced from 6-3/4 to 6-1/4 per cent in early March.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to stimulating economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and working toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than has occurred in recent months. 3/18/75With Mr. Coldwell dissenting, the Committee voted to amend subsection 271.5(a) of the Rules Regarding Availability of Information as indicated below, effective March 24, 1975: SECTION 271.5 -DEFERMENT OF AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN INFORMATION (a) Deferred availability of information. -In some instances, certain types of information of the Committee are not published in the Federal Register or made available for public inspection or copying until after such period of time as the Committee may determine to be reasonably necessary to avoid the effects described in paragraph (b) of this section or as may otherwise be necessary to prevent impairment of the effective discharge of the Committee's statutory responsibilities. For example, the Committee's domestic policy directive adopted at each meeting of the Committee is published in the Federal Register approximately 45 days after the date of its adoption; and no information in the records of the Committee relating to the adoption of any such directive is made available for public inspection or coyping before it is published in the Federal Register or is otherwise released to the public by the Committee.  By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed its intention that the memoranda of discussion prepared for individual Committee meetings are not to be made available to the public until after the Committee has authorized their transfer to the National Archives. 3/18/75Consideration was then given to the continuing authorizations of the Committee, in accordance with the customary practice of reviewing such matters at the first meeting in March of every year.  Secretary's note: On February 28, 1975, certain continuing authorizations of the Committee, listed below, had been distributed by the Secretary with the advice that, in accordance with procedures approved by the Committee, they were being called to the Committee's attention before the March organization meeting to give members an opportunity to raise any questions they had concerning them. Members were asked to so indicate if they wished to have any of the authorizations in question placed on the agenda for consideration at this meeting, and no such requests were received.  The authorizations in question were as follows: 1. Procedures for allocation of securities in the System Open Market Account.  2. List of Treasury Department officials to whom weekly reports on open market operations may be sent.  3. Authority for the Chairman to appoint a Federal Reserve Bank as agent to operate the System Account in case the New York Bank is unable to function.  4. Resolutions providing for continued operation of the Committee and for certain actions by the Reserve Banks during an emergency.  5. Resolution relating to examinations of the System Open Market Account.  6. Regulation relating to Open Market Operations of Federal Reserve Banks.  7. Rules of Organization, Rules Regarding Availability of Information,1/ and Rules of Procedure.  By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed its intention that the memoranda of discussion prepared for individual Committee meetings are not to be made available to the public until after the Committee has authorized their transfer to the National Archives.  1/ As recorded above, an amendment to Section 271.5(a) of the Rules Regarding Availability of Information was made at this meeting. 3/18/75By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations shown below was reaffirmed: AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS 1.

In order to insure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Banks to lend U.S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as the Committee may specify from time to time.-10- 3/18/75By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations shown below was reaffirmed: AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS 1.

To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, and with the Bank for International Settlements: Austrian schillings Belgian francs Canadian dollars Danish kroner Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Japanese yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs B.

The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements ("swap" arrangements) for System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity: Amount of arrangement (millions of Foreign bank dollars equivalent) Austrian National Bank 250 National Bank of Belgium 1,000 Bank of Canada 2,000-12- 3/18/75Amount of arrangement (millions of Foreign bank dollars equivalent) National Bank of Denmark 250 Bank of England 3,000 Bank of France 2,000 German Federal Bank 2,000 Bank of Italy 3,000 Bank of Japan 2,000 Bank of Mexico 180 Netherlands Bank 500 Bank of Norway 250 Bank of Sweden 300 Swiss National Bank 1,400 Bank for International Settlements: Dollars against Swiss francs 600 Dollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs 1,250 3. Currencies to be used for liquidation of System swap commitments may be purchased from the foreign central bank drawn on, at the same exchange rate as that employed in the drawing to be liquidated. Apart from any such purchases at the rate of the drawing, all transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1(A) above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates and no attempt shall be made to establish rates that appear to be out of line with underlying market forces.  4. It shall be the practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions.  In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.-13- 3/18/755. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested insofar as practicable, considering needs for minimum working balances.  Such investments shall be in accordance with Section 14(e) of the Federal Reserve Act.  6. The Subcommittee named in Section 272.4(c) of the Committee's rules of procedure is authorized to act on behalf of the Committee when it is necessary to enable the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to engage in foreign currency operations before the Committee can be consulted. All actions taken by the Subcommittee under this paragraph shall be reported promptly to the Committee.  7. The Chairman (and in his absence the Vice Chairman of the Committee, and in the absence of both, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors) is authorized: A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the Secretary; B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary on such policy matters as may relate to the Secretary's responsibilities; and C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.  8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.  9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors' Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.-14- 3/18/75By unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive shown below was reaffirmed: FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE 1. The basic purposes of System operations in foreign currencies are: A. To help safeguard the value of the dollar in international exchange markets; B. To aid in making the system of international payments more efficient; C. To further monetary cooperation with central banks of other countries having convertible currencies, with the International Monetary Fund, and with other international payments institutions; D. To help insure that market movements in exchange rates, within the limits stated in the International Monetary Fund Agreement or established by central bank practices, reflect the interaction of underlying economic forces and thus serve as efficient guides to current financial decisions, private and public; and E. To facilitate growth in international liquidity in accordance with the needs of an expanding world economy.  2. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee, System operations in foreign currencies shall be undertaken only when necessary: A. To cushion or moderate fluctuations in the flows of international payments, if such fluctuations (1) are deemed to reflect transitional market unsettlement or other temporary forces and therefore are expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future; and (2) are deemed to be disequilibrating or otherwise to have potentially destabilizing effects on U.S. or foreign official reserves or on exchange markets, for example, by occasioning market anxieties, undesirable speculative activity, or excessive leads and lags in international payments;-15- 3/18/75B. To temper and smooth out abrupt changes in spot exchange rates, and to moderate forward premiums and discounts judged to be disequilibrating. Whenever supply or demand persists in influencing exchange rates in one direction, System transactions should be modified or curtailed unless upon review and reassessment of the situation the Committee directs otherwise; C. To aid in avoiding disorderly conditions in exchange markets. Special factors that might make for exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to short-run increases in international political tension, (2) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, and (3) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions. Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the Manager reaches a judgment that they may help to reestablish supply and demand balance at a level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments. In such cases, the Manager shall consult as soon as practicable with the Committee or, in an emergency, with the members of the Subcommittee designated for that purpose in paragraph 6 of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations; and D. To adjust System balances within the limits established in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations in light of probable future needs for currencies.  3. System drawings under the swap arrangements are appropriate when necessary to obtain foreign currencies for the purposes stated in paragraph 2 above.  4. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, transactions in forward exchange, either outright or in conjunction with spot transactions, may be undertaken only (i) to prevent forward premiums or discounts from giving rise to disequilibrating movements of short-term funds; (ii) to minimize speculative disturbances; (iii) to supplement existing market supplies of forward cover, directly or indirectly as a means of encouraging the retention or accumulation of dollar holdings by private foreign holders; (iv) to allow-16- 3/18/75greater flexibility in covering System or Treasury commitments, including commitments under swap arrangements, and to facilitate operations of the Stabilization Fund; (v) to facilitate the use of one currency for the settlement of System or Treasury commitments denominated in other currencies; and (vi) to provide cover for System holdings of foreign currencies.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Monday and Tuesday, April 14 and 15, 1975, beginning at 4:00 p.m. on Monday.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary-17-
