In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market     operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments     for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal     Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes     and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open     Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such foreign and     international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under     agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those     securities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those     available on such transactions in the market: and (b) for New York     Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to     the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in     paragraph l(c), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency     securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase     agreements between its own account and foreign and international     accounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such     accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a     service fee when appropriate.By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Currency     Operations was amended to reflect the new title of Manager for Foreign     Operations, System Open Market Account.AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS     Amended February 3, 19941. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the     Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to     the extent necessary to carry out the Committee\\'s foreign currency     directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant     thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the     Committee may issue from time to time:A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the       form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the       open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S.       Treasury, with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by       Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary       authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with       other international financial institutions:Austrian schillings       Belgian francs       Canadian dollars       Danish kroner       Pounds sterling       French francs       German marks       Italian lire       Japanese yen       Mexican pesos       Netherlands guilders       Norwegian kroner       Swedish kronor       Swiss francsB. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts       to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A       above.C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw       dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph       2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such       arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any       amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee,       because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies       not exceeding $25.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open       position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding       signs) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in       a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that       currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus       outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as       the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve     Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (\"swap\"     arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a     maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among     those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve     System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign     Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew   such arrangements on maturity:Foreign bankAmount of arrangement        (millions of dollars equivalent)Austrian National Bank\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0250National Bank of Belgium1,000Bank of Canada2,000 National Bank of Denmark\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0250Bank of England3,000Bank of France2,000German Federal Bank6,000Bank of Italy3,000Bank of Japan5,000Bank of Mexico\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0700Netherlands Bank\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0500Bank of Norway\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0250Bank of Sweden\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0300Swiss National Bank4,000Bank for International Settlements:Dollars against Swiss francs\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0600Dollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs 1,250\\xa0Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the     proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall     be referred for review and approval to the Committee.3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph     l.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the     Committee, be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of     providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign     currencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or     received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign     central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central     banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In     making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System     holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York     shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless     authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or     understandings concerning the administration of the accounts     maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign     banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of     Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the     Committee.5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested insofar as     practicable, considering needs for minimum working balances. Such     investments shall be in liquid form, and generally have no more than     12 months remaining to maturity. When appropriate in connection with     arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency     holdings. U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign     central banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities     within 30 calendar days.6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs     shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and     the Committee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the     Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the     Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman     may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on     the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as     alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee,     his alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the     request of any member, or at the request of the Manager for Foreign     Operations, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), for the purposes     of reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with     the Manager on other matters relating to his responsibilities. At the     request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such     reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the   Federal Open Market Committee.7. The Chairman is authorized:A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed       agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about       the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between       the System and the Treasury;B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning       System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary       on policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and       information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary       and Financial Policies.8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit     pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to     appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign     currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph     3.G(1) of the Board of Governors\\' Statement of Procedure with Respect     to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.By unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive shown below     was reaffirmed.FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE     Reaffirmed February 3, 19941. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be     directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that     market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior     consistent with the IMF Article IV, Section 1.2. To achieve this end the System shall:A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign       exchange.B. Maintain reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with       selected foreign central banks and with the Bank for International       Settlements.C. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other       countries and with international monetary institutions.3. Transactions may also be undertaken:A. To adjust System balances in light of probable future needs       for currencies.B. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments       in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange       Stabilization Fund.C. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the       Committee.4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted:A. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the       United States Treasury;B. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary       authorities; andC. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United       States in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange       arrangements under the IMF Article IV.By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions With Respect     to Foreign Currency Operations shown below were amended to reflect the     new title of Manager for Foreign Operations, System Open Market     Account.PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO     FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS     Amended February 3, 1994In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and     direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the     Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency     Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager     for Foreign Operations, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), shall     be guided by the following procedural understandings with respect to     consultations and clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency     Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee. All operations     undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to   the Committee.1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the     Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the     Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s       overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on       any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the       Committee.B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the       System\\'s net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150       million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with       repayment of swap drawings.C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of       trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change       in the System\\'s net position in that currency might be less than the       limits specified in l.B.D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the       larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap       arrangement.2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the     Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the     full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the     Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the     Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s       overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion       since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the       larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap       arrangement.3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the     Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any     operations that are not of a routine character.Agreement to \"Warehouse\" Foreign CurrenciesAt its meeting on February 2-3, 1993, the Committee had     reaffirmed the $5 billion limit on the amount of eligible foreign     currencies that the System was prepared to \"warehouse\" for the     Treasury and the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The purpose of     the warehousing facility is to supplement, at the discretion of the     Federal Reserve, the U.S. dollar resources of the Treasury and the ESF     for financing their purchases of foreign currencies and related     international operations. There had been no use of this facility     since a ESF repayment of $2 billion on April 2, 1992. The Committee     decided at this meeting to reaffirm the $5 billion ceiling which it     viewed as providing adequate operational flexibility to respond on   short notice to unanticipated developments.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan       McDonough, Broaddus, Forrestal, Kelley, LaWare,       Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.Vote against this action: Mr. Jordan.Absent and not voting: Messrs. Angell and       Mullins.Mr. Jordan dissented because he felt that providing funds to     the Treasury using a warehousing arrangement was, in effect, a loan to     the Treasury. In his opinion, direct financing of government     operations by the central bank is inappropriate and could compromise     the effective conduct of monetary policy. He did not rule out the     possible efficacy of some warehousing transactions in very exceptional     circumstances in the future, but he believed that the latter should be     approved only after full Committee discussion. Accordingly, he did     not want to retain the standing $5 billion authorization.By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the     meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 21,     1993, were approved.The Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments     in foreign exchange markets during the period since the December     meeting. There were no System open market transactions in foreign     currencies during this period, and thus no vote was required of the     Committee.The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments     in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions     in government securities and federal agency obligations during the     period December 21, 1993, through February 3, 1994. By unanimous     vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and     financial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in     1994, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting     period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information     available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee\\'s discussion     is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was     approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of     New York.The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that     economic activity recorded a strong advance during the closing months     of 1993, and the limited data available on production and employment     suggested appreciable further gains in the early weeks of this year.     Housing starts had strengthened substantially in the fourth quarter of     last year, and business fixed investment had registered a sharp rise.     Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices, excluding     their food and energy components, had been somewhat larger in recent     months than earlier in 1993, and prices of a number of commodities had     turned up.Assessment of the January labor market data was complicated     by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems, but a     variety of indicators pointed convincingly to a further strengthening     in the demand for labor. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted     a small gain in January after a sizable December increase.     Manufacturing employment rose for a fourth consecutive month, with     gains again concentrated in motor vehicles. Construction payrolls     edged down, evidently reflecting the adverse effects of severe winter     weather. The total number of jobs in the services industries was     unchanged in January, but the inclement weather apparently held down     employment in some segments of this sector as well. The average     workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers rose in January to     its highest level in almost five years; for manufacturing, the average     workweek remained at its post-World War II high for a third     consecutive month. The civilian unemployment rate, calculated on a     new basis, was 6.7 percent in January.Industrial production increased appreciably further in     December, and the available information suggested a considerable rise     in January. In December, the advance in manufacturing was led by the     motor vehicle and computing equipment industries. Sizable increases     in materials and construction supplies also were recorded. On the     other hand, the output of consumer goods other than motor vehicles was     sluggish, and the production of aircraft and defense and space     equipment continued to shrink. Total utilization of manufacturing     capacity rose again in December and reached a relatively high level,     judged against historical experience.Consumer spending, as measured by real personal consumption     expenditures, posted another solid increase in the fourth quarter, and     strong sales of motor vehicles in January suggested continued buoyancy     in consumer demand. In the fourth quarter, real outlays on motor     vehicles surged, and spending on other durable goods--notably     furniture, appliances and other household equipment--registered     further large gains. By contrast, real outlays for nondurable goods     and services rose only moderately. Housing starts jumped in December,     with both single-family and multifamily starts sharing in the advance.     For 1993 as a whole, housing starts were at their highest annual total     in four years. Sales of new homes were up sharply in November, and     sales of existing homes ended the year at the highest monthly level in     the twenty-five year history of the series.Real business fixed investment recorded a very large increase     in the fourth quarter. Business spending for equipment, notably for     information processing equipment, was up sharply for a seventh     straight quarter. The strength evident in recent orders for     nondefense capital goods pointed to further gains in shipments of     these goods in early 1994. Outlays for nonresidential structures in     the fourth quarter posted their largest quarterly rise in six years;     the increases were spread across a broad array of categories other     than office buildings. Construction permits continued to rise in the     fourth quarter, suggesting further growth of investment in     nonresidential structures in the near term.Business inventories remained generally well aligned with     sales through November, the most recent month for which complete data     were available. In manufacturing, inventory stocks fell in December     after edging lower in November: with brisk gains in shipments in both     months, the ratio of stocks to shipments fell further from levels that     already were low by historical standards. At the wholesale level,     inventories rose moderately in November after little change in the     preceding two months. The inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector     had changed little since May. Retail inventories expanded     substantially in November for a third straight month. The buildup of     stocks might have been in anticipation of robust holiday sales, but     for some retail businesses, particularly general merchandise stores,     the increases coincided with weak sales. For the retail sector as a     whole, the inventory-to-sales ratio was up slightly in November.The average nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit for the     October-November period was about the same as its average rate in the     third quarter. The value of exports was up for the two-month period,     with the increase occurring largely in machinery, automotive products,     and aircraft. The higher value of imports for the two-month period     reflected, as had been the case earlier in 1993, greater imports of     consumer goods, automotive products, and machinery. Trends in     economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared     to have diverged further in the fourth quarter. Moderate growth     appeared to be continuing in Canada and the United Kingdom, but     economic activity seemed to be growing more slowly or to have turned     down in Japan, western Germany, and France.Producer prices of finished goods were down slightly in     December after being unchanged in November. Excluding the food and     energy components, producer prices edged higher in December and were     up slightly for the year as a whole. At the retail level, consumer     prices rose modestly in November and December, with energy price     declines holding down the increase in the overall index. For items     other than food and energy, prices advanced in the two months at a     slightly faster pace than that seen over previous months of the year;     for 1993 as a whole, the increase was about the same as in 1992.     Hourly compensation of private industry workers increased in the     fourth quarter at the same pace as in the third quarter. For 1993,     the rise in hourly compensation was little changed from the previous     year. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers     rose sharply in January, but for the twelve months ended in January,     the increase was the same as that recorded for the previous twelve     months.At its meeting on December 21, 1993, the Committee adopted a     directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure     on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the     likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting     period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of     the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and     sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to     economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or     slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the     intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this     directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and     M3 over the following months.Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the     existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the     intermeeting period. Additional reserves were supplied to the banking     system on a temporary basis around year-end to meet seasonal movements     in currency and required reserves as well as an enlarged demand for     excess reserves. For the intermeeting period as a whole, the federal     funds rate remained close to 3 percent while adjustment plus seasonal     borrowing averaged somewhat more than anticipated.Most market interest rates declined slightly during the     intermeeting period, and major indexes of stock prices posted new     highs. Market participants saw the incoming news on inflation as     encouraging; still, they viewed the economy as relatively robust, and     on balance they deemed a firming of monetary policy to counteract a     potential buildup of inflation pressures as likely in the next few     months, but probably not in the very near term.In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the     dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies changed little on balance     over the intermeeting period. The dollar fell against the yen in the     context of somewhat higher Japanese interest rates and renewed     expressions of U.S. concern about bilateral trade issues. The dollar     appreciated slightly relative to the German mark and other European     currencies against the background of relatively strong U.S. economic     data and generally sluggish economic activity in continental Europe.Growth of the broad monetary aggregates, though a little     faster than in most of 1993, remained relatively slow over December     and January. Investors evidently continued to find low-yielding     deposits less appealing than stock and bond mutual funds, although     recent inflows to bond funds appeared to have been at a slower rate     than that seen over most of 1993. For the year 1993, growth of both     M2 and M3 was estimated to have been slightly above the lower ends of     the Committee\\'s ranges. Private borrowing had picked up in recent     months, and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a somewhat     faster, though still moderate, pace in the fourth quarter; for the     year, nonfinancial debt was estimated to have been in the lower half     of the Committee\\'s monitoring range.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that     economic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth     quarter, but that the economy still would advance in 1994 at a rate     somewhat in excess of the growth of potential. The severe winter     weather over much of the country and the California earthquake would     tend to distort economic indicators for the early part of the year:     however, taken together, these developments were not expected to have     a material or lasting effect on the overall level of activity or     prices. Consumer spending, which for some time had tended to outpace     the growth of disposable income, was projected to increase at a rate     more in line with incomes. Business fixed investment was expected to     decelerate gradually from the very rapid rate of 1993, reflecting the     diminishing effect of the earlier pickup in output growth, the slower     growth of corporate cash flow, and a less rapid decline in the cost of     capital. Homebuilding activity, driven by the greatly improved     affordability of housing and increased confidence in employment     prospects, was anticipated to continue at a relatively brisk pace     through much of the year. Exports were projected to strengthen     somewhat, bolstered by some pickup in foreign economic growth, and     fiscal restraint was expected to exert a reduced drag on spending. In     light of the limited margins of slack in labor and product markets     that were anticipated to prevail over the forecast horizon, the     ongoing expansion was projected to be associated with only a slight     further reduction in the core rate of inflation.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective     economic developments, members commented that the economy had entered     the new year with appreciable forward momentum and that the expansion     was likely to be sustained over the year ahead at a pace somewhat     above the economy\\'s long-run potential. The very rapid rate of     economic growth now indicated for the fourth quarter of 1993 clearly     could not be maintained. Much of the recent impetus to the expansion     stemmed from a surge in expenditures on housing, business equipment,     and consumer durables. Such spending had reached a very high level in     relation to underlying demands so that the pace of additional     increases undoubtedly would moderate during the course of 1994.     Still, the economic expansion seemed to have considerable momentum,     largely as a consequence of diminishing balance sheet constraints and     generally favorable financial conditions spurred by a highly     accommodative monetary policy. As a consequence, a number of members     expressed the view that the risks were on the upside of a moderate     growth forecast. In the context of low and decreasing slack in the     economy, little further progress would be made toward price stability     in 1994, and there was a distinct risk of higher inflation at some     point if monetary policy were not adjusted. While broad measures of     inflation did not on the whole suggest any changes in inflation     trends, some members noted that a number of commodity prices had     turned up in recent months, and they referred to still scattered but     increasing anecdotal reports that some business firms were paying     slightly higher prices for various materials purchased for use in the     production process.In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee     establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt     aggregates, the Committee members and the Federal Reserve Bank     presidents not currently serving as members had prepared projections     of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for     1994. The central tendency of the forecasts pointed to somewhat     faster economic growth this year than currently was estimated for     1993. The anticipated rate of economic expansion was expected to     foster a limited further drop in the rate of unemployment by the     fourth quarter of this year. With the slack in productive resources     expected to diminish further to a quite low level, price and cost     pressures were unlikely to abate significantly: indeed, price     increases in 1994 could exceed those of 1993 when inflation had been     held down by favorable developments in energy prices. Measured from     the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, the     forecasts for growth of real GDP had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4     percent and a full range of 2-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent. Projections of     the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1994 were     all in a range of 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent calculated on the basis of     the new survey recently introduced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.     For the CPI, the central tendency of the forecasts for the period from     the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994 was centered     on increases of about 3 percent within a range of 2-1/4 to 4 percent,     and for nominal GDP the forecasts were clustered in a range of 5-1/2     to 6 percent for the year.In the Committee\\'s review of factors underlying recent     developments, members observed that generally favorable financial     conditions provided a backdrop conducive to further robust expansion     in business activity. Much of the recent strengthening in economic     growth was generated by increased spending in interest-sensitive     sectors of the economy such as housing in response to relatively low     interest rates. Generally buoyant equity markets, a readier     availability of financing from lending institutions, and the     strengthened financial condition of businesses and households also     were cited as factors tending to boost economic activity. Balance     sheet restructuring activities appeared to have slackened markedly,     and while balance sheet adjustments probably were still being made,     the latter seemed to be exerting much less restraint on the     willingness of businesses and especially households to spend and to     incur new debt to finance growing expenditures.In their reports on developments across the nation, members     commented on widespread indications of improving economic activity,     including some strengthening in regions that earlier were     characterized by stagnant business conditions. Some areas continued     to be affected adversely by special factors, especially by spending     cutbacks in defense and aerospace industries. California was a     notable example, but a range of indicators suggested that the     California economy might be stabilizing, albeit at a depressed level.     after an extended period of declining activity. Mirroring these     developments, business sentiment was characterized as generally     optimistic around the nation. While business executives remained     cautious in their hiring practices, the expansion in business activity     was fostering sizable overall gains in employment even in areas where     some major business concerns were reducing their workforces. A few     large firms that previously had frozen or reduced their payrolls were     now reported to be hiring additional workers.Turning to prospective developments in key sectors of the     economy, the members anticipated that the expansion in consumer     expenditures would be well maintained during 1994, though the growth     in such spending probably would moderate to a pace more in line with     gains in disposable income. The available data on retail sales since     the holiday period were still limited, but anecdotal reports pointed     to continuing momentum in several parts of the country. Winter storms     had hindered sales in a number of areas, but according to some retail     contacts the adverse effects were likely to be temporary. In any     event, the very rapid rates of growth in sales of automobiles and     other consumer durables were not sustainable, and already high     consumer debt ratios would be a further inhibiting factor. It was     noted in this connection that consumer debt had become more     concentrated over the course of recent years among consumer groups     that were most likely to borrow to help finance their spending, with     the result that the ability of such consumers to incur additional     indebtedness could be diminished. Higher taxes confronting some     households also were cited as a negative factor in the outlook for the     consumer sector. On balance, however, while the prospects for     consumer spending clearly were not free of uncertainty, the marked     improvement in consumer confidence and favorable financial conditions     would provide a setting conducive to sustained moderate growth in     consumer expenditures.The improvement in consumer sentiment together with the     availability of relatively low cost financing had fostered very strong     growth in housing construction over the closing months of 1993 and,     adjusting for seasonal weather conditions, anecdotal reports from many     areas suggested a continued robust performance in this sector of the     economy in the early weeks of this year. The strength in housing     activity had induced increases in the costs of lumber and other     building materials, and shortages of skilled construction workers were     reported in some areas. Despite these developments, prices of new     homes did not appear at this point to be under significant upward     pressure. Looking ahead, with housing construction already at high     levels, further gains over the course of 1994 were expected to be     substantially below those recorded in recent quarters.Business fixed investment was likely to be sustained by     continuing efforts to modernize production facilities in order to     achieve more efficient operations in highly competitive domestic and     world markets. The gains in such investment had been concentrated in     expenditures for equipment, and while new orders pointed to further     brisk growth in the months ahead, increases in such expenditures were     likely to moderate over time. At the same time, growing economic     activity and associated declines in commercial and industrial vacancy     rates, at least in some parts of the country, suggested that nonresidential building construction other than office structures would post     sizable increases over the year. Rebuilding activity following the     earthquake in California would stimulate engineering and construction     in the Los Angeles area over the quarters ahead.Fiscal policy and foreign trade had exerted retarding effects     on the economy in 1993. While the response of the economy to fiscal     restraint and the outlook for export markets remained subject to     substantial uncertainty, both fiscal policy and the trade deficit were     expected at this point to be less negative factors in the performance     of the economy during 1994. With regard to the outlook for fiscal     policy, the downtrend in defense spending was projected to moderate     and to contribute to a smaller net decline in overall federal     government expenditures on goods and services in 1994. It was noted     that the widespread political support of efforts to curtail federal     government deficits could be expected to continue to contain new     federal spending initiatives. With regard to the outlook for U.S.     exports, more accommodative fiscal or monetary policies abroad were     expected to foster a gradual improvement in rates of economic growth     in major foreign industrial countries with beneficial effects on the     demand from those countries for U.S. goods and services. One member     also commented that NAFTA already seemed to be having a favorable     effect on some exports to Mexico.One sector of the economy that was viewed as a source of     particular uncertainty was the outlook for inventories. Business     firms continued to maintain tight control over their inventories, and     in general the latter were at quite low levels in relation to sales.     Indeed, there were some anecdotal reports that inventory shortfalls     had resulted in the loss of sales in recent months. Lean inventory     levels in the context of diminishing slack in labor and product     markets raised concerns about the potential for increasing capacity     pressures should strong demands persist that would tend to deplete     existing inventories and lead to efforts not only to rebuild but to     increase them. Thus far, there were few signs of developments such as     significant increases in delivery lead times or in the costs of goods     purchased by business firms that in the past had triggered substantial     inventory buildups. However, there were ample precedents in the     history of business cycle expansions of efforts to accumulate large     inventories in periods when strong final demands already were exerting     inflationary pressures in the economy.The members generally expressed concern about a buildup in     inflationary pressures during the year ahead, especially if what they     currently viewed as a very accommodative monetary policy were     maintained. A number of members emphasized that even with the     substantial slowing that they anticipated in the rate of economic     expansion from the very rapid growth in the fourth quarter, overall     margins of slack in labor and product markets, already reduced to     fairly modest levels, would shrink further in the quarters ahead with     the clear possibility that various imbalances and added inflation     would emerge in the absence of monetary tightening actions.     Continuing upward impetus to food prices, resulting from the adverse     weather conditions during 1993, and the likelihood that energy prices     would not decline further and might in fact turn up in an environment     of somewhat stronger worldwide demand for energy products could add to     overall price pressures.The members acknowledged that broad measures of prices and     wages had displayed mixed patterns over recent months and that on the     whole they did not yet point to any clear change in inflation trends.     However, some other indicators were more disquieting. One example was     the growing, though still limited, number of anecdotal reports of     shortages of skilled workers in some parts of the country or     occupations, notably construction. Moreover, there were more reports     of rising prices for products being purchased by business firms for     use in the production process and in turn of successful efforts by     businesses to raise their own prices in order to pass on higher costs     or to improve their profit margins. More generally, many commodity     prices had increased over the past several weeks. On the positive     side, competitive pressures remained intense in many markets,     augmented in markets for numerous products by competition from foreign     producers. Some members also commented that the tradeoff between     economic growth and inflation would be improved over the year ahead to     the extent that the credibility of the System\\'s anti-inflationary     policy was maintained.In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and     Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee     at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and     debt aggregates in 1994 that it had established on a tentative basis     at its meeting on July 6-7, 1993. The tentative ranges included     expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3,     measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of     1994. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial     debt had been set provisionally at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. All of     these ranges were unchanged from those that the Committee had set for     1993: the latter had been adjusted down to take account of ongoing     increases in velocity.In the Committee\\'s discussion of the ranges for 1994, which     tended to focus on M2, all the members expressed a preference for     affirming the M2 and M3 ranges that had been established on a provisional basis in July and all but one favored adopting the provisional     monitoring range for nonfinancial debt, that member preferred a lower     range. Many of the members commented on the uncertainties that     surrounded the establishment of ranges that were consistent with the     Committee\\'s goals for the economy. They noted that a variety of     developments had altered the historical relationships between the     monetary aggregates and broad measures of economic performance over     the past several years. The resulting uncertainty implied that the     Committee needed to retain a flexible approach to the behavior of the     monetary aggregates in relation to their ranges, including the need to     assess a broad array of other indicators to gauge the implications of     monetary growth developments. Nonetheless, the members concluded that     as best they could evaluate evolving financial conditions at this     point, monetary growth within the tentative ranges would be likely to     promote the Committee\\'s objectives of sustained economic expansion and     subdued inflation.In 1993, both M2 and M3 had grown at rates about 1/2 percentage point above the lower bounds of the ranges that the Committee now     contemplated retaining for 1994. According to a staff analysis     prepared for this meeting, somewhat faster growth in both of these     aggregates could be expected in 1994. But with nominal GDP also     expected to be stronger, as indicated by the central tendency of the     members\\' forecasts, the velocity of M2 would continue to rise at an     appreciably faster rate than historical relationships would have     suggested. This assessment assumed that households would continue to     redirect savings from M2-type accounts to higher-yielding investments,     especially bond and stock mutual funds. However, such redeployments     of funds should moderate this year to the extent that some investors     already had accomplished a considerable portion of their desired     portfolio reallocations and in light of the possibility that changes     in the prices of stocks and bonds, including the drop in bond prices     in recent months, would underline the risks of holding such     instruments. Moreover, depository institutions had strengthened their     capital positions markedly and were likely to compete more aggressively     for M2 and especially for M3-type deposits in an effort to maintain or     increase their role in the financing of expanding economic activity.     While these developments and their implications for monetary growth     could not be forecast with confidence, the members believed that the     ranges under consideration would probably be sufficiently wide to     accommodate M2 and M3 growth rates under a variety of likely velocity     scenarios. For example, if the factors that had tended to depress the     growth of the broad aggregates in relation to income did not abate as     expected this year, M2 and M3 growth would again be near the lower     bounds of the Committee\\'s ranges. Alternatively, if the behavior of     these aggregates were to move closer to earlier patterns, growth in     the upper portions of the ranges would foster an economic performance     in line with the members\\' forecasts.From the perspective of a longer time horizon, many of the     members noted that the provisional range for M2 was essentially at a     level that could well prove to be consistent with sustained and     noninflationary economic expansion. This conclusion assumed that     historical relationships between money growth and the expansion of     broad measures of economic performance would be restored at some     point. In the absence of such a development or the emergence of new,     reasonably stable relationships, the Committee would have to continue     to place diminished reliance on the monetary aggregates in the     formulation of monetary policy.With regard to the range for nonfinancial debt, the members     anticipated that its growth this year would remain within the contemplated range. A staff analysis suggested that its federal borrowing     component would decrease as a result of the ongoing effects of deficit     reduction measures that had been enacted and the rise in tax receipts     stemming from economic growth. At the same time, borrowing by the     nonfederal sectors should strengthen further against the backdrop of     more comfortable financial positions and the expected pickup in GDP     expansion. In one view, however, a somewhat lower range was desirable     for nonfinancial debt. In light of the shift in business preferences     away from debt and toward equity, debt velocity could increase and     slower growth in debt would be consistent with the Committee\\'s     objectives. However, this member could accept the higher range     favored by the other members for 1994.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all the     members indicated that they favored or could accept the ranges for     1994 that the Committee had established on a tentative basis at its     meeting in July 1993. In keeping with the Committee\\'s usual     procedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the ranges would be     reviewed at midyear, or sooner if deemed necessary, in light of the     behavior of the aggregates and interim economic and financial     developments. The Committee approved the following paragraph for     inclusion in the domestic policy directive:The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary       and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In       furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this       meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of       1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively,       measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth       quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that       developments contributing to unusual velocity increases       could persist during the year and that money growth       within these ranges would be consistent with its broad       policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of       total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8       percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary       aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light       of progress toward price level stability, movements in       their velocities, and developments in the economy and       financial markets.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan       McDonough, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley,       LaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.Votes against this action: None.Absent and not voting: Messrs. Angell and       Mullins.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting     period ahead, the members favored an adjustment toward a less     accommodative policy stance, though views differed to some extent with     regard to the amount of the adjustment. The current policy posture,     which had been in effect since the late summer of 1992, was highly     stimulative as evidenced, for example, by very low or even slightly     negative real short-term interest rates and, in the view of at least     some members, the relatively rapid growth over an extended period in     narrow measures of money and reserves. Such a policy had been     appropriate in a period when various developments had tended to     inhibit the expansion, including widespread efforts to repair strained     balance sheets and a variety of business restructuring activities that     had tended to depress confidence and spending. More recently, the     considerable progress made by households and businesses in decreasing     their debt service burdens and the much strengthened capital positions     of lending institutions had provided a financial basis, in the context     of low interest rates, for growth in demands on productive capacity     that could generate inflation pressures. In this situation, the     members agreed that monetary policy should be adjusted toward a more     neutral stance that would encourage sustained economic growth without     a buildup of inflationary imbalances. The members recognized that     timely action was needed to preclude the necessity for more vigorous     and disruptive policy moves later if inflationary pressures were     allowed to intensify. The history of past cyclical upswings had     demonstrated the inflationary consequences and adverse effects on     economic activity of delayed anti-inflation policy actions.In the course of the Committee\\'s discussion, a number of     members endorsed a policy move that would involve only a slight     adjustment toward a less accommodative degree of reserve pressure.     These members recognized that evolving economic conditions might well     justify a somewhat greater policy adjustment. They believed, however,     that even a slight move at this time was likely to have a particularly     strong impact on financial markets because it would be the first     policy change after a long hiatus and indeed the first tightening     action in about five years. The market effect might be amplified by a     contemplated decision to authorize the Chairman to announce the policy     action (discussed below). In the circumstances, these members felt     that a somewhat greater policy adjustment would incur an unacceptable     risk of dislocative repercussions in financial markets. A relatively     small move would readily accomplish the purposes of signaling the     Committee\\'s anti-inflation resolve and together with expected further     action should help to temper or avert an increase in inflation     expectations and speculative developments in financial markets.Other members indicated a preference for a somewhat greater     firming action that would move monetary policy closer to a desirable     neutral stance. In this view, recent developments in the economy had     demonstrated that monetary policy was much too accommodative and that     slow, gradual tightening moves risked allowing inflation pressures to     build. A more decisive policy move at this juncture would in fact     reduce uncertainty, because fewer discrete actions would be required     and they would have a more pronounced and desirable effect in curbing     inflationary sentiment and thus in minimizing upward pressures on     longer-term interest rates over time. The result would be a policy     stance that was more consistent with sustained economic expansion and     progress toward price stability.In further discussion, all the members indicated that they     could accept the proposed slight policy adjustment at this point, but     many observed that additional firming probably would be desirable     later. The members did not see any unusual likelihood that a further     policy action would be needed during the intermeeting period, and the     Committee therefore decided to retain an unbiased intermeeting     instruction in the directive. In this connection, it was understood     that the Committee would be prepared to review its policy stance and     take further action, if warranted by intermeeting developments, at a     telephone conference during the period ahead.At this meeting, Committee members discussed and agreed on a     proposal to have the Chairman announce the Committee\\'s short-term     policy decision promptly. The purpose of such an announcement, which     would be a departure from past Committee practice, was to avoid any     misinterpretation of the Committee\\'s action and its purpose. Because     this would be the first tightening policy action in a long time, it     was likely to attract considerable attention. The Committee did not     intend this announcement to set any precedents or to imply any     commitments regarding the announcement of its decisions in the future.     That matter would be reviewed along with other issues relating to the     disclosure of Committee information at a later meeting.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all the     members indicated that they could support a directive that called for     a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and     that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any     adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the     Committee decided that in the context of its long-run objectives for     price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful     consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments,     slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be     acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions     contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with     moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the first half of 1994.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of     New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by     the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in     accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting indicates       a strong advance in economic activity during the       closing months of 1993, and the limited data available       for the early weeks of this year suggest appreciable       further gains. The January labor market data were       complicated by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems; however, a variety of       indicators pointed convincingly to a continuing       expansion of employment. Industrial production       increased sharply in the fourth quarter and appears to       have risen considerably further in January. Consumer       spending and housing activity posted solid gains in       late 1993, and strong sales of motor vehicles in       January suggested continued buoyancy in consumer       demand. Trends in contracts and orders point to       further sizable gains in business fixed investment.       The average nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in       October-November was about the same as its average rate       in the third quarter. Over the latter part of 1993,       increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer       prices, excluding their food and energy components, were somewhat larger than earlier in the year and       prices of a number of commodities also turned up       recently.Most market interest rates have declined slightly       since the Committee meeting on December 21. 1993. In       foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of       the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies is       about unchanged over the intermeeting period.Growth of M2 and M3 was relatively slow over       December and January. From the fourth quarter of 1992       to the fourth quarter of 1993, M2 and M3 are estimated       to have grown at rates slightly above the lower ends of       the Committee\\'s ranges for the year. Private borrowing       has picked up in recent months and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in the       fourth quarter; for the year, nonfinancial debt is       estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half       of the Committee\\'s monitoring range.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary       and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In       furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this       meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of       1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively,       measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth       quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that       developments contributing to unusual velocity increases       could persist during the year and that money growth       within these ranges would be consistent with its broad       policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of       total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8       percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary       aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light       of progress toward price level stability, movements in       their velocities, and developments in the economy and       financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate       future, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the       existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In       the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for       price stability and sustainable economic growth, and       giving careful consideration to economic, financial,       and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve       restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be       acceptable in the intermeeting period. The       contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be       consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the       first half of 1994.Votes for this action: Messrs.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments   in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions   in government securities and federal agency obligations during the   period February 4, 1994, through March 21, 1994. By unanimous vote,   the Committee ratified these transactions.By unanimous vote, paragraph l(a) of the Authorization for   Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $8 billion   to $11 billion the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System   Account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities for   the intermeeting period ending with the close of business on May 17,   1994.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and   financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the   intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial   information available at the time of the meeting and of the   Committee\\'s discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic   policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the   Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that   economic activity had expanded appreciably further in the early months   of 1994, despite unusually severe winter weather. Consumer spending   and construction activity had been held down to some extent by the   adverse weather conditions, but motor vehicle production had continued   at a very strong pace and business fixed investment appeared to be   headed for a significant gain in the first quarter. Factory   utilization rates had moved still higher, and labor demand seemed to   have grown moderately further. Outside of a surge in energy prices,   increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices remained   moderate.Nonfarm payroll employment was unchanged in January but   posted a February advance comparable to the sizable monthly increases   recorded in the final quarter of 1993. Employment in the service   industries declined slightly in January, then rebounded substantially   in February. Manufacturing payrolls rose in January and February, but   the number of jobs in construction declined in both months, reflecting   that industry\\'s vulnerability to weather disruptions. The civilian   unemployment rate, calculated on the new basis, fell to 6.5 percent in   February: however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cautioned that a   variety of technical factors might have exaggerated the decline in   joblessness in early 1994.After a sharp rise in the fourth quarter, industrial   production increased considerably further in January and February.   Manufacturing output continued to rise, despite the apparent damping   effect of adverse weather on a number of industries. Assemblies of   motor vehicles remained quite buoyant, accounting for more than half   of the increase in manufacturing production in the first two months of   the year and reaching in February their highest level since the late   1970s. Production of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles   also was up in the two months, but the advances were smaller than   those of late 1993. Output of utilities surged in-January, reflecting   the heating demand resulting from abnormally cold temperatures, but   a portion of that gain was retraced in February. Total utilization of   industrial capacity increased in both January and February and was at   relatively elevated levels, judged by historical norms; operating   rates in primary processing industries were especially high.Retail sales were little changed on balance over the first   two months of the year, with sales recovering in February from a large   January decline. By contrast, sales of motor vehicles remained quite   brisk on average over the two months, despite the California   earthquake and the severe weather. Soaring outlays for home heating   contributed to rapid growth of consumer spending on services in   January. The unusual weather also affected housing activity; starts   were down considerably in January and February from the very high   levels of late 1993, and new home sales plunged in January. Sales of   existing homes in January were only slightly below their high December   level.The limited available evidence pointed to a noticeably   smaller gain in business fixed investment in the first quarter of 1994   after a very large increase in the previous quarter. Shipments of   nondefense capital goods slowed in January, retracing part of the   sharp rise of the fourth quarter, but the buoyancy of orders in recent   months pointed to a further increase in shipments in coming months.   Sales of heavy trucks were strong in January, and the backlog of   orders for such vehicles remained large. Nonresidential construction   activity, perhaps owing in part to bad weather, was down in January   after trending up over most of 1993. The largest decline was in   office building, which had posted large increases in the preceding two   months.Business inventories fell slightly in January, and stocks   were lean, especially at manufacturing firms. Inventories in   manufacturing rose, retracing in January part of a large December   decline; much of the January increase was at producers of machinery, where stocks had fallen to very low levels relative to shipments. At   both the wholesale and retail levels, inventories posted sizable   decreases. In the wholesale sector, the inventory-to-sales ratio   edged down and had changed little since May of last year. The   inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector was up slightly,   reflecting weak sales in January.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services,   measured on the new balance-of-payments basis, was slightly smaller in   January than the average for the fourth quarter. However, the January   deficit was substantially larger than that of December, with exports   down by more than imports. Much of the reduction in exports was in   agricultural goods, aircraft, and gold; the drop in imports mainly   reflected both lower quantities and lower prices of imported oil. The   limited available data suggested that economic activity in the major   foreign industrial countries picked up in early 1994 after a mixed   performance in the fourth quarter of 1993.Producer prices of finished goods were boosted in February by   a surge in energy prices, especially for gasoline and heating oil,   that more than offset a further decline in food prices. Excluding the   food and energy components, producer prices edged higher in February:   for the twelve months ended in February, producer prices increased by   a significantly smaller amount than in the twelve-month period ended   in February 1993. At the consumer level, higher energy prices in   February were offset by lower food prices. For items other than food   and energy, consumer prices also rose less over the twelve months   ended in February than in the previous twelve months. Average hourly   earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased more slowly   in February, but for the twelve months ended in February, the advance   was about the same as that recorded for the previous twelve months.At its meeting on February 3-4, 1994, the Committee adopted a   directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure   on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the   likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting   period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee\\'s   long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic   growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and   monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve   restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The   reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be   consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over the first half of   1994.Immediately following the February meeting, Chairman   Greenspan announced the Committee\\'s decision, and open market   operations were directed toward implementing the slightly less   accommodative degree of reserve pressures sought by the Committee.   The federal funds rate increased by 1/4 percentage point and then   remained close to 3-1/4 percent over the intermeeting period, while   adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged a little less than   anticipated.Most other market interest rates rose considerably more than   the federal funds rate in frequently volatile markets. Market   participants generally had anticipated a tightening of monetary   policy, but the Committee\\'s action apparently came a little sooner   than had been expected. Strong fourth-quarter economic data and   evidence of solid growth in early 1994 were seen as suggesting greater   credit demands and the need for higher interest rates in the future to   contain inflation. Heightened trade tensions and unsettled market   conditions abroad also contributed to market concerns. In these   circumstances, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates increased   by appreciably more than short-term money market rates. Major indexes   of stock prices had fallen on balance since early February in   sometimes volatile trading.The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other   G-10 currencies initially rose following the tightening of monetary   policy on February 4. The dollar depreciated over the balance of the   intermeeting period, however, despite higher U.S. interest rates and   the release of data indicating generally strong U.S. economic   activity. The dollar declined against both the Japanese yen and the   German mark, trade frictions between the United States and Japan and   disappointment over the pace of monetary easing in Germany appeared to   be contributing factors in the depreciation of the dollar. Bond   yields in all the major foreign industrial countries rose on average   by almost as much as yields on comparable U.S. bonds.M2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in February. A   substantial drop in mortgage refinancings since late 1993 that   depressed demand deposits, and to a lesser extent savings deposits, contributed to the weakness of M2 in February. M3 also was affected   by a precipitous decline in institution-only money funds as investors   reacted quickly following the monetary tightening to widening spreads   between returns on these funds and higher-yielding short-term   instruments. Data for early March pointed to some rebound in both   monetary aggregates, perhaps owing to portfolio readjustments that   involved sizable net redemptions of bond funds and apparently-weaker   inflows to stock funds. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at   a moderate rate in recent months.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that   economic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth   quarter but that the economy would advance in 1994 at a rate slightly   in excess of the growth of potential. Consumer spending, which had   tended for some time to outpace income growth, was projected to   increase at a rate more in line with disposable incomes; spending on   durable goods, in particular, was projected to slow markedly as stock-adjustment motives diminished and higher interest rates exerted some   restraint. Business fixed investment was expected to increase less   rapidly in 1994, reflecting the diminishing effect of the earlier   pickup in output growth and the slower growth of corporate cash flow.   Homebuilding activity was anticipated to continue at a relatively   brisk pace, spurred by the greater cash-flow affordability of housing   and the good prospects for continued growth in employment and incomes.   The restraint on output growth from federal spending cutbacks and weak   export demand was projected to diminish somewhat. In light of the   limited margins of slack in labor and product markets that were   expected to prevail over the forecast horizon, little further   reduction in the core rate of inflation was expected.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective   economic developments, members referred to widespread indications of   appreciable momentum in the economic expansion and decreasing margins   of unemployed labor and other producer resources. While the members   continued to anticipate a marked slowing in economic growth from the   very rapid pace of the fourth quarter, some commented that despite   unusually severe winter weather in large parts of the country the   deceleration in the current quarter appeared to be less than they had   expected. The indications of continuing strength in aggregate demand   along with a still-accommodative monetary policy suggested a much   reduced risk that the economic expansion would stall. Indeed, members   continued to expect moderate economic growth, though perhaps for a   time at a rate somewhat above the economy\\'s potential. The amount of   resources that could be mobilized readily to meet this demand was   subject to substantial uncertainty, but the degree of slack in the   economy clearly had diminished considerably in recent quarters to   relatively low levels and likely would shrink further. The immediate   outlook for inflation remained favorable: costs and prices were being   contained by moderate wage increases, continuing pressures for   productivity-enhancing investment, and competitive prices from abroad   where slack was still quite ample; and broad measures of money and   credit, though strengthening over the last half of 1993, remained   moderate by historical standards. Nevertheless, looking ahead,   members were concerned that, unless monetary policy were adjusted   further from its still-accommodative stance, pressures on resources   would intensify and inflation would pick up.Members assessed the outlook for economic activity and prices   against the backdrop of sharp changes in bond and, to a lesser extent,   equity prices over the intermeeting period. Clearly, the tightening   of reserve conditions announced on February 4 had played a role in   market movements, but other factors had been at work as well. Members   variously stressed the possibility that the backup in interest rates   had reflected much stronger aggregate demand, added uncertainty about   the course of interest rates, influences from foreign exchange and   foreign capital markets, changes in trading strategies by wary   participants, and rising inflation expectations. On balance,   financial conditions were still seen as supportive of solid economic   expansion, and a number of members referred in particular to the more   accommodative lending policies of many depository institutions;   however, some commented on the risk, which they viewed as having a low   probability, that weakness and volatility in financial markets could   at some point have a significantly inhibiting effect on business and   consumer confidence and spending. To date, business sentiment was   described as quite positive in most parts of the country, and although   there were some exceptions--notably in California--members commented   on numerous indications of improving regional economies.A number of members observed that they expected consumer   spending to be relatively well maintained, buttressed by considerable   strength in expenditures for motor vehicles and other consumer   durables. Reports on retail sales from various parts of the country   tended to support such assessments, and many contacts among retailers   were expressing optimism about the outlook for their sales. At the   same time, some members observed that a number of factors were likely   to limit the potential strength of consumer spending. They referred   in particular to the already low saving rate, relatively high consumer   indebtedness, and recent declines in the value of securities held by   households. More importantly, however, consumer confidence and   spending would continue to depend heavily on the outlook for further   growth in employment and incomes.Business investment expenditures remained on a solid uptrend   as firms continued to focus on the need to control costs and improve   operating efficiencies in the face of vigorous competitive pressures.   Members also cited some examples of investment spending induced by   rising demands pressing against limitations in production capacity.   While business investment had tended to be concentrated in new, more   productive equipment, nonresidential construction also had   strengthened and anecdotal reports from numerous areas tended to   confirm more positive nationwide statistics. The rising levels of   nonresidential construction activity tended to be concentrated in   commercial and industrial facilities and public works projects; the   construction of office buildings continued to lag but this sector   appeared to have stabilized or perhaps improved marginally after a   long period of decline. More generally, currently positive business   attitudes augured well for further growth in overall business   investment, but on the negative side it was noted that further   turbulence in financial markets could erode confidence with adverse   implications for investment spending. Residential construction was   described as quite strong in numerous areas, although overall housing   construction had been held down thus far this year by severe winter   weather in numerous parts of the country. Shortages of skilled   construction workers and building materials were reported in many   areas.Despite generally rising final demands, business firms were   continuing to maintain lean inventory positions in their ongoing   efforts to hold down costs. Nonetheless, with production levels in   many industries approaching or reaching full capacity utilization,   prices of some materials and other business purchases coming under   increasing pressure, and delivery lead times tending to lengthen at   least in some industries, efforts to build inventories could be   expected to materialize and in one view the potential for such a   development represented a key upside risk from current forecasts. In   this connection, some members referred to scattered indications of   efforts to increase inventories, notably of steel products.   Manufacturers of motor vehicles also were in the process of rebuilding   depleted inventories, though the currently stimulative impact of such   rebuilding on overall production was likely to be reversed when motor   vehicle stocks reached desired levels in the months ahead.The foreign trade sector was expected to remain a negative   factor in the economic outlook. However, the members anticipated some   improvement in the economies of major foreign industrial nations   which, together with some moderation in the growth of domestic final   demands, was likely to slow the decline in real net exports. A few   members cited growing indications that last year\\'s NAFTA legislation   would have quite positive effects on U.S. foreign trade, though those   effects were still largely in the future.In the discussion of the outlook for prices and wages, many   of the members expressed concern about the potential for a pickup in   inflation if, as they anticipated, margins of unemployed resources   narrowed further or disappeared. The members acknowledged that broad   measures of prices relating to final purchases and of wages currently   did not suggest any increase in inflation. Indeed, in the view of at   least some members, those measures still suggested on balance that the   inflation trend had retained a downward tilt thus far. In this   connection, some commented that the overall performance of the broad   measures had been somewhat better in recent months than they had   anticipated, especially given the very rapid expansion of the economy   over the closing months of 1993 and the less than expected moderation   thus far this year. Developments that had been exerting a favorable   effect on prices included above-trend growth in productivity,   relatively low prices in world oil markets, and strong competition in   many markets from both domestic and foreign firms. Moreover, the   strong rise in credit usage that often had accompanied intensified   inflation pressures in the past had yet to materialize. To date, the   pickup in price increases had been uneven and had tended to be   concentrated in some regions or industries and in the early stages of   the production process, and a number of members reported that they saw   little change in inflation trends in their areas. Nonetheless,   warning signs had emerged of the prospect of greater inflation, though   perhaps not over the nearer term. These included increases in a wide   range of commodity prices and anecdotal reports from various parts of   the country suggesting a further rise in the number of business firms   that were facing somewhat higher prices of materials and other   purchases and in turn were able, often for the first time in recent   years, to raise their selling prices. Price and wage pressures   appeared to be especially pronounced in the construction industry,   where capacity constraints had been encountered in many localities.   Members also referred to the potential for higher prices in the food   and energy sectors; low crop carryovers for some grains made food   prices vulnerable to unfavorable growing conditions, should they   materialize; oil prices currently were at relative lows but were   likely to come under some upward pressures as world economic growth   accelerated and if political developments led to disruptions in world   supplies. More fundamentally, the relatively robust economic   expansion over the second half of 1993 and the further advance in   early 1994 appeared in the view of many members to have appreciably   diminished the gap between actual and potential GDP and to have   reduced the rate of unemployment to a level that could well be not far   from the natural rate. If this assessment proved to be correct,   further economic expansion at a pace above the economy\\'s potential   would bring more industries and the economy more generally to capacity   production levels before very long and could well-generate growing   inflation thereafter.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting   period ahead, all the members supported a further move toward a less   accommodative policy stance. An initial move in that direction had   been made in early February, but the members still viewed monetary   policy as too stimulative. In this regard, members cited the very low   inflation-adjusted interest rates in short-term debt markets as an   indicator of excessive policy accommodation, and one member also   referred to the rapid growth in reserves and narrow measures of money   over an extended period. While a quite accommodative policy stance   had been entirely appropriate earlier in the economic recovery, when   constraints such as the widespread rebuilding of balance sheets and   business restructuring activities were strongly inhibiting the   expansionary forces in the economy, those constraints had greatly   diminished and the expansion clearly had gained considerable momentum.   In the circumstances, maintaining an accommodative monetary policy   could be expected before too long to foster growing pressures on labor   and capital resources with a resulting pickup in inflation. While   actual inflation remained subdued and credit growth was still damped,   it was only a matter of time before the current monetary policy   induced a surge in credit extensions that could fuel an outbreak of   inflation.In these circumstances, the members concluded that monetary   policy needed to move fairly quickly toward what might be characterized as a more neutral position. Such a policy posture could not be   defined with precision and it undoubtedly varied to some extent with   changing circumstances. Nonetheless, it provided a useful conceptual   approach to policy in current circumstances and could be identified as   a policy stance that sought to foster sustained noninflationary   expansion consistent with the economy\\'s potential. The members   generally concluded that such a policy stance was still some distance   away, and the key issue facing the Committee was not whether but how   promptly the necessary policy adjustment should be completed. Whether   further tightening beyond that point would be needed later could not   be determined at this time but would depend on the potential emergence   of conditions pointing to an acceleration of inflation.As had been the case at the February meeting, views differed   on how much further current monetary policy should be adjusted at this   meeting. Many members noted that money market interest rates would   have to rise by a relatively sizable amount from current levels, given   underlying economic conditions, but a majority indicated a preference   for another small move at this time. Many were concerned about a   possible overreaction in financial markets that had become quite   sensitive and volatile since early February. A few also placed some   emphasis on their expectations of a considerable slowdown in the rate   of economic growth and the possibility that the moderation of the   expansion might prove to be somewhat more pronounced than was   currently projected. In this view, a degree of caution was advisable   to permit an assessment of ongoing developments.Members who preferred a more sizable policy adjustment, or   perhaps a small move through open market operations that was   associated with a rise in the discount rate, believed that the   increasing risks of greater inflation pointed to the need to move more   promptly and decisively away from a policy stance that had become   overly accommodative. A stronger policy action at this point would   serve to underscore the Committee\\'s commitment to its price stability   objective and would help to counteract what some members interpreted   as a significant increase in inflationary expectations since earlier   in the year. A reduction in such expectations would over time have   beneficial implications for bond markets and the economy. In the view   of some members, continued market expectations of further actions to   tighten reserve conditions were themselves contributing to market   instability. Some members also commented that any policy choice   incurred the risk of proving to be wrong, but they viewed the greatest   risk at this juncture to be a policy that allowed inflationary   pressures to gather momentum. A policy decision that in hindsight led   to the implementation of too much restraint could be corrected more   readily and with less damage to the economy in this view.In the Committee\\'s discussion of possible intermeeting   adjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, a majority of the   members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric directive.   While the probability of an easing action during this period was   deemed to be very low, the members also did not see as very likely any   firming over the intermeeting period beyond that to be implemented   after today\\'s meeting. The Committee had embarked on a course of   moving away from an accommodative stance toward one that was more   neutral. The timing of the actions to implement this policy was not   independent of the behavior of the economy, of course, but it was not   as dependent on the nuances of incoming data as policy might be at   other times when the course of policy was less clear. Symmetry did   not rule out an intermeeting adjustment of policy by the Chairman on   behalf of the Committee, as had been done with some frequency in the   past when that seemed warranted by intermeeting developments. Members   who favored an asymmetric directive observed that such a directive   seemed more consistent with the current thrust of monetary policy   toward less accommodation and the related need to respond promptly to   indications of accelerating inflation. These members indicated,   however, that they could support a symmetric directive that was   associated with the prospect of intermeeting consultations.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s policy discussion, all   but two of the members indicated that they could accept a directive   that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve   positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely   direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period.   Accordingly, in the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for   price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful   consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the   Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve   restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period.   According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at   this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3   over the first half of 1994.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of   New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by   the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in   accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests     that economic activity has expanded appreciably further     in the early months of 1994. Severe weather and     changes in statistical methodology distorted movements     in official labor market data in January and February,     but it appears that employment increased somewhat on     balance over the two months and that unemployment fell.     Industrial production also increased substantially over     this period after a sharp rise in the fourth quarter.     Consumer spending and housing activity apparently have     been held down to some extent by adverse weather in     January and February: retail sales were little changed     on balance over the two months and housing starts fell     considerably. Trends in contracts and orders point to     a sizable increase in business fixed investment but at     a rate well below that for the fourth quarter of 1993.     The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services     in January was slightly smaller than the average in the     fourth quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer     and producer prices have remained moderate in recent     months despite a surge in energy prices.Most market interest rates have risen considerably     since the Committee meeting on February 3-4, 1994. In     foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of     the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies     depreciated over the intermeeting period.M2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in     February, but data for early March point to some     rebound in both aggregates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent     months.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary     and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In     furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its     meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2     and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the     fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that     developments contributing to unusual velocity increases     could persist during the year and that money growth     within these ranges would be consistent with its broad     policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of     total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8     percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary     aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light     of progress toward price level stability, movements in     their velocities, and developments in the economy and     financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate     future, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the     existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In     the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for     price stability and sustainable economic growth, and     giving careful consideration to economic, financial,     and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve     restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be     acceptable in the intermeeting period. The     contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be     consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the     first half of 1994.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,     McDonough, Forrestal, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey,     Parry, and Ms. Phillips.Votes against this action: Messrs. Broaddus,     and Jordan.Messrs. Broaddus and Jordan dissented because they preferred   a stronger move toward a more neutral policy stance. In their view,   the recent sharp increases in longer-term interest rates indicated   clearly that inflationary expectations were rising and that the   principal policy risk had become one of remaining accommodative for   too long a period. In this environment, they believed that a more   aggressive move would underscore the Committee\\'s commitment to   fostering sustainable longer-term growth and reduce the risk that a   highly restrictive policy might be required at a later date to contain   inflation.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the desirability   of making an immediate announcement of today\\'s policy decision. All   the members favored prompt disclosure in principle, but some expressed   reservations about announcing today\\'s decision immediately after the   meeting. These members preferred to consider a decision on   announcements of policy actions in the context of a broad range of   disclosure issues, some of which had yet to be fully explored. Some   stressed that they remained concerned about the inhibiting effects of   some types of disclosures on the Committee\\'s deliberations, and one   member emphasized that the Committee also needed to consider the   implications of immediate announcements of changes in open market   policy for the role of the discount rate. Several members commented   that announcing a decision reached at this meeting, because it would   come after a similar announcement following the most recent meeting in   early February, would in effect set a precedent that would tend to   limit the Committee\\'s future options. A majority of the members   concluded, however, that while the Committee was not making a formal, binding decision on this issue at this meeting, the Chairman would be   authorized to release a short press statement regarding today\\'s policy   decision. A useful purpose would be served in reducing or eliminating   potential misinterpretation of the Committee\\'s policy decision and the   related risk of overreactions in financial markets at a time of   considerable uncertainty and volatility in those markets. The news of   the Committee\\'s action would be conveyed unambiguously to the entire   public at once and not filtered through the financial markets\\'   interpretation of open market operations. Moreover, the Committee   would retain the option of specifying the exact contents and timing of   future policy announcements, including intermeeting policy actions.   Most of the members concluded that the advantages to the public of   prompt release today outweighed the potential disadvantages.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be   held on Tuesday, May 17. 1994. This meeting adjourned at 2:05 p.m.At a telephone conference held on March 24, 1994, the   Committee approved a temporary increase, from $700 million to $3.0   billion, in the Federal Reserve System\\'s reciprocal currency (\"swap\")   arrangement with the Bank of Mexico. Concurrently, the U.S. Treasury   announced a $3 billion swap arrangement between the U.S. Exchange   Stabilization Fund and the Bank of Mexico and the Mexican Ministry of   Finance. The System\\'s action was effective immediately and. subject   to certain conditions, it authorized the Bank of Mexico to draw on the   enlarged arrangement until April 29, 1994, with full repayment of any   drawings to be made by July 29, 1994.A permanent increase in the System\\'s swap arrangement with   the Bank of Mexico had been discussed at the Committee\\'s recent   meeting on March 22, and it had been contemplated at that meeting that   the Committee would vote on such an increase during April in the   context of the establishment of a consultative mechanism involving the   finance ministries and central banks of Canada, Mexico, and the United   States. However, the assassination of a major candidate for the   presidency of Mexico on the evening of March 23 had prompted the   closing of Mexican financial markets on March 24 and had given rise to   concerns regarding possible financial market disorder in reaction to   unfolding political developments when those markets reopened. Against   this background, the Committee decided to join the U.S. Treasury in an   action that would help confirm continued U.S. support for Mexico\\'s   economic policies at a potentially critical time for Mexican financial   markets.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,     McDonough, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley, LaWare,     Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.Effective April 26, 1994, the Committee by notation vote   approved a recommendation by Chairman Greenspan to establish an   enlarged swap arrangement of $3 billion on a permanent basis. As is   the case for all swap arrangements, this arrangement is subject to   periodic annual review after an initial maturity date of December 15,   1995. Simultaneously, the maturity date of the System\\'s swap facility   with the Bank of Canada was extended by one year to December 15, 1995.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,     McDonough, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley, LaWare,     Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.The enlarged foreign exchange swap arrangement with the Bank   of Mexico constituted part of a new trilateral foreign exchange swap   facility established in connection with the newly formed consultative   group called the North American Financial Group and comprised of the   Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of Canada, Mexico, and   the United States. The purpose of this standing facility is to expand   the pool of potential resources available to the monetary authorities   of each country to maintain orderly exchange markets. Its   establishment at this time was deemed desirable in light of the   outlook for expanding and increasingly interdependent economic   relationships among the three economies following the successful   conclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement.The components of the trilateral facility include (1) swap   agreements between the United States and Mexico for up to $6.0   billion, with the Treasury and the Federal Reserve each participating   up to $3.0 billion; (2) an expansion of the swap agreement between the   Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico to CAN$1.0 billion; and (3) a   reaffirmation of the existing swap agreement between the Bank of   Canada and the Federal Reserve in the amount of $2.0 billion, with the   above-noted maturity extension.Mr. Broaddus dissented because he was concerned about the   appropriateness of the System\\'s involvement in this type of foreign   currency operation. In his view, the System\\'s swap network raised a   number of broad issues that he felt the Committee needed to review at   some point. Accordingly, he would not favor increasing any existing   swap arrangement until such a review had taken place.At a telephone conference on April 18, Committee members   reviewed economic and financial developments since the March meeting   and discussed the desirability of taking further action to move policy   away from its still accommodative stance. Broad indicators of   economic activity, supported by widespread anecdotal evidence, pointed   to considerable momentum in economic activity and further reductions   in already limited margins of unutilized labor and other production   resources. In financial markets, sharp declines in bond and stock   prices suggested that speculative excesses had been reduced, and   ongoing portfolio realignments probably were shifting long-term   financial assets to firmer hands. As a result, financial markets now   appeared to be less likely to overreact to adverse developments or to   policy actions. In the circumstances, the members supported the   Chairman\\'s decision to reduce the degree of accommodation in reserve   markets slightly further at this time rather than to await the next   regularly scheduled meeting in mid-May. Some members expressed the   view that an increase in the discount rate would provide a desirable   supplement to this policy action.SecretaryReturn to top FOMC Home | Monetary policy Accessibility | Contact UsLast update: August 31, 2010 ', '  Minutes of the Federal Open Market CommitteeMeeting of March 22, 1994A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held in   the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in   Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, March 22, 1994, at 9:00 a.m.PRESENT: Mr. Greenspan, Chairman    Mr. McDonough, Vice Chairman    Mr. Broaddus    Mr. Forrestal    Mr. Jordan    Mr. Kelley    Mr. LaWare    Mr. Lindsey    Mr. Parry    Ms. PhillipsMessrs.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments   in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions   in government securities and federal agency obligations during the   period February 4, 1994, through March 21, 1994. By unanimous vote,   the Committee ratified these transactions.By unanimous vote, paragraph l(a) of the Authorization for   Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $8 billion   to $11 billion the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System   Account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities for   the intermeeting period ending with the close of business on May 17,   1994.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and   financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the   intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial   information available at the time of the meeting and of the   Committee\\'s discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic   policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the   Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that   economic activity had expanded appreciably further in the early months   of 1994, despite unusually severe winter weather. Consumer spending   and construction activity had been held down to some extent by the   adverse weather conditions, but motor vehicle production had continued   at a very strong pace and business fixed investment appeared to be   headed for a significant gain in the first quarter. Factory   utilization rates had moved still higher, and labor demand seemed to   have grown moderately further. Outside of a surge in energy prices,   increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices remained   moderate.Nonfarm payroll employment was unchanged in January but   posted a February advance comparable to the sizable monthly increases   recorded in the final quarter of 1993. Employment in the service   industries declined slightly in January, then rebounded substantially   in February. Manufacturing payrolls rose in January and February, but   the number of jobs in construction declined in both months, reflecting   that industry\\'s vulnerability to weather disruptions. The civilian   unemployment rate, calculated on the new basis, fell to 6.5 percent in   February: however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cautioned that a   variety of technical factors might have exaggerated the decline in   joblessness in early 1994.After a sharp rise in the fourth quarter, industrial   production increased considerably further in January and February.   Manufacturing output continued to rise, despite the apparent damping   effect of adverse weather on a number of industries. Assemblies of   motor vehicles remained quite buoyant, accounting for more than half   of the increase in manufacturing production in the first two months of   the year and reaching in February their highest level since the late   1970s. Production of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles   also was up in the two months, but the advances were smaller than   those of late 1993. Output of utilities surged in-January, reflecting   the heating demand resulting from abnormally cold temperatures, but   a portion of that gain was retraced in February. Total utilization of   industrial capacity increased in both January and February and was at   relatively elevated levels, judged by historical norms; operating   rates in primary processing industries were especially high.Retail sales were little changed on balance over the first   two months of the year, with sales recovering in February from a large   January decline. By contrast, sales of motor vehicles remained quite   brisk on average over the two months, despite the California   earthquake and the severe weather. Soaring outlays for home heating   contributed to rapid growth of consumer spending on services in   January. The unusual weather also affected housing activity; starts   were down considerably in January and February from the very high   levels of late 1993, and new home sales plunged in January. Sales of   existing homes in January were only slightly below their high December   level.The limited available evidence pointed to a noticeably   smaller gain in business fixed investment in the first quarter of 1994   after a very large increase in the previous quarter. Shipments of   nondefense capital goods slowed in January, retracing part of the   sharp rise of the fourth quarter, but the buoyancy of orders in recent   months pointed to a further increase in shipments in coming months.   Sales of heavy trucks were strong in January, and the backlog of   orders for such vehicles remained large. Nonresidential construction   activity, perhaps owing in part to bad weather, was down in January   after trending up over most of 1993. The largest decline was in   office building, which had posted large increases in the preceding two   months.Business inventories fell slightly in January, and stocks   were lean, especially at manufacturing firms. Inventories in   manufacturing rose, retracing in January part of a large December   decline; much of the January increase was at producers of machinery, where stocks had fallen to very low levels relative to shipments. At   both the wholesale and retail levels, inventories posted sizable   decreases. In the wholesale sector, the inventory-to-sales ratio   edged down and had changed little since May of last year. The   inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector was up slightly,   reflecting weak sales in January.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services,   measured on the new balance-of-payments basis, was slightly smaller in   January than the average for the fourth quarter. However, the January   deficit was substantially larger than that of December, with exports   down by more than imports. Much of the reduction in exports was in   agricultural goods, aircraft, and gold; the drop in imports mainly   reflected both lower quantities and lower prices of imported oil. The   limited available data suggested that economic activity in the major   foreign industrial countries picked up in early 1994 after a mixed   performance in the fourth quarter of 1993.Producer prices of finished goods were boosted in February by   a surge in energy prices, especially for gasoline and heating oil,   that more than offset a further decline in food prices. Excluding the   food and energy components, producer prices edged higher in February:   for the twelve months ended in February, producer prices increased by   a significantly smaller amount than in the twelve-month period ended   in February 1993. At the consumer level, higher energy prices in   February were offset by lower food prices. For items other than food   and energy, consumer prices also rose less over the twelve months   ended in February than in the previous twelve months. Average hourly   earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased more slowly   in February, but for the twelve months ended in February, the advance   was about the same as that recorded for the previous twelve months.At its meeting on February 3-4, 1994, the Committee adopted a   directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure   on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the   likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting   period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee\\'s   long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic   growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and   monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve   restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The   reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be   consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over the first half of   1994.Immediately following the February meeting, Chairman   Greenspan announced the Committee\\'s decision, and open market   operations were directed toward implementing the slightly less   accommodative degree of reserve pressures sought by the Committee.   The federal funds rate increased by 1/4 percentage point and then   remained close to 3-1/4 percent over the intermeeting period, while   adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged a little less than   anticipated.Most other market interest rates rose considerably more than   the federal funds rate in frequently volatile markets. Market   participants generally had anticipated a tightening of monetary   policy, but the Committee\\'s action apparently came a little sooner   than had been expected. Strong fourth-quarter economic data and   evidence of solid growth in early 1994 were seen as suggesting greater   credit demands and the need for higher interest rates in the future to   contain inflation. Heightened trade tensions and unsettled market   conditions abroad also contributed to market concerns. In these   circumstances, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates increased   by appreciably more than short-term money market rates. Major indexes   of stock prices had fallen on balance since early February in   sometimes volatile trading.The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other   G-10 currencies initially rose following the tightening of monetary   policy on February 4. The dollar depreciated over the balance of the   intermeeting period, however, despite higher U.S. interest rates and   the release of data indicating generally strong U.S. economic   activity. The dollar declined against both the Japanese yen and the   German mark, trade frictions between the United States and Japan and   disappointment over the pace of monetary easing in Germany appeared to   be contributing factors in the depreciation of the dollar. Bond   yields in all the major foreign industrial countries rose on average   by almost as much as yields on comparable U.S. bonds.M2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in February. A   substantial drop in mortgage refinancings since late 1993 that   depressed demand deposits, and to a lesser extent savings deposits, contributed to the weakness of M2 in February. M3 also was affected   by a precipitous decline in institution-only money funds as investors   reacted quickly following the monetary tightening to widening spreads   between returns on these funds and higher-yielding short-term   instruments. Data for early March pointed to some rebound in both   monetary aggregates, perhaps owing to portfolio readjustments that   involved sizable net redemptions of bond funds and apparently-weaker   inflows to stock funds. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at   a moderate rate in recent months.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that   economic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth   quarter but that the economy would advance in 1994 at a rate slightly   in excess of the growth of potential. Consumer spending, which had   tended for some time to outpace income growth, was projected to   increase at a rate more in line with disposable incomes; spending on   durable goods, in particular, was projected to slow markedly as stock-adjustment motives diminished and higher interest rates exerted some   restraint. Business fixed investment was expected to increase less   rapidly in 1994, reflecting the diminishing effect of the earlier   pickup in output growth and the slower growth of corporate cash flow.   Homebuilding activity was anticipated to continue at a relatively   brisk pace, spurred by the greater cash-flow affordability of housing   and the good prospects for continued growth in employment and incomes.   The restraint on output growth from federal spending cutbacks and weak   export demand was projected to diminish somewhat. In light of the   limited margins of slack in labor and product markets that were   expected to prevail over the forecast horizon, little further   reduction in the core rate of inflation was expected.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective   economic developments, members referred to widespread indications of   appreciable momentum in the economic expansion and decreasing margins   of unemployed labor and other producer resources. While the members   continued to anticipate a marked slowing in economic growth from the   very rapid pace of the fourth quarter, some commented that despite   unusually severe winter weather in large parts of the country the   deceleration in the current quarter appeared to be less than they had   expected. The indications of continuing strength in aggregate demand   along with a still-accommodative monetary policy suggested a much   reduced risk that the economic expansion would stall. Indeed, members   continued to expect moderate economic growth, though perhaps for a   time at a rate somewhat above the economy\\'s potential. The amount of   resources that could be mobilized readily to meet this demand was   subject to substantial uncertainty, but the degree of slack in the   economy clearly had diminished considerably in recent quarters to   relatively low levels and likely would shrink further. The immediate   outlook for inflation remained favorable: costs and prices were being   contained by moderate wage increases, continuing pressures for   productivity-enhancing investment, and competitive prices from abroad   where slack was still quite ample; and broad measures of money and   credit, though strengthening over the last half of 1993, remained   moderate by historical standards. Nevertheless, looking ahead,   members were concerned that, unless monetary policy were adjusted   further from its still-accommodative stance, pressures on resources   would intensify and inflation would pick up.Members assessed the outlook for economic activity and prices   against the backdrop of sharp changes in bond and, to a lesser extent,   equity prices over the intermeeting period. Clearly, the tightening   of reserve conditions announced on February 4 had played a role in   market movements, but other factors had been at work as well. Members   variously stressed the possibility that the backup in interest rates   had reflected much stronger aggregate demand, added uncertainty about   the course of interest rates, influences from foreign exchange and   foreign capital markets, changes in trading strategies by wary   participants, and rising inflation expectations. On balance,   financial conditions were still seen as supportive of solid economic   expansion, and a number of members referred in particular to the more   accommodative lending policies of many depository institutions;   however, some commented on the risk, which they viewed as having a low   probability, that weakness and volatility in financial markets could   at some point have a significantly inhibiting effect on business and   consumer confidence and spending. To date, business sentiment was   described as quite positive in most parts of the country, and although   there were some exceptions--notably in California--members commented   on numerous indications of improving regional economies.A number of members observed that they expected consumer   spending to be relatively well maintained, buttressed by considerable   strength in expenditures for motor vehicles and other consumer   durables. Reports on retail sales from various parts of the country   tended to support such assessments, and many contacts among retailers   were expressing optimism about the outlook for their sales. At the   same time, some members observed that a number of factors were likely   to limit the potential strength of consumer spending. They referred   in particular to the already low saving rate, relatively high consumer   indebtedness, and recent declines in the value of securities held by   households. More importantly, however, consumer confidence and   spending would continue to depend heavily on the outlook for further   growth in employment and incomes.Business investment expenditures remained on a solid uptrend   as firms continued to focus on the need to control costs and improve   operating efficiencies in the face of vigorous competitive pressures.   Members also cited some examples of investment spending induced by   rising demands pressing against limitations in production capacity.   While business investment had tended to be concentrated in new, more   productive equipment, nonresidential construction also had   strengthened and anecdotal reports from numerous areas tended to   confirm more positive nationwide statistics. The rising levels of   nonresidential construction activity tended to be concentrated in   commercial and industrial facilities and public works projects; the   construction of office buildings continued to lag but this sector   appeared to have stabilized or perhaps improved marginally after a   long period of decline. More generally, currently positive business   attitudes augured well for further growth in overall business   investment, but on the negative side it was noted that further   turbulence in financial markets could erode confidence with adverse   implications for investment spending. Residential construction was   described as quite strong in numerous areas, although overall housing   construction had been held down thus far this year by severe winter   weather in numerous parts of the country. Shortages of skilled   construction workers and building materials were reported in many   areas.Despite generally rising final demands, business firms were   continuing to maintain lean inventory positions in their ongoing   efforts to hold down costs. Nonetheless, with production levels in   many industries approaching or reaching full capacity utilization,   prices of some materials and other business purchases coming under   increasing pressure, and delivery lead times tending to lengthen at   least in some industries, efforts to build inventories could be   expected to materialize and in one view the potential for such a   development represented a key upside risk from current forecasts. In   this connection, some members referred to scattered indications of   efforts to increase inventories, notably of steel products.   Manufacturers of motor vehicles also were in the process of rebuilding   depleted inventories, though the currently stimulative impact of such   rebuilding on overall production was likely to be reversed when motor   vehicle stocks reached desired levels in the months ahead.The foreign trade sector was expected to remain a negative   factor in the economic outlook. However, the members anticipated some   improvement in the economies of major foreign industrial nations   which, together with some moderation in the growth of domestic final   demands, was likely to slow the decline in real net exports. A few   members cited growing indications that last year\\'s NAFTA legislation   would have quite positive effects on U.S. foreign trade, though those   effects were still largely in the future.In the discussion of the outlook for prices and wages, many   of the members expressed concern about the potential for a pickup in   inflation if, as they anticipated, margins of unemployed resources   narrowed further or disappeared. The members acknowledged that broad   measures of prices relating to final purchases and of wages currently   did not suggest any increase in inflation. Indeed, in the view of at   least some members, those measures still suggested on balance that the   inflation trend had retained a downward tilt thus far. In this   connection, some commented that the overall performance of the broad   measures had been somewhat better in recent months than they had   anticipated, especially given the very rapid expansion of the economy   over the closing months of 1993 and the less than expected moderation   thus far this year. Developments that had been exerting a favorable   effect on prices included above-trend growth in productivity,   relatively low prices in world oil markets, and strong competition in   many markets from both domestic and foreign firms. Moreover, the   strong rise in credit usage that often had accompanied intensified   inflation pressures in the past had yet to materialize. To date, the   pickup in price increases had been uneven and had tended to be   concentrated in some regions or industries and in the early stages of   the production process, and a number of members reported that they saw   little change in inflation trends in their areas. Nonetheless,   warning signs had emerged of the prospect of greater inflation, though   perhaps not over the nearer term. These included increases in a wide   range of commodity prices and anecdotal reports from various parts of   the country suggesting a further rise in the number of business firms   that were facing somewhat higher prices of materials and other   purchases and in turn were able, often for the first time in recent   years, to raise their selling prices. Price and wage pressures   appeared to be especially pronounced in the construction industry,   where capacity constraints had been encountered in many localities.   Members also referred to the potential for higher prices in the food   and energy sectors; low crop carryovers for some grains made food   prices vulnerable to unfavorable growing conditions, should they   materialize; oil prices currently were at relative lows but were   likely to come under some upward pressures as world economic growth   accelerated and if political developments led to disruptions in world   supplies. More fundamentally, the relatively robust economic   expansion over the second half of 1993 and the further advance in   early 1994 appeared in the view of many members to have appreciably   diminished the gap between actual and potential GDP and to have   reduced the rate of unemployment to a level that could well be not far   from the natural rate. If this assessment proved to be correct,   further economic expansion at a pace above the economy\\'s potential   would bring more industries and the economy more generally to capacity   production levels before very long and could well-generate growing   inflation thereafter.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting   period ahead, all the members supported a further move toward a less   accommodative policy stance. An initial move in that direction had   been made in early February, but the members still viewed monetary   policy as too stimulative. In this regard, members cited the very low   inflation-adjusted interest rates in short-term debt markets as an   indicator of excessive policy accommodation, and one member also   referred to the rapid growth in reserves and narrow measures of money   over an extended period. While a quite accommodative policy stance   had been entirely appropriate earlier in the economic recovery, when   constraints such as the widespread rebuilding of balance sheets and   business restructuring activities were strongly inhibiting the   expansionary forces in the economy, those constraints had greatly   diminished and the expansion clearly had gained considerable momentum.   In the circumstances, maintaining an accommodative monetary policy   could be expected before too long to foster growing pressures on labor   and capital resources with a resulting pickup in inflation. While   actual inflation remained subdued and credit growth was still damped,   it was only a matter of time before the current monetary policy   induced a surge in credit extensions that could fuel an outbreak of   inflation.In these circumstances, the members concluded that monetary   policy needed to move fairly quickly toward what might be characterized as a more neutral position. Such a policy posture could not be   defined with precision and it undoubtedly varied to some extent with   changing circumstances. Nonetheless, it provided a useful conceptual   approach to policy in current circumstances and could be identified as   a policy stance that sought to foster sustained noninflationary   expansion consistent with the economy\\'s potential. The members   generally concluded that such a policy stance was still some distance   away, and the key issue facing the Committee was not whether but how   promptly the necessary policy adjustment should be completed. Whether   further tightening beyond that point would be needed later could not   be determined at this time but would depend on the potential emergence   of conditions pointing to an acceleration of inflation.As had been the case at the February meeting, views differed   on how much further current monetary policy should be adjusted at this   meeting. Many members noted that money market interest rates would   have to rise by a relatively sizable amount from current levels, given   underlying economic conditions, but a majority indicated a preference   for another small move at this time. Many were concerned about a   possible overreaction in financial markets that had become quite   sensitive and volatile since early February. A few also placed some   emphasis on their expectations of a considerable slowdown in the rate   of economic growth and the possibility that the moderation of the   expansion might prove to be somewhat more pronounced than was   currently projected. In this view, a degree of caution was advisable   to permit an assessment of ongoing developments.Members who preferred a more sizable policy adjustment, or   perhaps a small move through open market operations that was   associated with a rise in the discount rate, believed that the   increasing risks of greater inflation pointed to the need to move more   promptly and decisively away from a policy stance that had become   overly accommodative. A stronger policy action at this point would   serve to underscore the Committee\\'s commitment to its price stability   objective and would help to counteract what some members interpreted   as a significant increase in inflationary expectations since earlier   in the year. A reduction in such expectations would over time have   beneficial implications for bond markets and the economy. In the view   of some members, continued market expectations of further actions to   tighten reserve conditions were themselves contributing to market   instability. Some members also commented that any policy choice   incurred the risk of proving to be wrong, but they viewed the greatest   risk at this juncture to be a policy that allowed inflationary   pressures to gather momentum. A policy decision that in hindsight led   to the implementation of too much restraint could be corrected more   readily and with less damage to the economy in this view.In the Committee\\'s discussion of possible intermeeting   adjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, a majority of the   members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric directive.   While the probability of an easing action during this period was   deemed to be very low, the members also did not see as very likely any   firming over the intermeeting period beyond that to be implemented   after today\\'s meeting. The Committee had embarked on a course of   moving away from an accommodative stance toward one that was more   neutral. The timing of the actions to implement this policy was not   independent of the behavior of the economy, of course, but it was not   as dependent on the nuances of incoming data as policy might be at   other times when the course of policy was less clear. Symmetry did   not rule out an intermeeting adjustment of policy by the Chairman on   behalf of the Committee, as had been done with some frequency in the   past when that seemed warranted by intermeeting developments. Members   who favored an asymmetric directive observed that such a directive   seemed more consistent with the current thrust of monetary policy   toward less accommodation and the related need to respond promptly to   indications of accelerating inflation. These members indicated,   however, that they could support a symmetric directive that was   associated with the prospect of intermeeting consultations.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s policy discussion, all   but two of the members indicated that they could accept a directive   that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve   positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely   direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period.   Accordingly, in the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for   price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful   consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the   Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve   restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period.   According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at   this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3   over the first half of 1994.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of   New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by   the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in   accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests     that economic activity has expanded appreciably further     in the early months of 1994. Severe weather and     changes in statistical methodology distorted movements     in official labor market data in January and February,     but it appears that employment increased somewhat on     balance over the two months and that unemployment fell.     Industrial production also increased substantially over     this period after a sharp rise in the fourth quarter.     Consumer spending and housing activity apparently have     been held down to some extent by adverse weather in     January and February: retail sales were little changed     on balance over the two months and housing starts fell     considerably. Trends in contracts and orders point to     a sizable increase in business fixed investment but at     a rate well below that for the fourth quarter of 1993.     The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services     in January was slightly smaller than the average in the     fourth quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer     and producer prices have remained moderate in recent     months despite a surge in energy prices.Most market interest rates have risen considerably     since the Committee meeting on February 3-4, 1994. In     foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of     the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies     depreciated over the intermeeting period.M2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in     February, but data for early March point to some     rebound in both aggregates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent     months.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary     and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In     furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its     meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2     and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the     fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that     developments contributing to unusual velocity increases     could persist during the year and that money growth     within these ranges would be consistent with its broad     policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of     total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8     percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary     aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light     of progress toward price level stability, movements in     their velocities, and developments in the economy and     financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate     future, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the     existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In     the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for     price stability and sustainable economic growth, and     giving careful consideration to economic, financial,     and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve     restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be     acceptable in the intermeeting period. The     contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be     consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the     first half of 1994.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,     McDonough, Forrestal, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey,     Parry, and Ms. Phillips.Votes against this action: Messrs. Broaddus,     and Jordan.Messrs. Broaddus and Jordan dissented because they preferred   a stronger move toward a more neutral policy stance. In their view,   the recent sharp increases in longer-term interest rates indicated   clearly that inflationary expectations were rising and that the   principal policy risk had become one of remaining accommodative for   too long a period. In this environment, they believed that a more   aggressive move would underscore the Committee\\'s commitment to   fostering sustainable longer-term growth and reduce the risk that a   highly restrictive policy might be required at a later date to contain   inflation.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the desirability   of making an immediate announcement of today\\'s policy decision. All   the members favored prompt disclosure in principle, but some expressed   reservations about announcing today\\'s decision immediately after the   meeting. These members preferred to consider a decision on   announcements of policy actions in the context of a broad range of   disclosure issues, some of which had yet to be fully explored. Some   stressed that they remained concerned about the inhibiting effects of   some types of disclosures on the Committee\\'s deliberations, and one   member emphasized that the Committee also needed to consider the   implications of immediate announcements of changes in open market   policy for the role of the discount rate. Several members commented   that announcing a decision reached at this meeting, because it would   come after a similar announcement following the most recent meeting in   early February, would in effect set a precedent that would tend to   limit the Committee\\'s future options. A majority of the members   concluded, however, that while the Committee was not making a formal, binding decision on this issue at this meeting, the Chairman would be   authorized to release a short press statement regarding today\\'s policy   decision. A useful purpose would be served in reducing or eliminating   potential misinterpretation of the Committee\\'s policy decision and the   related risk of overreactions in financial markets at a time of   considerable uncertainty and volatility in those markets. The news of   the Committee\\'s action would be conveyed unambiguously to the entire   public at once and not filtered through the financial markets\\'   interpretation of open market operations. Moreover, the Committee   would retain the option of specifying the exact contents and timing of   future policy announcements, including intermeeting policy actions.   Most of the members concluded that the advantages to the public of   prompt release today outweighed the potential disadvantages.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be   held on Tuesday, May 17. 1994. This meeting adjourned at 2:05 p.m.At a telephone conference held on March 24, 1994, the   Committee approved a temporary increase, from $700 million to $3.0   billion, in the Federal Reserve System\\'s reciprocal currency (\"swap\")   arrangement with the Bank of Mexico. Concurrently, the U.S. Treasury   announced a $3 billion swap arrangement between the U.S. Exchange   Stabilization Fund and the Bank of Mexico and the Mexican Ministry of   Finance. The System\\'s action was effective immediately and. subject   to certain conditions, it authorized the Bank of Mexico to draw on the   enlarged arrangement until April 29, 1994, with full repayment of any   drawings to be made by July 29, 1994.A permanent increase in the System\\'s swap arrangement with   the Bank of Mexico had been discussed at the Committee\\'s recent   meeting on March 22, and it had been contemplated at that meeting that   the Committee would vote on such an increase during April in the   context of the establishment of a consultative mechanism involving the   finance ministries and central banks of Canada, Mexico, and the United   States. However, the assassination of a major candidate for the   presidency of Mexico on the evening of March 23 had prompted the   closing of Mexican financial markets on March 24 and had given rise to   concerns regarding possible financial market disorder in reaction to   unfolding political developments when those markets reopened. Against   this background, the Committee decided to join the U.S. Treasury in an   action that would help confirm continued U.S. support for Mexico\\'s   economic policies at a potentially critical time for Mexican financial   markets.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,     McDonough, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley, LaWare,     Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.Effective April 26, 1994, the Committee by notation vote   approved a recommendation by Chairman Greenspan to establish an   enlarged swap arrangement of $3 billion on a permanent basis. As is   the case for all swap arrangements, this arrangement is subject to   periodic annual review after an initial maturity date of December 15,   1995. Simultaneously, the maturity date of the System\\'s swap facility   with the Bank of Canada was extended by one year to December 15, 1995.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,     McDonough, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley, LaWare,     Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.The enlarged foreign exchange swap arrangement with the Bank   of Mexico constituted part of a new trilateral foreign exchange swap   facility established in connection with the newly formed consultative   group called the North American Financial Group and comprised of the   Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of Canada, Mexico, and   the United States. The purpose of this standing facility is to expand   the pool of potential resources available to the monetary authorities   of each country to maintain orderly exchange markets. Its   establishment at this time was deemed desirable in light of the   outlook for expanding and increasingly interdependent economic   relationships among the three economies following the successful   conclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement.The components of the trilateral facility include (1) swap   agreements between the United States and Mexico for up to $6.0   billion, with the Treasury and the Federal Reserve each participating   up to $3.0 billion; (2) an expansion of the swap agreement between the   Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico to CAN$1.0 billion; and (3) a   reaffirmation of the existing swap agreement between the Bank of   Canada and the Federal Reserve in the amount of $2.0 billion, with the   above-noted maturity extension.Mr. Broaddus dissented because he was concerned about the   appropriateness of the System\\'s involvement in this type of foreign   currency operation. In his view, the System\\'s swap network raised a   number of broad issues that he felt the Committee needed to review at   some point. Accordingly, he would not favor increasing any existing   swap arrangement until such a review had taken place.At a telephone conference on April 18, Committee members   reviewed economic and financial developments since the March meeting   and discussed the desirability of taking further action to move policy   away from its still accommodative stance. Broad indicators of   economic activity, supported by widespread anecdotal evidence, pointed   to considerable momentum in economic activity and further reductions   in already limited margins of unutilized labor and other production   resources. In financial markets, sharp declines in bond and stock   prices suggested that speculative excesses had been reduced, and   ongoing portfolio realignments probably were shifting long-term   financial assets to firmer hands. As a result, financial markets now   appeared to be less likely to overreact to adverse developments or to   policy actions. In the circumstances, the members supported the   Chairman\\'s decision to reduce the degree of accommodation in reserve   markets slightly further at this time rather than to await the next   regularly scheduled meeting in mid-May. Some members expressed the   view that an increase in the discount rate would provide a desirable   supplement to this policy action.SecretaryReturn to top FOMC Home | Monetary policy Accessibility | Contact UsLast update: August 31, 2010 ', \"  Minutes of the Federal Open Market CommitteeMeeting of     May 17, 1994A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held in   the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in   Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, May 17, 1994, at 9:00 a.m.PRESENT: Mr. Greenspan, Chairman    Mr. McDonough, Vice Chairman    Mr. Broaddus    Mr. Forrestal    Mr. Jordan    Mr. Kelley    Mr. LaWare    Mr. Lindsey    Mr. Parry    Ms. PhillipsMessrs.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments   in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions   in government securities and federal agency obligations during the   period March 22, 1994, through May 16, 1994. By unanimous vote, the   Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and   financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the   intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial   information available at the time of the meeting and of the   Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic   policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the   Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that   economic activity had expanded substantially on balance thus far in   1994. Favorable business expectations and buoyant consumer sentiment   in the context of stronger gains in employment appeared to have   sustained strong growth in domestic final demand. Broad measures of   inflation had remained subdued and labor cost increases had been   moderate, though prices of industrial materials had continued to rise.Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in March and   April, in part reflecting a rebound in industries affected by earlier   severe winter weather; for the first four months of the year, the   average monthly rise exceeded the improved pace of the fourth quarter.   Further large advances in employment in the March-April period were   recorded in the services sector, notably at personnel supply services   firms; hiring in construction was strong after earlier weather-related   losses; and the number of jobs in manufacturing continued to expand,   although at a somewhat slower pace than in previous months. The   civilian unemployment rate registered another slight decline in April,   to 6.4 percent, and the average workweek of production or   nonsupervisory workers remained at an unusually high level.Industrial production was up appreciably further in April,   with increases widespread across sectors. The pace of motor vehicle   assemblies slowed, but much of the indicated slowdown reflected the   effects of seasonal adjustment, which called for increases at a time   when manufacturing operations already were at levels close to   capacity. Output of public utilities fell again, as electricity   generation dropped with the return to less severe weather patterns.   Rates of industrial capacity utilization had risen rapidly in recent   months and were at very high levels in many industries--especially in   motor vehicles, petroleum refining, lumber, and primary metals.Retail sales were estimated to have fallen in April after two   months of very large increases. Despite the April decline, which was   widespread by type of retail outlet, outlays were considerably above   the first-quarter average. Sales of new and existing homes posted   significant gains in March although they remained below their fourth-quarter averages. Housing starts decreased slightly in April but were   well above the depressed winter pace. The third consecutive monthly   gain in multifamily starts was more than offset by a decline in   single-family starts.Real business fixed investment continued to increase rapidly   in the first quarter, but at a less robust pace than in the fourth   quarter of 1993. Outlays for producers durable equipment posted   another sizable advance, spending for computing equipment surged   again, and purchases of most other types of equipment also continued   to trend up. Moreover, business demand for automobiles and trucks   remained strong. Outlays for nonresidential structures declined   sharply in the first quarter, although construction activity showed   some recovery in March after the disruptions associated with severe   weather during January and February.Business inventories declined in March, reversing part of the   large run-up in stocks that had occurred in the first two months of   the year. For the first quarter as a whole, inventories rose at a   slightly slower pace than in the second half of last year. In   manufacturing, the accumulation in the first quarter retraced much of   the drawdown that had taken place in previous months; the inventory-to-shipments ratio, already at a low level, edged still lower.   Wholesale inventories were down on balance over the first quarter,   with a large March decline more than retracing increases earlier in   the year; the ratio of inventories to sales was well below the range   prevailing over the last several years. Retail inventories expanded   modestly in the first quarter, and the inventory-to-sales ratio fell   slightly.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was   larger on average in January and February than it had been in the   fourth quarter. The value of exports in the January-February period   was sharply below the unusually strong level in the fourth quarter but   was slightly higher than the levels recorded in the first three   quarters of 1993. Exports were down in virtually all major trade   categories; one important exception was semiconductors, for which   exports continued to trend higher. Imports in the two-month period   fell by less than exports; nearly all of the decline reflected reduced   oil imports. Available indicators for the first quarter pointed to   recovery in economic activity at a moderate pace on average in the   major foreign industrial countries. Signs of recovery ranged from   quite tentative in Japan to relatively well-established in the United   Kingdom and Canada.Indexes of consumer and producer prices had increased   slightly thus far in 1994. In April, consumer prices posted their   smallest rise since January; food prices were up a bit further, but   energy prices retraced their March run-up. Excluding the food and   energy components of the index, consumer prices edged up in April, and   over the twelve months ending in April these prices increased less   than they had over the previous twelve months. Producer prices of   finished goods declined a little in April as prices of finished foods   and energy moved down; for items other than food and energy, prices   were up slightly in April and for the twelve months ending in April.   At earlier stages of processing, the index of producer prices of crude   materials other than food and energy was substantially above its year-ago level, despite a small drop in April. At the intermediate stage,   the prices of some important construction materials had increased   sharply although, overall, prices of nonfood, non-energy goods had   risen only modestly over the past twelve months.Increases in labor costs continued to moderate in early 1994.   The employment cost index for private industry workers rose more   slowly in the first quarter of 1994 than in any quarter of 1993. The   slowdown reflected more moderate growth in both wages and salaries and   benefit costs. Hourly compensation increased at a slightly slower   pace over the twelve months ending in March 1994 than over the   previous year. In April, average hourly earnings of production or   nonsupervisory workers on nonfarm payrolls increased moderately after   having changed little over February and March.At its meeting on March 22, 1994, the Committee adopted a   directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure   on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the   likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting   period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's   long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic   growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and   monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve   restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The   reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be   consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over the first half of   1994.Immediately after the meeting, open market operations were   directed toward implementing the slightly less accommodative degree of   reserve pressure sought by the Committee. Subsequently, on April 18,   against the background of incoming data suggesting considerable   momentum and diminishing slack in the economy and of indications that   financial markets were less likely to be destabilized by a further   policy action, the degree of accommodation in reserve pressures was   reduced a little further. The federal funds rate rose 1/4 percentage   point, to 3-1/2 percent, after the initial policy action; following   the second policy move, the funds rate went up another 1/4 percentage   point and generally remained near 3-3/4 percent. Over the   intermeeting period, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged   slightly above anticipated levels.Most market interest rates increased by more than the federal   funds rate over the period since the March meeting, with the largest   increases occurring at intermediate maturities. Weakness in the   dollar as well as the release of data suggesting considerable vigor in   economic activity appeared to have contributed to the upward pressure   on market rates. The bank prime rate was raised 3/4 percentage point,   to 6-3/4 percent, while major indexes of stock prices fell   substantially.In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the   dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat further   on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar's depreciation   occurred despite the implementation of less accommodative policy   actions in the United States and monetary easing moves in several key   foreign countries. Market concerns about political developments in   Japan as well as a worsened outlook for progress toward more open   trading relationships and for a more stimulative fiscal policy in that   country contributed to downward pressure on the dollar. Against the   backdrop of a falling dollar, U.S. authorities conducted intervention   operations on April 29 and again on May 4. The latter operations were   coupled with a statement by Treasury Secretary Bentsen indicating that   intervention was being undertaken in response to recent movements in   exchange markets that had gone beyond what could be justified by   economic fundamentals and was being conducted in concert with   operations by other major countries. Subsequent to these actions, the   dollar retraced part of its earlier decline.Growth of M2 and M3 turned up, on balance, in March and   April despite the rising short-term opportunity costs of holding   deposits. The strengthening of these aggregates seemed to be related   to a reassessment by households of the relative attractiveness of   investing in capital market instruments; capital losses sparked   substantial net redemptions at bond mutual funds over March and April   that were accompanied by a surge in flows to retail money market funds   and slower runoffs of small time deposits. For the year through   April, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat below the middle of its range   for 1994, and M3 at a pace somewhat above the lower end of its range.   Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate   rate over recent months.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that   economic activity, after rebounding from the disruptions caused by   adverse weather conditions earlier in the year, would expand in the   second half of 1994 at a rate close to the growth of the economy's   potential. Consumer spending, which had outpaced gains in household   income for some time, was projected to slow to a growth rate more in   line with the expansion of income; with pent-up demands apparently   reduced and somewhat higher interest rates exerting a damping effect,   much of the slowing was expected to be centered on outlays for durable   goods. Business fixed investment would be restrained by the slower   growth of business output and the associated moderation of corporate   cash flows but would continue to advance at a faster rate than overall   economic activity. Homebuilding was projected to remain at a pace   that was relatively robust compared with the rate of recent years,   though a bit below that of the fourth quarter. The restraint on   output growth from federal spending cutbacks and weak export demand   was expected to diminish somewhat. In light of limited margins of   slack in labor and product markets over the forecast horizon, little   or no further reduction in the core rate of inflation was anticipated.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective   developments, members commented on widespread indications, both   statistical and anecdotal, of considerable momentum in the economic   expansion. Business activity seemed to be rebounding smartly from the   disruptive effects of unusually severe winter weather, and it appeared   that the expansion over the first half of the year was likely to be a   little stronger than had been expected at the time of the March   meeting. A deceleration in activity still seemed to be in train for   the second half, but the extent of such a slowing was an important   source of uncertainty in the outlook. The members continued to see   moderate growth at a rate in line with or slightly above the economy's   potential as the most likely prospect, but the overall momentum of the   expansion and the still accommodative stance of monetary policy   suggested that there was an appreciable risk of faster growth for a   period, with consequent implications for greater pressures on   resources. At the same time, the members saw relatively few signs of   the kinds of imbalances that would pose a significant downside   potential for the economy, although some cautioned that the rise in   long-term interest rates, recently weaker data on production and   sales, and continuing anxiety about job security in an environment of   corporate restructuring contributed elements of fragility to what was   otherwise a healthy outlook. The near-term prospects for inflation   were favorable. Wage and price trends generally remained moderate;   the persisting high rate of business investment bode well for further   enhancements of productivity; and competitive pressures, including   those from imported goods, were restraining efforts by firms to raise   prices. The members were concerned, however, that in an environment   in which slack in the economy already had been reduced to a fairly low   level and could decline further in the quarters ahead, inflation could   begin to rise unless monetary policy were adjusted further from its   accommodative stance.In their comments about developments across the nation,   members took note of the considerable strength in economic conditions   in many parts of the country. However, they also recognized that some   parts of the nation were experiencing relatively subdued growth and   that economic activity remained depressed in other areas such as   Southern California and Hawaii. The strong forward momentum in the   economy was most clearly evident in interest-sensitive sectors,   including motor vehicles, other durable goods, and housing. The rise   in interest rates over the course of recent months was cited by   business contacts as a potential source of restraint on interest-sensitive expenditures, but thus far relatively few contacts had   reported actual examples of adverse interest-rate effects on spending.   While higher rates would constrain aggregate demand going forward,   their effects probably would be offset in part by more aggressive   lending practices at banks and other institutions. At the same time,   reports of industries that were operating at or near capacity limits   were becoming more numerous, and capacity constraints were said to be   limiting some sales.With regard to the outlook for key sectors of the economy,   consumer expenditures were viewed by many members as likely to be well   maintained, particularly for motor vehicles and other consumer   durables. Reports from various parts of the country indicated that   sales had tended in many areas to exceed retailers' expectations by a   considerable margin in recent months. Some members noted, however,   that sales had been less ebullient since late winter and cited factors   that might work to restrain somewhat the growth of consumer spending.   These included high and rising debt levels, declines in household   wealth owing to the drop in stock and bond prices, and the effects on   consumer confidence of ongoing workforce reductions associated with   business restructuring. Higher interest rates also might limit the   pace at which pent-up demands would continue to be satisfied. On   balance, in the view of a number of members, growth in consumer   spending seemed likely to moderate to a pace close to the growth in   incomes.Members expected business fixed investment to continue to   expand at a pace substantially above that of the economy as a whole.   With production straining capacity limits in a number of industries   and firms striving for cost savings and productivity improvements to   maintain their competitiveness, real outlays for producers' durable   equipment were likely to stay on a strong upward trend despite an   anticipated deceleration in business output and the recently increased   cost of external capital associated with higher interest rates and   lower equity prices. It was noted in this connection that order books   at producers of capital equipment had grown considerably.   Nonresidential construction appeared to be rebounding from the   disruptive effects of unusually severe winter weather conditions;   however, the pattern of construction activity across the nation was   mixed, with some areas of the country displaying considerable strength   in activity and other areas still depressed. The construction of   office buildings for the most part remained at very low levels, but   anecdotal reports indicated that markets for office space, especially   those that had been hard hit in recent years, seemed to be improving   considerably in some locales. Business inventories remained quite   lean by historical standards, and some reports suggested that efforts   to augment stocks had been negated by strong sales. With survey   reports indicating that order backlogs had grown and lead times on   materials deliveries had lengthened, the possibility was increasing   that desired inventory ratios might be adjusted upward and some pickup   in inventory investment might get under way, especially in   manufacturing where stocks-to-sales ratios recently had fallen to new   lows.Residential construction was indicated to be robust across   much of the country, with activity picking up rapidly in the aftermath   of the unusually severe winter. The affordability of housing remained   high by historical standards, and the appeal of home ownership had   been enhanced somewhat by the apparent firming of house prices over   the past year. In these circumstances, housing activity had been well   sustained, although there were some indications that the higher   mortgage rates now prevailing had begun to damp residential   investment.The foreign trade sector was expected to continue to exert   some drag on economic growth, but the members saw this as likely to   lessen as an anticipated gradual pickup in economic activity among key   trading partners bolstered demand for U.S. exports while imports were   restrained by a projected moderation in the growth of U.S. domestic   demand. In the view of one member, the export sector would tend to   sustain and perhaps become an important stimulus to growth in the   United States as earlier declines in the dollar, taken in conjunction   with technological improvements and higher product quality, enhanced   the competitiveness of U.S. exports.In their discussion of the outlook for prices and wages, the   members noted that broad measures of inflation remained subdued and   increases in labor costs had been moderate. Nevertheless, they   continued to be concerned that inflation could begin to rise if growth   in excess of potential were to persist and margins of unutilized   production resources were to shrink further, or even disappear.   Production already had reached capacity limits in a number of   industries, including motor vehicles and steel, and prices of some raw   materials and intermediate goods had risen substantially over the past   year. Ongoing efforts to expand production capacity through   productivity-enhancing investment and the hiring of additional workers   were likely to be of some help in meeting growing demands, but an   increasing number of contacts were reporting that business firms were   taking advantage of opportunities to adjust prices upward. There also   were indications of shortages of qualified workers in some labor   markets or industries, but to date there were only limited signs of   upward wage pressures and these did not seem to signal a near-term   emergence of general upward cost pressures on prices. Indeed, even   with sales strong, many business contacts were reporting that intense   competition, in part from imports, was curbing or negating efforts to   raise prices. Firms were continuing to look primarily to improvements   in productivity and quality to bolster their profit margins, although   there also were reports that price discounting was lessening and that   sales promotions were becoming less frequent. Price and wage   pressures were most clearly evident and widespread in the construction   industry, where resource constraints appeared to be most pronounced.In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the   period until the meeting in early July, the members favored prompt   further action to remove much of the remaining accommodation in the   stance of monetary policy, at least as measured by real short-term   interest rates. Many members commented that the expansion was on a   solid and self-sustaining basis and appeared to have more underlying   strength than they had foreseen earlier. The stimulative effects of   an expansionary monetary policy had become increasingly apparent--especially in business purchases of capital equipment and consumer   spending on housing, motor vehicles, and other consumer durables. At   the same time, the constraints on economic expansion that had been   associated with business restructuring activities, widespread efforts   to strengthen balance sheets, and other retarding forces had   diminished considerably. The financial health of the banking system   was greatly improved, and banking institutions had evidenced a growing   willingness to make new loans. Moreover, the demand for bank loans,   which had been sluggish for several years, now appeared to be on the   rise. While a series of small steps earlier this year had already   reduced the degree of accommodation in monetary policy and inflation   was subdued for the time being, the members were concerned that   continued policy accommodation could be expected to lead before long   to growing pressures on production resources and to a fresh outbreak   of inflation.In the circumstances, all the members agreed that a further   tightening action was needed at this point; and, in order to better   assure that the remaining degree of policy accommodation had been   largely removed, the adjustment should fully reflect the 1/2   percentage point increase in the discount rate that the Board of   Governors was expected to approve later in the day. The actions taken   earlier in the year had been modest in size because of concerns that   more aggressive steps might generate substantial uncertainty and undue   disruptions in financial markets, with adverse consequences for the   economy. Even though financial markets remained volatile, speculative   sentiment and holdings seemed to have been reduced to a marked extent,   and financial markets appeared to be in a much better position to   absorb needed policy adjustments. Accordingly, a stronger action   probably would not produce an unduly adverse market response and could   well have a settling effect on the markets. A number of members   cautioned that the Committee could not be sure that today's policy   actions, along with those implemented earlier this year, had produced   a policy stance that would foster economic growth at a sustainable,   non-inflationary pace. Thus, the Committee would have to remain alert   to economic and financial developments that might signal the need for   further tightening.In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting   adjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, all but one of the   members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric directive.   Symmetry would be consistent with a judgment that further policy   adjustment likely would not be needed during the intermeeting period   ahead and, in particular, that additional tightening would not be   triggered unless inflation pressures greater than those currently   anticipated were to emerge. The adoption of a symmetric directive   would not preclude an intermeeting consultation and possible   adjustment by the Chairman on behalf of the Committee if such were   warranted by intermeeting developments. One member expressed a   preference for an asymmetric directive. In his view, a symmetric   directive might be mistakenly interpreted both in the United States   and abroad as a signal that the Committee believed that policy   neutrality definitely had been achieved and that there was no need to   allow for the possibility of further tightening.At the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all   the members indicated they could support a directive that called for   increasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions,   taking account of a possible increase in the discount rate, and that   did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any   adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in   the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability   and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to   economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided   that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be   acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff   analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be   consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of   New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by   the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in   accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests     that economic activity has expanded substantially on     balance thus far in 1994. Nonfarm payroll employment     increased sharply in March and April, in part     reflecting a rebound in sectors affected by severe     winter weather; the civilian unemployment rate fell     slightly further in April, to 6.4 percent. Industrial     production was up appreciably in April after a strong     rise over the previous two quarters. Advance data on     retail sales indicate a decline in April, after very     large increases in February and March. Housing starts     fell slightly in April but remained well above the     depressed winter pace. Orders for nondefense capital     goods point to a continued strong uptrend in spending     on business equipment, while nonresidential building     has shown some recovery after severe weather disrupted     construction during January and February. The nominal     deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened on     average in January and February from the fourth-quarter     rate. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and     producer prices remained moderate through April, though     prices of industrial materials continued to rise.Market interest rates have posted large additional     increases since the Committee meeting on March 22,     1994. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted     value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10     currencies declined somewhat further on balance over     the intermeeting period.Growth of M2 and M3 picked up on average in March     and April; for the year through April, M2 expanded at a     rate somewhat below the middle of its range for 1994     and M3 at a pace somewhat above the bottom of its     range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded     at a moderate rate in recent months.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary     and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In     furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its     meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2     and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the     fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that     developments contributing to unusual velocity increases     could persist during the year and that money growth     within these ranges would be consistent with its broad     policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of     total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8     percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary     aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light     of progress toward price level stability, movements in     their velocities, and developments in the economy and     financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate     future, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the     existing degree of pressure on reserve positions,     taking account of a possible increase in the discount     rate. In the context of the Committee's long-run     objectives for price stability and sustainable economic     growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,     financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater     reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint     might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The     contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be     consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming     months.Votes for this action: Messrs.

Attended portion of the meeting relating to the Committee's   discussion of the economic outlook and its longer-run growth   objectives for monetary and debt aggregates.Secretary's Note: Advice had been received that Alan S.     Blinder had executed his oath of office as a member of the     Federal Open Market Committee.By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal   Open Market Committee held on May 17, 1994, were approved.The Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments   in foreign exchange markets and on System open market transactions in   foreign currencies during the period May 17, 1994, to July 5, 1994.The Committee ratified these transactions.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,   McDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Kelley,   LaWare, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.Votes against this action: Messrs. Jordan and   Lindsey.Messrs. Jordan and Lindsey dissented from this action,   although they agreed that the foreign exchange transactions conducted   during the intermeeting period were authorized under the Committee's   rules. Their dissents were based on their strong reservations about   the efficacy of sterilized intervention in most circumstances,   including those prevailing during the intermeeting period. In their   view, to the extent that repeated intervention failed to achieve   stated or perceived objectives, questions would tend to arise about   the credibility of monetary policy more generally.The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments   in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions   in government securities and federal agency obligations during the   period May 17, 1994, to July 5, 1994. By unanimous vote, the   Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and   financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the   intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial   information available at the time of the meeting and of the   Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic   policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the   Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that   economic activity recorded another substantial gain in the second   quarter. Although consumer spending and homebuying apparently had   increased at a slower pace, business spending on durable equipment   remained quite strong and investment in nonresidential structures   rebounded from a weather-depressed level in the first quarter. In   addition, the rate of nonfarm inventory investment evidently had   picked up in the second quarter. Levels of resource utilization had   risen further: factory operating rates were at relatively high levels,   and the slack in labor markets had narrowed considerably over the   first half of the year to what appeared to be very low levels.   Increases in consumer and producer prices had remained moderate in   recent months, but prices of many basic industrial materials had   risen.Nonfarm payroll employment advanced somewhat less rapidly in   May after the brisk increases of recent months; however, the average   workweek of production and nonsupervisory workers reached its highest   level since 1987. The reduction in job gains was widespread by   sector--including business services; finance, insurance, and real   estate; manufacturing; and construction. Employment in transportation   rebounded, reflecting the end of a Teamsters strike. The civilian   unemployment rate, measured on the new basis introduced in January,   declined sharply in May, to 6.0 percent; the decline might have been   overstated as a result of seasonal adjustment problems, but even after   correcting for these factors, the unemployment rate had fallen sharply   since late 1993.The rise in industrial production slackened in April and May   after strong first-quarter gains. Much of the slowing was the result   of capacity constraints that prevented normal seasonal increases in   the production of motor vehicles. Growth of output of manufactured   goods other than motor vehicles and parts was at a slightly less   robust pace than in the first quarter but close to the rapid rate seen   in 1993; business equipment and construction supplies continued to be   areas of strength. The overall rate of utilization in manufacturing   stayed at a high level in May, with most major industry groups   operating at or near capacity. In addition to motor vehicles,   capacity constraints were evident in the petroleum products and   nonelectrical machinery industry groups and in some individual product   lines in other industries.Real personal consumption expenditures fell on balance in   April and May after a strong advance earlier in the year, but the   level of expenditures for the two months combined was a little above   the first-quarter average. The recent slowdown in consumer spending   in large part reflected reduced outlays for motor vehicles. Spending   for durable goods other than motor vehicles increased over April and   May at about the first-quarter pace. Outlays for nondurable goods   were down on balance in April and May, while spending for services in   May more than reversed a small April decline. Housing activity had   rebounded from weather disruptions early in the year to a pace close   to the elevated fourth-quarter rate. Single-family starts edged down   in May after declining substantially in April but were still at a   relatively high level. While the cash-flow affordability of home   ownership had fallen since late last year, it remained at favorable   levels in comparison with recent years. Multifamily starts in May   were at their highest level in more than three years; most of the   pickup occurred in the South, where vacancy rates had declined   recently.Shipments of nondefense capital goods other than aircraft and   parts posted a further solid gain in May, although the upward trend   appeared to have moderated in recent months. Sales of heavy trucks   also were strong in April and May. Shipments of aircraft declined   sharply in April (latest available data), retracing much of a March   surge. Available data on orders for nondefense capital goods pointed   to a continued strong uptrend in business spending on durable   equipment. Nonresidential construction picked up in April and May   from a weather-depressed slump in the first quarter.Business inventories increased in April, more than reversing   a March runoff; the overall pace of accumulation remained moderate,   and buildups were largely concentrated in segments of the economy   where market demand was robust. In manufacturing, inventories   increased in April and May after a small drawdown in March. The rise   in stocks was in line with shipments, and the ratio of stocks to   shipments stayed at a very low level. In April (latest available   data), wholesale inventories retraced most of the sizable March   drawdown. The ratio of inventories to sales in this sector remained   below the range that has prevailed in recent years. At the retail   level, inventory stocks again edged higher; the inventory-to-sales   ratio for this sector was well within the range observed over the past   year.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services   widened in April but was little changed from the average for the first   quarter; over the first four months of 1994, the deficit was   significantly larger than that recorded in the fourth quarter of last   year. The value of exports of goods and services was down somewhat in   April, retracing part of a sharp runup in March. The uptrend in   exports since last fall has been led by shipments of machinery,   especially to expanding markets in Asia. The value of imports of   goods and services was about the same in April as in March; increases   in consumer goods, machinery, and oil were offset by declines in other   categories. The economies of all the major foreign industrial   countries expanded in the first quarter of 1994. Growth resumed in   Japan, western Germany, and France, while economic expansion continued   at a healthy pace in the United Kingdom and Canada.Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had risen   moderately through the first five months of the year. In May, the   rise in the overall index of consumer prices continued to be held down   by declines in energy prices. Excluding the food and energy   components, the increase in consumer prices in the twelve months   ending in May was smaller than that for the previous twelve months.   Producer prices of finished goods continued to edge lower in May,   reflecting further declines in prices of finished foods and energy   goods. Producer prices for items other than food and energy increased   at a faster rate in May, but the change over the twelve-month period   ending in May was very small. At an earlier stage of processing,   producer prices of crude materials other than food and energy   registered another small decline in May, although the index was   substantially higher in May than a year ago. Furthermore, prices of   many basic industrial materials had remained under upward pressure.   Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers   increased by a larger amount in May than in April, but the rise over   the twelve months ended in May was about the same as in the previous   twelve months.At its meeting on May 17, 1994, the Committee adopted a   directive that called for increasing somewhat the degree of pressure   on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the   discount rate. The directive did not include a presumption about the   likely direction of any further adjustment to policy during the   intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the   Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable   economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,   financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly   lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting   period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were   expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and M3 over coming   months.Immediately after the conclusion of the May meeting, the   Board of Governors approved a 1/2 percentage point increase in the   discount rate, to 3-1/2 percent, and the Committee permitted the full   amount of the increase to pass through to interest rates in reserve   markets. Thereafter, open market operations were conducted with a   view to maintaining the less accommodative degree of reserve pressure   sought by the Committee. After the policy change, the federal funds   rate rose 1/2 percentage point, to 4-1/4 percent, and remained at   about that level over the intermeeting period. Adjustment plus   seasonal borrowing trended higher over the intermeeting period,   reflecting the usual seasonal pickup in lending activity, and averaged   close to anticipated levels.Market interest rates on instruments with more than three-month maturities moved lower immediately following the announcement of   the Committee's action, although some very short-term interest rates   moved up. The commercial bank prime rate also was raised by 1/2   percentage point, to 7-1/4 percent. Market participants apparently   interpreted the policy actions and the accompanying announcement as   signaling that the System would not take further tightening actions as   soon as they had anticipated earlier. Incoming data suggesting   sluggish spending and subdued inflation tended to confirm these market   assessments. Late in the intermeeting period, however, bond yields   retraced these declines, partly in association with a weakening dollar   in foreign exchange markets and rising commodity prices. Most major   indexes of equity prices rose early in the intermeeting period, but   they then moved lower in sympathy with the declines in bond prices and   the dollar and ended the period with small losses.The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other   G-10 currencies fell significantly further on balance over the   intermeeting period. The renewed decline, which began toward the   middle of June, occurred in response to indications of an improved   economic outlook abroad, associated increases in foreign bond yields,   and heightened concerns about possible increases in U.S. inflation.   Developments suggesting less favorable prospects for progress in U.S.   Japanese trade negotiations also tended to strengthen the yen against   the dollar.The broad monetary aggregates were weaker than the Committee   anticipated at the time of its previous meeting, with both M2 and M3   declining on average over May and June. The declines appeared to be   related in part to the continuing appeal of capital market   instruments. More generally, however, the rise in short-and long-term interest rates since the beginning of 1994, coupled with the   reluctance of banks and other depository institutions to adjust their   offering rates promptly, had produced a widening of the opportunity   costs of holding deposits and had led households to move deposit   monies into direct and indirect holdings of market instruments. For   the year through June, both M2 and M3 were at the bottom of the   Committee's ranges for 1994, and total domestic nonfinancial debt had   expanded at a moderate rate in the lower half of its monitoring range.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that   the economy was operating at a level close to capacity and that the   expansion would slow over the next several quarters to a rate   generally in line with the growth of the economy's potential. To the   extent that aggregate demand tended to expand at a pace that could   foster higher inflation, it would not be accommodated by monetary   policy, and pressures would be generated in financial markets that   would restrain domestic spending. Consumer spending, which had been   increasing faster than household income for some time, was expected to   moderate as smaller gains in employment and income, coupled with   higher interest rates and reductions in the value of household   financial assets, exerted a restraining influence on consumption   patterns. Business fixed investment was projected to continue at a   brisk pace, although growth would be damped somewhat by the expected   deceleration in economic activity, a growing shortfall of corporate   cash flow relative to capital outlays, and higher financing costs.   The effects of higher mortgage interest rates were expected to cause   some slowing in the relatively robust pace of single-family   homebuilding. The restraint on output growth exerted by weak export   demand was expected to diminish because of the lower value of the   dollar and the somewhat faster recovery now projected in economic   activity abroad. The staff analysis suggested that, with the economy   already operating close to its long-run potential, no further   reduction in the core rate of inflation was likely over the forecast   horizon.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective   economic developments, members commented that the expansion continued   to display considerable momentum, with business activity apparently   still increasing at a pace above the economy's long-run growth   potential. At the same time, indications of some slowing in aggregate   demand had tended to increase over the last few months. The extent of   that slowing remained subject to considerable uncertainty, especially   in light of somewhat disparate data on employment and spending.   Nonetheless, it was generally agreed that, in the context of   appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, some moderation in economic   growth to a pace closer to that of the economy's long-run potential   was a reasonable expectation. Such a slowing seemed necessary to   forestall a buildup of inflation pressures in the view of many   members. A number of members emphasized that remaining margins of   unemployed labor and other production resources, while difficult to   assess, now appeared to be quite limited. Although views differed to   some degree, the members generally concluded that the various factors   affecting the course of inflation were likely to result, on balance,   in little change, or perhaps a small rise, in inflation over the 1994-1995 forecast horizon. Some members regarded the risks of a   significant divergence from their forecasts of economic growth and   inflation as fairly evenly balanced in either direction, but most   believed that those risks were tilted to the upside.In keeping with the usual practice at meetings when the   Committee considers its long-run objectives for growth of the money   and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal   Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided   specific individual projections of growth in real and nominal GDP, the   rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1994 and   1995. The central tendency of the forecasts of the rate of expansion   in real GDP for 1994 as a whole was 3 to 3-1/4 percent, a little below   the rate of growth estimated for the first half of the year; for 1995,   the projections had a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent.   With regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the forecasts centered on   growth rates of 5-1/2 to 6 percent for 1994 and 5 to 5-1/2 percent for   1995. The projections of more moderate growth in economic activity   were associated with rates of unemployment in a range of 6 to 6-1/4   percent in the fourth quarters of both 1994 and 1995, about the same   as the average unemployment rate in recent months. For the rate of   inflation, as measured by the CPI, the projections had a central   tendency of 2-3/4 to 3 percent for 1994 and 2-3/4 to 3-1/2 percent for   1995; both ranges represented a slight increase from the average rate   over the past year. Favorable developments in the food and energy   sectors, which had held down overall inflation measures over the past   several quarters, were not expected to continue and the drop in the   dollar would be exerting upward pressures on prices in coming   quarters.Pursuant to a request from the Chairman of the Senate Banking   Committee, the members considered extending their specific forecasts   by an additional year. Many expressed reservations about the   reliability and thus the usefulness of numerical forecasts extending   relatively far into the future. Moreover, they were concerned about   misunderstandings of specific long-range forecasts in relation to the   Committee's goals and the ongoing formulation of monetary policy. The   members concluded that, on balance, the Committee's policy intentions   and expectations would be conveyed more effectively by the Chairman in   his upcoming Congressional testimony through a discussion of the   important factors bearing on trends in economic growth, prices, and   unemployment; the uncertainties involved in projecting such variables;   and the role of monetary policy in achieving desired economic goals.   In the course of their discussion, Committee members noted that the   Administration's medium-term outlook contained reasonable estimates of   the trend growth in output.In their review of developments in different parts of the   country and sectors of the economy, members referred to indications of   continuing growth in regional business activity ranging from   relatively modest to quite robust across much of the nation; at the   same time, some areas such as California continued to experience   generally stagnant economic conditions. While solid growth seemed to   characterize the overall economy, the members saw increasing signs of   some slowing in many areas. Business and consumer sentiment generally   remained quite positive, although a number of members commented on a   new note of caution among some of their business contacts and some   shaving of industry forecasts for the balance of the year.Turning to the key consumer sector, members commented on   various indications of some moderation in the growth of expenditures.   Higher interest costs were cited by some business contacts as   constraining purchases of consumer durables, but members also referred   to the negative impact of persisting, highly visible cutbacks in   workforces by some major business firms and of growing consumer debt.   Some members also noted that supply constraints, such as limitations   on the availability of some popular automobile models, had tended to   curb the expansion in sales. Looking ahead, more moderate growth in   consumer spending seemed likely; apart from the direct effects of   higher interest rates on such spending, the prospectively less   ebullient housing sector was likely to retard demands for household   furnishings.Business fixed investment was thought likely to continue to   provide appreciable stimulus to the expansion, though to a diminishing   extent in the context of slower overall growth in economic activity   and higher financing costs. While spending for equipment was likely   to moderate considerably from the extraordinarily rapid increases   recorded over an extended period, ongoing business efforts to improve   operating efficiencies would probably sustain substantial further   growth in equipment outlays. Nonresidential construction expenditures   were expected to post moderate increases after stagnating earlier; in   this connection, a number of members observed that commercial vacancy   rates were declining in various metropolitan areas and improved demand   for space was likely to generate increased construction activity.   Although higher interest costs could have some restraining effect,   financing for such projects was more readily available than earlier.   The outlook for inventory investment remained uncertain. Some buildup   in inventories was occurring, but business firms were continuing to   resist sizable increases and inventory-to-sales ratios remained at   unusually low levels. Developments that might be expected to foster a   faster buildup, such as some lengthening of order lead times and   rising pressures on capacity in some industries, had not led to the   strengthening in inventory investment that had characterized   comparable stages of previous business cycle expansions.Members observed that the outlook for exports appeared to   have improved and that foreign trade, on net, probably would make a   small contribution to economic growth over the next several quarters.   Some noted that business contacts were reporting strong foreign demand   for various U.S. products. As members had noted at previous meetings,   the North American Free Trade Agreement appeared to have stimulated   increased trade between Mexico and the United States, although it was   still too early to gauge the extent of this development. More   generally, the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and   a somewhat greater strengthening in the economies of major trading   partners than was expected earlier had enhanced the prospects for   appreciable growth in U.S. exports, and in the view of at least some   members that growth might prove to be considerably greater than was   currently projected.Members remarked that uncertainties about remaining margins   of slack in the economy, accentuated by the change in the household   employment survey, and about potential levels of economic activity   over the quarters ahead made it particularly difficult to assess the   outlook for inflation. However, based on what seemed to be reasonable   estimates of resource utilization levels and their own projections   that the rate of economic growth would slow to a pace nearer the   economy's growth potential, the members generally concluded that the   rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, might remain about   unchanged or tilt slightly higher over the forecast horizon. This   conclusion took into account the effects of the decline in the foreign   exchange value of the dollar, the increase in oil prices on world   markets, and the at-least-temporary rise in food prices. Some members   observed that the overall behavior of prices had been somewhat more   favorable than they would have predicted, given the strength of the   expansion and the level of resource utilization. One explanation   could be that increases in overall capacity and productivity stemming   from business restructuring activities and investments in new   equipment and facilities had been greater than expected. Comments   from numerous business contacts around the country continued to   indicate that despite the rising costs of many materials used in the   production process, highly competitive markets rendered it very   difficult or impossible to pass these higher costs through to prices   of finished goods. At the same time, labor compensation increases had   remained subdued despite indications of shortages of some types of   labor in many parts of the country. Exceptions involving sizable wage   increases continued to be cited for some industries, such as   construction and trucking, that were operating at full capacity.   Nonetheless, in the absence of an uptrend thus far in consumer price   inflation and given continuing uncertainties about job prospects   despite large job gains, wage pressures had remained restrained.In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and   Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee   at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth in the monetary and   debt aggregates that it had established in February for 1994 and it   decided on tentative ranges for growth in those aggregates in 1995.   The current ranges set in February for the period from the fourth   quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994 included expansion of   1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. A monitoring range   for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set at 4 to 8   percent for 1994.In the Committee's discussion, which as in the past tended to   focus on M2, all the members indicated that they were in favor of   retaining the current ranges for M2 and M3 for 1994 and extending   those ranges on a provisional basis to 1995. In their evaluation of   appropriate growth ranges for 1994, the members anticipated that the   projected moderation in the expansion of nominal GDP and the   likelihood that funds would continue to be diverted from deposits to   higher yielding market instruments would be reflected in relatively   sluggish growth in M2 and M3 and further increases in their velocity--the ratio of nominal GDP to these monetary measures. In the   circumstances, expected growth in M2 and M3 at rates around the lower   end of their ranges would be consistent with the Committee's overall   objective of fostering financial conditions that would promote   sustainable economic growth and contain pressures on prices. Indeed,   that objective might even imply a shortfall from one or both of the   current ranges, but shortfalls could be tolerated and explained if   they reflected greater-than-expected increases in velocity associated   with an acceptable economic performance. While growth of the broad   monetary aggregates might pick up somewhat next year, it probably   would remain damped relative to income. In light of this prospect,   and of the uncertainties about appropriate monetary growth in 1995,   the Committee decided to carry forward the 1994 ranges, subject to a   review early next year. The Committee noted that the current ranges,   which had been reduced greatly over the years, could be viewed as   long-run benchmarks for monetary growth consistent with maximum   sustainable economic expansion in a noninflationary environment, if   there were a return to more normal velocity behavior. The Committee   recognized that considerable uncertainty about the behavior of   velocity was likely to persist and that a broad range of financial and   economic indicators, in addition to the monetary aggregates, would   need to be monitored in determining the appropriate course for   monetary policy.In their review of the Committee's monitoring range for the   growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt, the members agreed that   the current range for 1994 should be retained. This view took into   account staff projections indicating that the debt aggregate was   likely to grow within its present range this year, albeit the lower   half of that range. Considerable sentiment was expressed, however,   for reducing the debt monitoring range for 1995. Debt growth was   expected to remain relatively subdued in association with projections   of a slower rate of expansion in nominal GDP. Lowering the range   would underscore the Committee's view that rapid debt growth, should   it materialize and be sustained, could have adverse implications for   inflation and financial stability. Members emphasized, however, that   action to adjust the debt range did not imply increased Committee   emphasis on the debt aggregate, and most believed that the risks of   any misinterpretation could be minimized by including an appropriate   explanation in the report to Congress.At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to   reaffirm the ranges for growth of M2 and M3 and the monitoring range   for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt that it had established   in February for 1994. The following statement was approved for   inclusion in the Committee's domestic policy directive:The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary     and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In     furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established     in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent     and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the     fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994.     The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist     during the year and that money growth within these     ranges would be consistent with its broad policy     objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total     domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8     percent for the year.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,     McDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan,     Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.Votes against this action: None.For the year 1995, the Committee approved provisional ranges   for M2 and M3 that were unchanged from the 1994 ranges. The Committee   reduced the monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial   debt by one percentage point from 1994 to a range of 3 to 7 percent.   Accordingly, the Committee voted to incorporate the following   statement regarding the 1995 ranges in its domestic policy directive:For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative     ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth     quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to     5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The     Committee provisionally set the associated monitoring     range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to     7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the monetary     aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light     of progress toward price level stability, movements in     their velocities, and developments in the economy and     financial markets.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,     McDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan,     Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.Votes against this action: None.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting   period ahead, most members endorsed a proposal to maintain an   unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The economy seemed   to be slowing, although to an uncertain extent. Earlier policy   tightening actions were being reflected in the sluggish behavior of   money and reserves, although the extent of their effects on spending   were still in question. Inflation was a concern, but direct evidence   of additional pressures on costs and prices was quite fragmentary. In   these circumstances, all but one of the members concluded that it   would be prudent for the Committee to assess further developments   before taking any action. One member believed that prompt further   tightening was needed to avert the development of greater inflation.In the discussion of the near-term course of policy, the   members took account of the substantial weakness of the dollar in   foreign exchange markets over the course of recent weeks. By itself,   the drop in the dollar could put some pressure on resources and   prices. However, the members agreed that these effects needed to be   considered in the context of overall prospects for the economy and   financial markets, and policy should not be focused narrowly on the   dollar alone. In any case, given the negative sentiment in the   foreign exchange markets, the effects on the dollar that would flow   from a small change in policy were uncertain. Ultimately, the most   effective support that monetary policy could provide for the dollar   was to foster the objectives of sustainable economic growth and   progress toward price stability.With regard to possible changes in policy during the   intermeeting period, a majority favored a change in the intermeeting   instruction in the directive from symmetry to asymmetry toward   restraint. Some of the members indicated that near-term developments   were not likely to call for an adjustment to policy. Nonetheless, the   risk of inflationary momentum in the expansion remained high, given an   economy that appeared to be operating at or very close to full   capacity, and they believed that the probable direction of the next   policy move was likely to be in the direction of restraint. Some   emphasized that such a move should be made promptly in response to   information suggesting a greater potential for inflation. In the view   of many, though not all, members the costs of policy errors were   asymmetrical at this point. The costs of reversing a policy stance   that turned out to be slightly too tight would be limited to somewhat   slower economic growth for a time; the expansion appeared to be so   well established at this juncture that the risks of a greater economic   adjustment were remote. On the other hand, a policy that turned out   to be unduly stimulative would foster greater inflation and   inflationary expectations that probably could be reversed only at the   cost of considerable disruption in financial markets and the economy.   It also was noted that an asymmetric directive would underscore the   Committee's determination to resist greater inflation; the asymmetry   could be viewed as a logical extension of the strategy adopted in   February to move to a policy stance consistent with averting   inflationary pressures in a firmly established expansion.Some members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric   directive. These members did not rule out the possible need for   further policy tightening, but they believed that the risks   surrounding current forecasts were about evenly weighted in both   directions. One member expressed strong reservations about the use of   an asymmetric directive on the grounds that such language made   intermeeting changes more likely and in the view of that member   markets reacted more favorably when actions were taken and announced   at regular meetings. However, all those favoring a symmetric   directive with an unchanged policy stance could accept an asymmetric   intermeeting instruction.At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one   of the members indicated that they could support a directive that   called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve   positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of   reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in   the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability   and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to   economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided   that slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or   slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the   intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this   meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in the   broader monetary aggregates over coming months.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of   New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by   the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in   accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests     that economic activity recorded another substantial     gain in the second quarter, causing levels of resource     utilization to rise further. Increases in nonfarm     payroll employment have been relatively large on     average in recent months; the civilian unemployment     rate is reported to have declined to 6.0 percent in     May. The rise in industrial production slackened in     April and May, primarily because capacity constraints     prevented normal seasonal increases in the production     of motor vehicles. Growth in consumer spending has     slowed in recent months after very large increases in     February and March. Housing starts have rebounded from     winter disruptions to a pace close to the elevated     fourth-quarter level. Orders for nondefense capital     goods point to a continued strong uptrend in spending     on business equipment, while nonresidential construction has recovered from a weather-depressed level in     the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade     in goods and services was larger in April than in March     but about unchanged from the average for the first     quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and     producer prices have remained moderate in recent     months, though prices of many basic industrial     materials have risen.On May 17, 1994, the Board of Governors approved     an increase in the discount rate from 3 to 3-1/2     percent. Most market interest rates were up slightly     on balance since the May meeting; declines in bond     yields early in the intermeeting period were offset     later by market reactions to a weakening dollar in     foreign exchange markets and rising commodity prices.     The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the     other G-10 currencies was down significantly further on     balance over the intermeeting period, reflecting a     sizable drop since early June.M2 and M3 declined on average over May and June;     for the year through June, both M2 and M3 are at the     bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic     nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate     rate in recent months.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary     and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In     furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established     in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent     and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the     fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994.     The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist     during the year and that money growth within these     ranges would be consistent with its broad policy     objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total     domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8     percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed     on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from     the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of     1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for     M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated     monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial     debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the     monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in     the light of progress toward price level stability,     movements in their velocities, and developments in the     economy and financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate     future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing     degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the     context of the Committee's long-run objectives for     price stability and sustainable economic growth, and     giving careful consideration to economic, financial,     and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve     restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint     might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The     contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be     consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming     months.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,     McDonough, Blinder, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley,     LaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.Votes against this action: Mr. Broaddus.Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that additional   near-term tightening was necessary to contain inflation. The   tightening actions implemented thus far this year were moderate by   historical standards, and he doubted that they would prove sufficient   to prevent higher inflation given the strength of the economic   expansion, the minimal remaining margins of unemployed labor and other   producer resources, and inflationary expectations that he feared might   already be rising.Prior to the conclusion of this meeting, the members   discussed the desirability of announcing the outcome of a meeting when   no action to change policy was taken. Views differed on this issue,   but most of the members supported a proposal to provide a brief and   informal indication that the meeting had ended and that there would be   no further announcements. Since early February, a statement had been   released after each meeting, all of which had involved policy changes;   failure to take some step after this meeting to make clear that there   was no change to announce would lead for a time to a heightened degree   of uncertainty. With regard to future announcements, it was   understood that this issue along with other public disclosure   questions would be considered at a later meeting. The Committee's   decision regarding announcements would then be made public.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be   held on Tuesday, August 16, 1994.The meeting adjourned at 12:35 p.m.Donald L.

There were no System open market transactions in foreign currencies   during this period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments   in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions   in government securities and federal agency obligations during the   period July 6, 1994, through August 15, 1994. By unanimous vote, the   Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and   financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the   intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial   information available at the time of the meeting and of the   Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic   policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the   Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the   pace of economic expansion, though still substantial, might have   slowed somewhat recently. Consumer spending continued to post   moderate gains, supported by rising labor income and favorable   sentiment. Business outlays for plant and equipment remained on a   steep uptrend, but higher interest rates seemed to be having some   restraining effect on homebuilding activity. Resource utilization was   at elevated levels, with factories operating at relatively high rates   and labor markets evidencing very low levels of slack. Increases in   broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had remained moderate in   recent months, apart from the effects of short-run swings in the   volatile food and energy components.Nonfarm payroll employment continued to advance at a robust   pace in July. Hiring in the services industries remained strong, with   personnel supply agencies posting another sizable increase. Jobs also   were up substantially in retail trade and construction. By contrast,   employment in manufacturing was held down by strike activity. The   civilian unemployment rate edged up to 6.1 percent in July, little   changed from the average for the second quarter.Industrial production rose moderately in July after a sizable   gain in June; a decline in electricity generation from its unusually   high weather-related level in June damped the July advance.   Manufacturing output was up considerably in July, despite a drop in   the production of motor vehicles and parts; outside of motor vehicles,   increases were widespread, with a very large rise recorded in the   output of durable consumer goods. The overall rate of capacity   utilization in manufacturing remained at a high level, with most major   industry groups operating at or near capacity.Growth in consumer spending had slowed in recent months,   owing in part to constraints on the supply of motor vehicles. Nominal   retail sales edged lower in July after expanding at a slightly reduced   pace in the second quarter. Sales at general merchandise and   furniture and appliance stores increased further in July, while   purchases at apparel outlets were down after large June increases.   Sales at automotive dealerships fell appreciably in July after edging   lower in the second quarter; these sales declines apparently resulted   in part from the inability of manufacturers to produce enough of the   most popular models. Housing starts in July retraced part of a large   June decline but remained below their elevated rate in the fourth   quarter of 1993.Business fixed investment expanded in the second quarter at   about the same brisk pace as in the first quarter but well below the   rate recorded in 1993. In the second quarter, a strong recovery in   nonresidential construction activity from the weather-related decline   of the first quarter offset a marked slowing in business purchases of   durable equipment. Much of the slowdown in the growth of outlays for   equipment reflected a reduction in the pace of acquisition of office   and computing equipment. Other categories of durable equipment, with   the exception of aircraft and motor vehicles, continued to show solid   increases. Most indicators of business investment activity suggested   further large gains in coming months: Orders for nondefense capital   goods pointed to a continued strong expansion in spending on business   equipment, and permits for nonresidential construction had been rising   as well.Business inventory investment slowed in June after a sharp   acceleration in April and May; for the second quarter as a whole,   inventories were up substantially but they appeared to have remained   broadly in line with sales. In manufacturing, recent inventory   buildups had been concentrated in a few industries where orders had   been particularly strong. For manufacturing as a whole, the ratio of   stocks to shipments declined from an already low level. At the   wholesale level, the accumulation of inventories in the second quarter   was largely in durable goods, which were in strong demand; the   inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained below the range that   has prevailed in recent years. A large part of the buildup of retail   inventories in the second quarter was in nondurable goods, especially   in stocks of general merchandise. For the retail sector as a whole,   the inventory-to-sales ratio at the end of June was near the high end   of the range observed in recent years.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services   widened slightly in May; for April and May combined, the deficit was   significantly larger than in the first quarter. Exports of goods and   services were about the same in May as in April, with increased   shipments of machinery and industrial supplies offset by reduced   exports of aircraft and gold. Imports of goods and services were   slightly higher in May than in April. Most of the increase was in   imports of oil, as a consequence of higher prices, and consumer goods.   The economies of all the major foreign industrial countries continued   to expand in the second quarter. Growth remained at a healthy pace in   the United Kingdom and Canada and appeared to have firmed in   continental Europe. In Japan, growth apparently slowed somewhat in   the second quarter.Trends in broad measures of prices and labor costs had shown   no change thus far in 1994. In July, the overall index of consumer   prices rose at the same pace as in June, despite larger monthly   increases in the food and energy components of the index. The jump in   energy prices reflected the effects of the earlier run-up in crude oil   prices. For the twelve months ended in July, both the overall index   and the index excluding food and energy rose by about the same amounts   as during the preceding twelve-month period. At the producer level,   prices of finished goods were up significantly in July after no change   in June; large price increases were recorded for coffee and finished   energy goods. Prices of finished goods other than food and energy   were unchanged on balance over June and July and registered only a   small rise over the twelve months ended in July. At an earlier stage   of processing, producer prices of intermediate materials posted   another sizable gain in July. These prices had increased at a faster   rate thus far this year than in 1993, mirroring a similar pattern in   prices of nonfood, non-energy crude materials. The employment cost   index for private industry workers rose more rapidly in the second   quarter after a sharp slowing in the first quarter, with the   acceleration in compensation largely reflecting a pickup in wage and   salary growth. The increase in total compensation over the last four   quarters was little changed from the advance over the previous four-quarter period.At its meeting on July 5-6, 1994, the Committee adopted a   directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure   on reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible   firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The   directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run   objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and   giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary   developments, slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable   or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the   intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this   directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and   M3 over coming months.Open market operations during the intermeeting period were   directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve   positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing rose over the period in   accommodation of the usual summer pickup in demands for seasonal   credit and averaged near anticipated levels. The federal funds rate   remained close to 4-1/4 percent.Other market interest rates were unchanged to up slightly on   balance over the intermeeting period. Rates generally edged lower   during the early part of the period as incoming data were viewed by   market participants as being consistent with continued moderation in   final demands and a reduced need for any further monetary tightening   actions. In early August, however, interest rates began to erase   their previous declines, partly in response to the strong employment   report, which generated expectations that monetary policy might need   to be tightened substantially in the near term. Most major indexes of   equity prices were up on balance over the intermeeting period, with   second-quarter corporate profits generally better than had been   expected.The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other   G-10 currencies declined early in the intermeeting period but later   recouped its losses and ended the period unchanged on balance. The   fluctuations in the dollar partly reflected evolving perceptions of   the degree to which U.S. authorities were concerned about further   weakness in the currency. Over the intermeeting period, the dollar   depreciated slightly against the mark but edged higher against the   yen.Both M2 and M3 expanded in July after declining on average   over May and June. The growth of M2 in July owed in part to a sizable   increase in liquid deposits, but in light of a resumption of run-offs   at bond mutual funds it also may have reflected a renewed preference   by households for the protection of principal provided by money market   mutual funds. The strength in M2 showed through to M3, which also was   boosted by funds garnered from wholesale sources to finance a surge in   bank credit. For the year through July, M2 and M3 grew at rates   slightly above the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic   nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate pace.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that   the economy was operating close to its long-run capacity and that   growth would trend lower over the next several quarters to a rate   generally in line with the increase in its potential. Under these   circumstances, trends in the core rate of inflation would not deviate   significantly from recent experience, but there was a risk that such   an outcome might require further monetary policy tightening. Growth   in consumer spending was projected to slow in response to smaller   gains in employment and income, some reductions in pent-up demands,   and the adverse effects on household financial wealth of earlier   increases in interest rates and declines in stock market prices.   Business fixed investment, while remaining relatively brisk, was   expected to decelerate somewhat over the forecast horizon, primarily   owing to smaller projected gains in sales, a growing shortfall of   corporate cash flow relative to capital outlays, and higher financing   costs. Single-family housing construction would continue to be damped   by the higher mortgage rates; however, the pace of homebuilding was   expected to remain relatively robust compared with the rate of recent   years, reflecting still unsatisfied demand for homeownership and the   relatively favorable cash-flow affordability of housing, as judged by   the standards of the past two decades. The restraint on economic   activity exerted by weak export demand was projected to diminish as   economic conditions improved abroad, given the competitiveness of U.S.   produced goods.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective   economic developments, members commented that final aggregate demand   appeared to have slowed somewhat in recent months but that the   expansion still seemed to have considerable underlying momentum.   Indeed, available data on the various components of spending taken   together might in fact be understating the growth in economic   activity; the strength of labor markets and measures of gross domestic   income suggested a somewhat stronger economic performance. Sustained   expansion, perhaps at a pace broadly in line with or a bit above the   economy's long-run growth potential, remained a reasonable   expectation, but many members observed that they saw the risks as   being on the upside of such a projection in the absence of some   further policy tightening. Views varied to some degree with regard to   available margins of unemployed resources, but the members agreed that   the economy probably was operating very close to, and in the view of   some might have reached, its long-run potential. In these   circumstances, the members saw appreciable risks of intensifying   pressures on resources and higher inflation. Broad measures of wages   and prices suggested little change in inflation trends in recent   quarters, but worrisome signs of greater inflation were evident in the   prices of materials purchased by business firms and in anecdotal   reports of successful efforts by an increasing number of businesses to   pass on rising costs by raising prices.In their comments on business conditions in different parts   of the nation, members reported continuing expansion ranging from   modest to solid growth in most regions, However, the rise in business   activity appeared to have slowed in some areas and business conditions   had remained essentially unchanged in a number of others, notably in   California. In the course of their review, members pointed to the   general strength in labor markets as evidenced, for example, by   statistical indications of large and persisting gains in employment   and relatively low initial claims for unemployment compensation.   These data for the national economy were reinforced by reports of   sizable employment increases in numerous industries and parts of the   country and associated indications of growing labor shortages in a   number of areas and some occupations.The financial climate remained supportive of sustained   economic growth. It was clear that the rise in interest rates since   the start of the year had had some restraining effects on interest-sensitive expenditures, notably housing and perhaps to a lesser extent   some consumer durables, but to date these effects had not been large.   Moreover, surveys and anecdotal reports suggested that banking   institutions were becoming increasingly aggressive in their efforts to   foster loan growth by easing many terms and standards for lending. In   financial markets more generally, risk spreads had remained relatively   narrow and both debt and equity markets appeared to be well positioned   to provide ample financing for further economic expansion.In their review of developments in key sectors of the   economy, members saw widespread evidence of a well established   expansion. Some signs of moderation from the rapid advance in recent   quarters had emerged, including statistical and anecdotal indications   of somewhat slower growth of consumer spending. Members noted,   however, that an apparently significant portion of the recent weakness   in sales of motor vehicles appeared to be related to supply shortages   that were in the process of being corrected. Consumer confidence   remained at a high level and likely reflected, among other factors,   the strength in job markets in many parts of the country. Nonetheless, more moderate consumer spending was a reasonable expectation   in the context of a low saving rate, increased consumer debt levels,   and higher interest rates. One member commented that some pause in   the expansion of overall consumer spending would not be unusual after   several quarters of robust growth, and another remarked that the rise   in household expenditures had been larger than the increase in   household cash incomes by an appreciable margin over the past year.Further marked expansion in business-fixed investment was   likely to make a sizable contribution to continuing economic growth.   Ongoing strength in orders, including foreign demand, pointed to rapid   further growth in expenditures for business equipment over coming   months. Some moderation in the growth of such spending appeared   likely later in the context of projected slower expansion in sales and   the rise in financing costs. The outlook for nonresidential   construction, while not ebullient, nonetheless seemed likely to become   a more positive factor in fostering further economic growth. Demand   for commercial real estate space, including office space, had begun to   improve in many areas. Against this background and given the apparent   availability of financing for soundly based projects, nonresidential   construction activity, while displaying considerable local variation,   appeared to be on a moderate uptrend for the nation as a whole.Prospective developments in foreign trade also were expected   to have a positive effect on the expansion of the domestic economy and   indeed to offset some of the anticipated slowing in the overall growth   of domestic demand. Economic conditions abroad were improving faster   than had been anticipated, and this development along with the decline   in the foreign exchange value of the dollar was projected to stimulate   faster growth in exports while curbing that of imports over the next   several quarters.Members focused on recent inventory developments, which in   the context of some moderation in the growth of final demand had   accounted for a considerable portion of the overall expansion in GDP   reported for the second quarter. While the rate of inventory   accumulation could be expected to slow in the current quarter, the   extent of that slowing and its retarding effects on near-term economic   growth were uncertain. Partly on the basis of anecdotal reports, the   members concluded that much of the inventory buildup in the second   quarter was voluntary, thereby reducing the probability of a sharp   reversal. Indeed, to the degree that delivery lead times might edge   up in various industries as capacity constraints were encountered,   stronger efforts to build inventories could emerge, especially against   the background of currently low inventory-to-sales ratios. Some   business contacts reported that they were planning to add to their   inventories over the months ahead. At the same time, ongoing business   efforts to maintain relatively lean inventories undoubtedly would tend   to limit any broad buildup in inventories.With regard to the outlook for residential construction,   members reported some slowing in single-family housing demand in many   parts of the country as homebuyers reacted to the rise in mortgage   interest rates. However, single-family homebuilding activity was   being maintained at relatively robust levels in some areas and   multifamily housing construction was improving in numerous local   markets. On balance, the housing sector probably would contribute   little, if any, impetus to the expansion but homebuilding was likely   to remain well above its earlier depressed levels.In their assessment of the outlook for inflation, many   members focused on the prospects for further growth in output in the   context of diminishing margins of unemployed production resources.   It was difficult to assess the extent of remaining margins of   available resources, in part because of uncertainty about the effects   on capacity of ongoing efforts to improve productivity through   business restructurings and sharp increases in business investment   expenditures. Despite somewhat differing views, the members generally   concluded that the economy probably was operating at a level that was   quite close to, if not already at, its long-run potential. In the   circumstances, many of the members commented that the risks of   intensifying inflation clearly were on the upside if the economic   expansion did not moderate from its pace in recent quarters.   Indications of accelerating cost and price pressures were not yet   visible in broad measures of inflation and wages. Those measures,   while subject to fluctuations largely associated with swings in food   and energy prices, had not displayed any discernible trend over the   past several quarters. At the same time, signs of increasing prices   and costs at earlier stages of production appeared to be multiplying,   including sizable price increases for a wide range of industrial   commodities. More generally, members cited a growing number of   reports by business firms of rising input costs and of more successful   efforts by some firms to raise prices. It also was noted that the   decline in the value of the dollar would contribute, directly and   indirectly, to some upward pressures on prices. However, business   contacts, notably at the retail level, indicated that competition   remained intense and made it very difficult to pass on cost increases   through higher prices, thereby placing a premium on continued efforts   to contain costs through improvements in productivity. From a   differing perspective, one member noted that decelerating growth in   money measures such as Ml, the monetary base, and reserves--which had   been expanding rapidly for several years--implied that monetary policy   had been moved substantially to curtail any increase in inflation   pressures, though more action might still be required.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting   period ahead, the members agreed that a prompt further tightening move   was needed to provide greater assurance that inflationary pressures in   the economy would remain subdued. The members recognized that the   Committee's earlier policy actions were exerting some restraining   effects and that further lagged effects from those actions could be   expected. Even so, the underlying strength in demand and narrow   margins of slack in the economy pointed to a considerable risk of   further inflation pressures in the absence of additional policy   tightening.With regard to the size of the policy adjustment, the members   were apprised of a disposition on the part of the Board of Governors   to approve the 1/2 percentage point increase in the discount rate that   was pending at several Federal Reserve Banks. The Committee members   endorsed a proposal to allow the effects of such a rise in the   discount rate, should it be approved, to be reflected fully in reserve   markets. Consideration was given to a lesser adjustment in reserve   conditions, but the members concluded that a smaller step was unlikely   to be adequate, and on perceiving this, financial markets would   quickly build in further monetary tightening, the unknown size and   timing of which would add to market uncertainty and volatility. A   more decisive policy move might reduce the need for further tightening   later, or possibly even avert that need entirely, by moderating or   arresting the inflationary momentum in the economy more promptly and   by helping to curb inflationary expectations more effectively.In considering possible adjustments to policy during the   period before the next meeting, all the members favored moving to a   symmetric intermeeting instruction. Such a directive would be   consistent with the members' expectations that a further policy action   was not likely to be needed for some time, given the substantial   nature of today's policy move. However, a symmetrical directive would   not rule out the possibility of a policy move in the event that   intermeeting developments differed substantially from expectations.At the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all   the members indicated they could support a directive that called for   increasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions,   taking account of a possible increase in the discount rate, and that   did not include a presumption about possible adjustments to policy   during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the   Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable   economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,   financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that   slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be   acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff   analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be   consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of   New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by   the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in   accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests     that the pace of economic expansion, though still     substantial, may have moderated somewhat recently,     while resource utilization has remained at high levels.     Nonfarm payroll employment continued to advance at a     robust pace in July, but the civilian unemployment rate     edged up to 6.1 percent--about the same as the average     for the second quarter. Industrial production rose     appreciably over June and July. Growth in consumer     spending has slowed in recent months, owing in part to     constraints on the supply of motor vehicles. Housing     starts rose in July. Orders for nondefense capital     goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending     on business equipment; permits for nonresidential     construction have been rising as well. Business     inventories registered a large increase in the second     quarter, but inventories appeared to have remained     broadly in line with sales. The average nominal     deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was larger     in April and May than the average for the first     quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and     producer prices have remained moderate in recent     months, apart from the effect of short-run swings in     volatile food and energy components.Most market interest rates are unchanged to up     slightly on balance since the July meeting. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10     currencies was unchanged on balance over the inter-meeting period.M2 and M3 turned up in July following declines on     average in both aggregates over May and June; for the     year through July, M2 and M3 grew at rates slightly     above the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total     domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at     a moderate rate in recent months.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary     and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In     furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its     meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5     percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from     the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of     1994. The Committee anticipated that developments     contributing to unusual velocity increases could     persist during the year and that money growth within     these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy     objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total     domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8     percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed     on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from     the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of     1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for     M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated     monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial     debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the     monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in     the light of progress toward price level stability,     movements in their velocities, and developments in the     economy and financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate     future, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the     existing degree of pressure on reserve positions,     taking account of a possible increase in the discount     rate. In the context of the Committee's long-run     objectives for price stability and sustainable economic     growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,     financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater     reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint     would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The     contemplated  reserve conditions are  expected to be      consistent with modest growth in M2  and M3  over coming      months. Votes for this action: Messrs.

Mishkin   as Associate Economist from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to   serve until the next election at the first meeting of the Committee   after December 31, 1994, with the understanding that in the event of   his discontinuance of his official connection with the Federal Reserve   Bank of New York he would cease to have any official connection with   the Federal Open Market Committee.The Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments   in foreign exchange markets during the period since the August   meeting. There were no System open market transactions in foreign   currencies during this period, and thus no vote was required of the   Committee.The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments   in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions   in government securities and federal agency obligations during the   period August 16, 1994, through September 26, 1994. By unanimous   vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and   financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the   intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial   information available at the time of the meeting and of the   Committee\\'s discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic   policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the   Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the   pace of economic expansion remained substantial, though it appeared to   have moderated slightly in recent months. Final sales, especially of   consumer goods, had firmed during the summer months while inventory   investment apparently had slowed after a second-quarter surge.   Manufacturing activity, bolstered by a pickup in production of motor   vehicles, had been rising briskly, and the trend of payroll hiring   remained strong. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer   prices had been somewhat larger in recent months, and prices of   materials had remained under considerable upward pressure.Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably further in   August, though at a somewhat less rapid rate than the average pace in   earlier months of the year. The slowdown in hiring in August was   concentrated in retail trade, where employment was little changed   after large gains in the two prior months, and in construction, where   it fell slightly. In manufacturing, employment was up considerably   after essentially no change in July; while much of the strength was   related to a pickup in the production of motor vehicles, hiring was up   in a number of other industries as well. The average workweek of   production or nonsupervisory workers declined in August from July\\'s   relatively high level, but for the two months combined the average   hours worked was well above the second-quarter level. Both household   employment and the labor force surged in August, and the civilian   unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.1 percent.Industrial production rose sharply in August after sizable   gains in previous months. The August advance reflected a large increase in manufacturing output that was partly offset by declines in   mining production and electricity generation; much of the strength in   manufacturing resulted from a large rise in the output of motor   vehicles stemming from unusually rapid retooling for the new model   year. Elsewhere in manufacturing, production of office and computing   equipment continued to expand briskly, and output of industrial   equipment was up significantly. Total utilization of industrial   capacity rose further in August from already high levels.Consumer spending remained on a solid upward trend. Retail   sales rose considerably in August after holding steady in July. Sales   of goods other than motor vehicles registered sizable increases in   both July and August. Sales of motor vehicles, which had been   constrained in recent months by shortages of popular domestic models,   rebounded in August. Housing starts in July and August averaged   slightly less than their second-quarter rate. Single-family starts   had leveled off in recent months after declining earlier in the year;   multifamily starts, though erratic from month to month, had been   drifting higher.The limited data available for the third quarter suggested   that growth of real business fixed investment, though still strong,   continued to slow from the very rapid pace of 1993. Shipments of   nondefense capital goods declined in July, offsetting much of a large   June advance. However, orders for nondefense capital goods were up   significantly on balance in June and July, pointing to continued brisk   expansion in business spending on durable equipment. Nonresidential   construction activity increased further in July, and permits for such   construction remained on a mild uptrend.The growth in business inventories slowed markedly in July   after surging in the second quarter. The July deceleration reflected   a sizable reduction in retail inventories, principally automotive and   general merchandise stocks. For the retail sector as a whole, the   inventory-to-sales ratio declined sharply in July to about the middle   of the range seen in recent years. At the wholesale level,   inventories increased substantially, both in July and over the second   quarter, and the overall inventory-to-sales ratio edged up in July   toward the middle of the range for this ratio in recent years.   Inventory investment also picked up in manufacturing, where much of   the July accumulation represented stocks of materials, supplies, and   work-in-progress. The run-up in stocks was accompanied by a drop in   factory shipments, and as a result, the inventory-shipments ratio   recorded an unusually steep rise.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services   widened substantially further in July after a large increase in the   second quarter. The value of exports of goods and services slipped in   July from a relatively high level in June, while the value of imports   in July changed little from June. Economic activity in all of the   foreign G-7 industrial countries except Japan expanded rapidly in the   second quarter, and available indicators suggested that strong growth   continued on average in the third quarter. In Japan, activity   contracted in the second quarter, reflecting weakness in consumption   and business investment; the limited data available for the third   quarter suggested that growth in that country might have resumed.Consumer prices rose a little faster in July and August than   their average pace for the first half of the year. The recent pickup   in consumer inflation reflected large increases in energy prices as   well as somewhat higher food prices; excluding the food and energy   components, consumer price advances had remained moderate. Prices   rose briskly at the producer level in July and August as prices of   finished energy goods surged and prices of finished foods turned up   after declining over the first half of the year. For items other than   finished foods and energy, the increase over the July-August period   was a little faster than in the first half of the year. Recent data   indicated little change in wage trends. Average hourly earnings of   production or nonsupervisory workers rose in August at about the rate   observed over the previous twelve months.At its meeting on August 16, 1994, the Committee adopted a   directive that called for increasing somewhat the degree of pressure   on reserve positions, taking account of a possible rise in the   discount rate. The Committee did not include in the directive any   presumption about further adjustments to policy during the   intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the   context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and   sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to   economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater   reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be   acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions   associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with   modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.Immediately after the conclusion of the August meeting, the   Board of Governors approved a 1/2 percentage point increase in the   discount rate to a level of 4 percent. The Committee permitted the   full amount of the increase to pass through to interest rates in the   market for reserves, and the federal funds rate rose about 1/2   percentage point to an average of around 4-3/4 percent. As indicated   in an announcement released on the day of the meeting, the Committee   did not anticipate that further policy tightening was likely to be   needed for a time, given the substantial nature of the policy move.   Accordingly, open market operations over the intermeeting period were   conducted with a view to maintaining the less accommodative degree of   pressure on reserve positions implemented just after the August   meeting, and the federal funds rate remained near 4-3/4 percent. In   accordance with the usual cresting of seasonal demands for discount   credit at this time of the year, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing   rose over much of the period but began to edge lower subsequently.   Borrowing averaged near anticipated levels.Most market interest rates were up somewhat on balance since   the August meeting. Short-term rates, which had risen prior to the   meeting in anticipation of a smaller policy move, increased modestly   further after the Federal Reserve tightened and then changed little   over the next several weeks. Subsequently, however, these rates began   to move higher in response to incoming economic data that were seen as   pointing to the potential for greater inflation in the future and   hence to further firming in reserve conditions. Long-term yields fell   following the policy tightening, but these declines were erased within   a few days, and rates later rose noticeably further in response to the   incoming data. Most major indexes of equity prices were up on balance   over the intermeeting period despite price declines near the end of   the period.The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other   G-10 currencies depreciated somewhat over the intermeeting period.   Bearish sentiment toward the dollar in the foreign exchange markets   appeared to be influenced importantly by continuing concerns about   inflation trends in the United States compared with those in other   major industrial countries.M2 and M3 declined in August after expanding moderately in   July, and data available for September pointed to little further   change in either aggregate. The August decline in M2 reflected   weakness in most of its liquid components that may have been induced   to a considerable extent by the rise, which began early this year, in   the opportunity costs of holding such accounts. The decline in M3 was   associated with a sharp drop in institution-only money funds in   response to the increase in market yields, but the weakness in this   broader aggregate was limited by the brisk issuance of large-denomination time deposits as banks continued to rely on managed   liabilities to fund credit growth. For the year through August, M2   and M3 grew at rates slightly above the lower ends of their respective   ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand   at a moderate rate in recent months.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that   growth in economic activity would slow appreciably over the next   several quarters, dropping briefly below the rate of increase in the   economy\\'s potential output. According to a staff analysis, the   economy already was operating at its long-run capacity, and the   forecast assumed that monetary policy would not accommodate any   continuing tendency for aggregate demand to expand at a pace that   could foster sustained higher inflation. Growth in consumer   expenditures was projected to moderate next year as spending on   consumer durables lost some momentum in the context of diminishing   pent-up demands, the rise in borrowing costs, and smaller gains in   income. After an extended period of very rapid increases, growth in   business fixed investment also was expected to slow appreciably,   partly reflecting less favorable financial conditions and partly the   slower pace of output growth. Homebuilding would be damped by higher   financing costs, though activity in this sector was expected to remain   well above the depressed levels reached in recent years. With the   economy operating close to its long-run potential, no further   reduction in the core rate of inflation was anticipated over the   forecast horizon. Consumer price inflation was projected to be   elevated over the near term--by some pass-through of the ongoing run-up in materials prices and by higher import prices--before settling   down again.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective   economic conditions, members commented on continuing indications of a   robust expansion in business activity, with output near maximum   sustainable levels. They still viewed significant slowing in the pace   of the expansion as a reasonable expectation, though they acknowledged   that signs of such slowing currently were limited and in particular   that the most recent data indicated a greater probability of somewhat   more strength in aggregate demand than had appeared to be developing   during the late spring and early summer. The policy tightening   actions implemented earlier in the year seemed to have elicited only a   mild response thus far in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.   However, much of the retarding effects of those actions, including the   recent sizable tightening in August, probably had not yet been felt in   the economy. In light of the strength of aggregate demand and lags in   the effects of policy, the risks of some rise in inflation rates   probably had increased. How large this rise might be or when it might   be reversed was very difficult to predict at this point. However,   indications of a persisting pickup in inflation would be a matter of   considerable concern, and further developments would need to be   monitored with special care in light of the Committee\\'s longstanding   commitment to containing inflation and moving over time toward price   stability to foster the maximum, sustainable performance of the   economy.In their review of developments across the nation, members   commented on high levels of business activity in many regions and   many of them referred to increasing reports of scarcities of specific   types of labor resources. After softening earlier in many areas,   business conditions appeared to have strengthened in a number of   regions during recent weeks while displaying little change or   continued moderate growth elsewhere. Robust expansion in   manufacturing activity, especially in the motor vehicle and related   industries, was a notable feature of recent business developments. On   the financial side, the overall expansion of credit had remained   moderate, but many members stressed the ready availability of   financing from increasingly aggressive bank lenders. Moreover,   despite higher interest rates, capital markets were providing   continued support to a wide variety of borrowers. The constraints on   the availability of credit and the reluctance of many borrowers to   incur new debt, factors that had tended to retard the recovery during   its earlier stages, had given way to a financial climate that might   even be providing an extra impetus to spending.With regard to the outlook for activity in key sectors of the   economy, consumer spending had been more buoyant than expected over   recent months and members saw such spending as likely to be reasonably   well maintained. Some moderation in its growth over the quarters   ahead seemed likely, however, as pent-up demands increasingly were   satisfied and housing-related purchases of consumer durables tended to   moderate. Members cited anecdotal evidence of fairly brisk retail   sales in many areas recently and associated optimism among retail   business contacts. Recent survey results indicated that consumer   sentiment remained favorable. Sales of motor vehicles were expected   to continue the improvement noted in August as supply shortages were   met through increased production.Business fixed investment was viewed as likely to rise   substantially further over the next several quarters, but the rate of   growth had been moderating this year and probably would diminish   further in conjunction with the projected slowing in overall demand.   The expansion in expenditures for business equipment had slowed   considerably this year from an extremely rapid rate in 1993 and could   be expected to moderate somewhat further. At the same time,   nonresidential construction was slowly trending higher as firms facing   capacity constraints sought to expand their production facilities.The prospects for inventory investment remained a key   uncertainty in the outlook in that developments in this sector could   well have an important bearing on the extent of the anticipated   slowing in the expansion of overall economic activity over the next   few quarters. The surge in inventory investment in the second quarter   clearly was unsustainable, but some members questioned whether the   expected cutback in inventory accumulation would be sizable over the   near term. Continuing strength in new orders and anecdotal reports   did not point to a desire to reduce inventories and suggested that   much of the second-quarter buildup probably had been intended.   Indeed, in the context of increasing backlogs and lagging deliveries   that pointed to growing capacity constraints, many business firms   might seek to build \"safety stocks\" to avoid supply disruptions that   would interfere with production schedules. At the same time, the   trend toward \"just in time\" inventory management--even if temporarily   arrested as safety stocks were increased--would help to limit a   potentially excessive buildup in inventories that would present a   threat later to the sustainability of the expansion.Members cited anecdotal evidence tending to support   statistical indications of some weakening in housing markets and they   generally anticipated that the rise that had occurred in mortgage   interest rates would exert a further damping effect on housing   activity over the year ahead. However, against the background of the   still relatively favorable affordability of housing and the likelihood   of some further pent-up demand, only a moderate drop in overall   homebuilding activity seemed likely.A number of members expressed the view that the external   sector was likely to contribute to the expansion of domestic economic   activity in light of the depreciation in the value of the dollar and   indications of stronger economic growth in foreign industrial nations.   However, relatively rapid expansion in foreign economic activity would   add to pressures on world commodity prices at least for a time. One   member expressed concern about the potential, albeit uncertain,   effects on the exchange value of the dollar of developments unrelated   to the conduct of monetary policy, such as the ongoing trade   negotiations with Japan and forthcoming elections in Germany.In their discussion of various factors bearing on the outlook   for inflation, members noted that some measures of inflation had   picked up recently and that many private forecasters anticipated   higher inflation in 1995 than in 1994. The worsening of inflation   could perhaps be viewed as reflecting increasing capacity constraints   in the face of recent growth in overall demand at a pace above the   economy\\'s long-run potential. From this perspective, the future path   of inflation would depend importantly on the extent to which the   expansion in overall activity would in fact abate from an   unsustainable pace. Some members expressed particular concern that if   above-trend growth did not moderate soon, existing inflationary   pressures and inflationary expectations would quickly become more   pronounced and inflation would gather momentum. Thus far, however,   price pressures remained concentrated in the early stages of   production. As evidenced by broad measures of prices and anecdotal   information obtained from numerous business contacts, the pass-through   of the higher costs of materials to the prices of final goods had been   muted in what business executives continued to describe as highly   competitive markets. The ability of business firms to hold down price   increases in turn reflected to a marked degree their successful   efforts to control unit costs through ongoing gains in productivity.   Moreover, with profit margins currently at high levels, business firms   facing competitive market conditions had some leeway to absorb rising   costs. Increasingly tight labor markets in many parts of the country   had not resulted in higher overall wage inflation, but members   reported some upward pressure on the wages of certain categories of   workers in strong demand. One member expressed the view that   continued moderation in price and wage increases also might reflect in   some measure a shift in price and wage-setting behavior attributable   to the credibility of the Committee\\'s anti-inflationary stance in   recent years. A number of members commented that the sluggish to   moderate growth of a wide variety of money and credit measures   provided some assurance that, to date, monetary policy had not laid   the basis for a sustained upturn in inflation. Nonetheless, the   members concluded that the potential for additional inflation remained   substantial and, from a monetary policy standpoint, rendered   especially urgent the ongoing assessment of inflation trends.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the period ahead,   most of the members agreed on the desirability of maintaining a steady   policy course, at least for the near term. In light of the   appreciable tightening of policy approved in August, the members had   anticipated that no further policy change was likely to be required   for a period, and at this juncture they generally continued to feel   that the recent evidence did not warrant an immediate further   tightening. Even so, the ongoing inflow of information on the   performance of the economy continued to indicate a significant   potential for higher inflation down the road, and for many members   this suggested that additional monetary restraint could well be needed   at some time. A key uncertainty in this regard related to the   restraining effects of the policy moves implemented earlier this year;   these actions appeared to have exerted less restraint to date than had   been anticipated, but appreciable lagged effects from those actions--indeed, perhaps a large part of those effects--could still be   expected. At this time, it was extremely difficult to evaluate   whether the earlier tightening moves were exerting a lesser effect   than usual or it simply was more delayed, or whether the members might   have misjudged the underlying strength of the expansion. In the view   of many members, the information that would become available during   the intermeeting period should provide a firmer basis for judging the   course of the economy and the risks of greater inflation. Should   incoming information point to a greater likelihood that price   pressures would intensify, the Committee would need to act promptly   and forcefully to avert an upward ratcheting of inflationary   expectations and actual inflation that would be difficult to reverse.   Consequently, while views differed with regard to the likely need for   some policy tightening over the weeks immediately ahead, the members   generally supported a shift from the symmetry in the August directive   to asymmetry toward restraint. Some members indicated that they could   accept an asymmetric directive, but they expressed misgivings about   the use of such an instruction in the directive because they felt it   was subject to misunderstanding in financial markets and could add to   uncertainty about Committee intentions. One member favored an   immediate move to somewhat greater reserve restraint because the   available evidence in his view already suggested an upturn in   inflationary expectations and the prospect of a significant rise in   inflation.In the course of the Committee\\'s discussion, a number of   members commented that the behavior of the monetary and credit   aggregates should be taken into account in the evaluation of the   current stance of monetary policy. While various money and related   measures had for many years proved unreliable to a greater or lesser   extent in gauging economic prospects, the weak growth in a wide array   of these measures could not be entirely disregarded as a possible   indicator of the degree of monetary restraint and argued for caution   in implementing any further policy tightening. One member noted,   however, that the slow growth in the narrow measures of reserves and   money followed an extended period of rapid expansion and their recent   weakness might not be indicative of constrained liquidity at this   point. Moreover, the ready availability of bank credit and the   receptivity of financial markets more generally argued that many   borrowers, including small and medium-size businesses, currently had   access to ample financing.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all but one   of the members indicated that they could support a directive that   called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve   positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of   reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in   the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability   and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to   economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided   that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or   slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the   intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this   meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in the   broader monetary aggregates over the balance of the year.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of   New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by   the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in   accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests     that the pace of economic expansion, though perhaps     moderating slightly in recent months, remains substantial. Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably further in August, and the civilian unemployment     rate was unchanged at 6.1 percent. Reflecting strength     in motor vehicles, industrial production rose sharply in     August after posting sizable gains in other recent     months, and capacity utilization moved up further from     already high levels. Retail sales were up considerably     in August, boosted by a rebound in sales of durable     goods, including motor vehicles. Housing starts rose in     August but were unchanged from their second-quarter     level. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a     continued strong expansion in spending on business     equipment; permits for nonresidential construction     remain on a mild uptrend. Inventory accumulation     appears to have moderated recently after surging in the     second quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in     goods and services widened in July from its second-quarter average. Prices of materials have remained     under upward pressure, and increases in broad indexes of     consumer and producer prices have been somewhat larger     in recent months.On August 16, 1994, the Board of Governors approved     an increase in the discount rate from 3-1/2 to 4     percent, and the Committee agreed that this increase     would be allowed to show through completely to interest     rates in reserve markets. Most market interest rates     are up somewhat on balance since the August meeting.     The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the     other G-10 currencies depreciated somewhat over the     intermeeting period.M2 and M3 declined in August after expanding     moderately in July; for the year through August, M2 and     M3 grew at rates slightly above the bottom of their     ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has     continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary     and financial conditions that will foster price     stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In     furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its     meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established     in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent     and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the     fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994.     The Committee anticipated that developments contributing     to unusual velocity increases could persist during the     year and that money growth within these ranges would be     consistent with its broad policy objectives. The     monitoring range for growth of total domestic     nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 percent for     the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative     ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth     quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5     percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee     provisionally set the associated monitoring range for     growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent     for 1995. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will     continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward     price level stability, movements in their velocities,     and developments in the economy and financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate     future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing     degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context     of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price     stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving     careful consideration to economic, financial, and     monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve     restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint     might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The     contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be     consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over the     balance of the year.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,     McDonough, Blinder, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley,     LaWare, Lindsey, and Parry and Mses. Phillips and     Yellen.Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that a prompt move   to somewhat greater monetary restraint was needed at this point. In   his view, the current stance of monetary policy was overly   accommodative in light of the signs of increasing price pressures and   rising inflationary expectations that were associated with the   continuing strength of the economic expansion and high levels of   capacity utilization. In this situation, a delay in implementing some   monetary policy tightening would incur a substantial risk of a further   increase in inflationary expectations and could make it more costly to   achieve the Committee\\'s longer-term anti-inflationary goals.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be   held on Tuesday, November 15, 1994.The meeting adjourned at 1:00 p.m.Donald L.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these   transactions.The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments   in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions   in government securities and federal agency obligations during the   period September 27, 1994, through November 14, 1994. By unanimous   vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and   financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the   intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial   information available at the time of the meeting and of the   Committee\\'s discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic   policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the   Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the   growth of the economy remained substantial. Consumer spending was   robust, business fixed investment continued on a strong upward trend,   and housing activity had been well sustained despite the increase in   mortgage interest rates over the past year. Business inventory   investment had been brisk since the spring, apparently in response to   the strong growth in final sales. Further sizable gains had been   recorded in industrial production and employment. Increases in labor   compensation were still moderate, although there were some tentative   signs of wage acceleration associated with the further tightening of   labor markets. Prices of many materials continued to move up rapidly,   but broad indexes did not indicate a pickup in consumer inflation.Nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in   October, with job gains widespread by industry. In the service-producing sector, retail trade posted a particularly large advance   while health and business services continued to record moderate   increases. Manufacturing employment was up in October after having   been unchanged in September; the rise was related partly to continued   job growth in automobile-and construction-related industries, but   payrolls also expanded in a number of other industries, including   textiles, paper, rubber, and plastics. Construction hiring slowed   after a large rise in September. Employment, as measured by the   household survey, increased by more than the labor force in October,   and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.8 percent.Industrial production increased substantially in October   after having posted appreciable advances on balance in previous   months. Manufacturing output accounted for all of the October rise as   production declined again in the mining and utilities components. In   manufacturing, the pace of motor vehicle assemblies was unchanged, but   production in automotive-related industries was stepped up noticeably   and output of business equipment continued to expand vigorously.   Total utilization of industrial capacity climbed further in October   from already elevated rates.Consumer confidence remained at a high level, and retail   sales continued to rise rapidly in October. Automotive dealers   reported a large increase in sales, but strength also was evident   elsewhere: Furniture and appliance stores posted another appreciable   gain; apparel outlets registered a brisk rise; and spending at food   and general merchandise stores grew moderately. Housing starts rose   appreciably in September, reaching their highest level of the year.   Sales of new and existing homes were stronger in September, despite   the higher interest rates on both fixed-and adjustable-rate   mortgages that had prevailed since earlier in the year.Business capital spending remained on a solid uptrend.   Shipments of nondefense capital goods were brisk during the third   quarter, and with orders continuing to exceed shipments, already large   backlogs increased further for most types of business equipment.   Spending for transportation equipment grew at a healthy rate in the   third quarter; purchases of heavy trucks persisted at a very high   level, and spending for motor vehicles picked up after a second-quarter lull. Nonresidential construction activity advanced at a   reduced pace in the third quarter; however, permits for new   construction continued to trend higher.Business inventory investment apparently continued at a brisk   pace in the third quarter, with much of the accumulation occurring in   types of goods where sales were strong. Manufacturing stocks fell in   September, but for the third quarter as a whole they increased at the   same moderate rate as in the second quarter; the inventory-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing in September remained near the   historical low reached the previous month. At the wholesale level,   inventory accumulation slowed slightly in the third quarter, and the   inventory-to-sales ratio was in the lower end of its range over recent   years. Retail inventories surged in August (latest data available)   after having declined slightly in July. Nonetheless, the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained near the middle of its range   in recent years.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services   narrowed in August, but for July and August combined the deficit was   substantially larger than its second-quarter average. The value of   exports of goods and services rebounded in August, with increases   spread widely among automotive products, aircraft, agricultural   products, machinery, and consumer goods. The value of imports also   increased in August, but by a lesser amount than that of exports; much   of the rise reflected greater imports of automotive vehicles from   Canada. Economic activity continued to expand in the major foreign   industrial countries in the third quarter, but growth apparently was   at a more moderate pace than in the first half of the year.Consumer price inflation remained moderate in September. For   items other than the food and energy components, the increase in   consumer prices over the twelve months ending in September was   slightly smaller than the rise over the previous twelve months. At   the producer level, prices of finished goods declined, largely   reflecting a sharp fall in prices of finished energy goods. Excluding   food and energy items, producer prices edged up in September and had   risen slowly over the twelve months ending in September. At   intermediate stages of processing, prices of many materials, notably   industrial materials, had continued to move up rapidly. Total   compensation of private industry workers rose significantly less over   the four quarters ending in September than over the previous four   quarters, primarily reflecting a sharply smaller increase in benefit   costs. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory   workers recorded a large gain in September after having expanded   moderately over previous months.At its meeting on September 27, 1994, the Committee adopted a   directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure   on reserve positions but included a bias toward possible firming   during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the   context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and   sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to   economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater   reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve   restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The   reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be   consistent with modest growth of M2 and M3 over the balance of the   year.Open market operations during the intermeeting period were   directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve   positions. As the need for seasonal credit waned over the period,   adjustment plus seasonal borrowing declined substantially, with actual   borrowing remaining close to anticipated levels. Apart from some   tightness in reserves markets around the end of the third quarter, the   federal funds rate averaged close to 4-3/4 percent.Most market interest rates rose appreciably over the period   since the September 27 meeting in response to incoming economic data   that generally indicated sustained momentum in final sales and   inventory investment and high levels of aggregate output relative to   the economy\\'s potential. The strong economic data and persisting   upward pressures on prices at earlier stages of production appeared to   heighten concerns among market participants about inflationary   pressures and prospects for even more monetary tightening than had   previously been anticipated. Most major indexes of equity prices were   little changed on balance over the intermeeting period.The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other   G-10 currencies changed little on net over the intermeeting period.   The dollar trended lower over much of the period, apparently   reflecting market perceptions that inflation risks in the United   States were on the rise. In early November, after reaching a new   post-World War II low against the yen and a two-year low against the   mark, the dollar began to recover. The rebound in the value of the   dollar apparently was in part a response to U.S. intervention in   support of the dollar and heightened expectations of further monetary   tightening in the United States.M2 continued to edge lower in October; the weakness was   concentrated in its more-liquid deposit components, for which   opportunity costs had risen very substantially this year. M3 expanded   at a moderate pace, buoyed by continued rapid growth in large-denomination time deposits issued to finance rapid loan growth and to   counter runoffs of nondeposit sources of funds. For the year through   October, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the Committee\\'s range for   1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the year.   Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate   rate in recent months.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that   growth in economic activity would slow markedly over the next several   quarters and for a period would average less than the rate of increase   in the economy\\'s potential output. In the staff\\'s judgment, the   economy currently was operating at or beyond its long-run capacity,   and the forecast assumed that monetary policy would not accommodate   any continuing tendency for aggregate demand to expand at a pace that   could foster sustained higher inflation. The expansion of consumer   spending was projected to slow considerably in response to diminishing   pent-up demands, higher borrowing costs, and reduced income growth.   Business fixed investment also was anticipated to decelerate   appreciably in the context of smaller increases in sales and less   favorable financial conditions. Homebuilding was expected to be   damped by higher financing costs, although housing activity likely   would remain well above the depressed levels of recent years when   cash-flow affordability had been less favorable. The lower value of   the dollar and the favorable prospects for faster economic recovery   abroad were projected to bolster the demand for U.S. exports. With   the economy having reached or exceeded its long-run potential in the   staff\\'s judgment, wage and price inflation was projected to pick up   for a period before turning down as pressures on productive resources   eased.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective   economic developments, members commented on widespread statistical and   anecdotal indications of considerably greater strength in the business   expansion than they had anticipated earlier, with numerous industries   now operating at or beyond historic, long-run capacity levels. They   saw few signs that growth in aggregate demand might be moderating   toward a more sustainable pace; nonetheless, they continued to view   some slowing as a reasonable expectation as the monetary policy   tightening actions implemented earlier exerted their lagged effects on   interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. At this point, increases   in prices of final goods and services and in wages generally did not   appear to be trending higher, but the members were concerned that   inflation would worsen as the effects of continuing strong demand,   rising production costs, and higher import prices increasingly were   felt in an environment where the utilization of labor and other   producer resources was already at, if not above, sustainable full   employment levels.The evidence of persisting growth in aggregate demand at a   pace appreciably above that of the economy\\'s long-run potential and of   developing pressures on resources tended to be confirmed by anecdotal   reports of robust business expansion in many parts of the country and   growing difficulties in hiring and retaining some types of labor.   Ongoing cutbacks in some industries, such as defense, were tending to   hold down overall economic activity in a few regions, but all parts of   the country appeared to be experiencing at least modest economic   growth, including California where economic activity now seemed to   have turned up after an extended period of weakness. Sentiment among   retailers and other business contacts was widely reported to be quite   favorable. In addition, some members commented that despite higher   interest rates financial conditions generally remained conducive to   further business expansion. The lending constraints that had tended   to retard the expansion earlier seemed to have given way to   increasingly accommodative loan policies by depository institutions   and ready access to market sources of financing for many business   firms.In their assessment of the contribution of key sectors of the   economy to the expansion, members commented on the current strength of   consumer spending and also noted that business contacts were   expressing considerable optimism about the prospects for retail sales   over the holiday season. Consumer sentiment, as evidenced by survey   results and retailer comments, appeared to be at a high level. Some   moderation in the growth of consumer spending could be expected to   emerge next year for a variety of reasons, including reduced pent-up   demands and some anticipated slowing in the growth of employment and   consumer incomes. Members also noted that rising interest rates were   likely to damp consumer spending, notably for durable goods, though   there was little evidence of such a development thus far. A projected   softening in housing markets would contribute to slower growth in   demand for housing-related consumer durables.Expanding sales and favorable profit margins were fostering   strong growth in business fixed investment, and much of the momentum   in this sector probably would carry over into 1995. Some business   contacts reported that they were developing plans for major capital   outlays over coming months. As the year progressed, however, the   increases that had occurred in interest rates, and the possibility of   less receptive financial conditions more generally, should begin to   exert some inhibiting effects on business fixed investment, especially   if profit margins also were to fall in the context of rising labor and   other costs.With regard to the outlook for housing, members reported that   conditions were somewhat uneven across the country but that for the   nation as a whole rising mortgage rates had had surprisingly little   effect thus far on this typically interest-sensitive sector of the   economy. One reason, it was suggested, was the apparent willingness   of some homebuyers to accept higher mortgage rates at this point   because they expected rates to rise further later. Even so, the   members continued to anticipate some slowdown in housing construction   over coming quarters. Overall construction activity was likely to be   supported to some extent, however, by further gradual gains in   nonresidential construction, notably commercial and industrial   structures, and perhaps some continuing strength in multifamily   housing.After a surge in the second quarter, inventory investment   remained substantial in the third quarter and appeared to be   continuing at a robust pace in the current quarter. For a variety of   reasons, inventory accumulation might well be relatively brisk for   some period of time, given the favorable sales experience of numerous   business firms and the still quite low levels of inventories relative   to sales. Moreover, with capacity pressures in many industries   leading to some lengthening in delivery times, businesses would tend   to build inventories to support sales and avoid disruptions to   production schedules. Tending to confirm such an assessment were   anecdotal reports suggesting that recent additions to inventories were   largely intended and not the result of disappointing sales. An   inventory buildup at the pace recorded on average in the second and   third quarters would not be sustainable, but inventory investment was   likely to be relatively well maintained over coming months if   aggregate demand were to expand in line with current expectations.The members generally anticipated that the external sector of   the economy would provide some impetus to the expansion. The recent   depreciation of the dollar and strength in foreign economic activity   could be expected to boost real exports at a time when growth in real   imports was likely to moderate. The resulting improvement in the   nation\\'s net trade position would, however, tend to exacerbate any   tendency for domestic demand to outrun the economy\\'s output potential.In the Committee\\'s discussion of the outlook for prices,   the members saw considerable potential for higher inflation if growth   in demand and output continued at an unsustainable pace, placing added   pressures on labor and other producer resources. They noted   indications of greater inflation pressures, especially in the rising   prices of many materials used in the production process and the   increasing number of reports of labor shortages. To date, prices of   finished goods and services did not reflect those pressures and   overall wage inflation did not appear to be trending higher. Even so,   at least some modest worsening of inflation seemed quite likely over   the quarters immediately ahead, despite the persistence of strong   competition that continued to limit attempts to raise prices in most   markets. This view seemed to be reinforced by increasing reports of   successful efforts by some business firms to establish and sustain   higher prices and by numerous indications of business plans to raise   prices around year-end or the early part of next year. Other factors   that appeared to have adverse implications for the inflation outlook   included faster increases in import prices, and in the view of at   least some members the prospect of diminishing gains in productivity.   Moreover, as evidenced by the comments of some business contacts and   the behavior of financial markets, inflationary expectations might be   in the process of worsening, though such a development could not be   seen in broad survey results. To what extent such expectations would   become more pervasive and foster greater inflation momentum was very   difficult to gauge at this point. One member suggested that some   further rise in inflation might reflect a typical development in a   maturing cyclical expansion but that such a rise would not necessarily   augur a permanent uptick in inflation or even that progress toward   price stability would not continue to be made over time, provided   appropriate monetary policies were pursued.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting   period ahead, all the members agreed that the current stance of   monetary policy presented unacceptable risks of embedding higher   inflation in the economy. The expansion retained appreciably more   forward momentum and greater inflationary potential than the members   had anticipated, given the policy restraint implemented earlier this   year. The reasons for that outcome remained unclear. Among the   suggested explanations were that the earlier restraint appeared to   have had a less-than-expected effect on current economic conditions   and, in particular, on the more interest-sensitive sectors of the   economy. Some members also suggested that the underlying expansion   was stronger than they had anticipated, and a couple referred to the   possibility that the lingering effects from the accommodative policy   stance maintained through last year were larger than had been   expected. Moreover, additional monetary restraint seemed to be needed   to counteract the stimulative effects on domestic economic activity of   a number of atypical financial developments in a period of rising   interest rates; these included the easing of non-price credit terms by   depository institutions, the ample availability of funds in debt and   equity markets, and the depreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange   markets. The members recognized that monetary policy actions exerted   much of their effects after relatively long lags and that a   substantial portion of the restraint stemming from the earlier policy   actions undoubtedly had not yet been felt in the economy. They   agreed, nonetheless, that monetary policy was still insufficiently   restrictive in light of emerging inflationary signals in the economy.   Views differed to some extent, however, regarding the degree of   additional restraint that might be needed to foster the Committee\\'s   objectives for sustainable, noninflationary economic growth.A majority of the members believed that an unusually sizable   firming of monetary policy was desirable at this time, and they   endorsed a proposal to tighten reserve conditions in line with a 3/4   percentage point increase in the discount rate that a number of   Federal Reserve Banks had proposed for approval by the Board of   Governors. In this view, the data becoming available in recent months   had suggested considerable resilience and underlying strength in   economic activity and rising risks of greater inflation pressures. A   somewhat aggressive tightening action would improve the prospects for   curbing intensifying inflationary pressures before they gathered   further momentum and would help position the economy on a sustainable   growth path consistent with the economy\\'s long-run potential. The   members acknowledged the difficulty of judging the precise degree of   monetary restraint that would be needed to attain the Committee\\'s   objectives and in particular the risk that further efforts to control   inflation at this juncture might foster greater-than-intended   weakening of the expansion. The Committee could not prejudge how   much, if any, additional monetary restraint might be needed in the   future. That would depend on further developments, but for most   members a sizable move at this point represented the most appropriate   balance among the competing risks. During this discussion, it was   noted that recent developments were having an unsettling effect on   financial markets, and a tightening move of this magnitude might   contribute to market stability by reducing expectations of higher   inflation and a further near-term policy action. Some members also   commented that the action would tend to reinforce the recent   intervention in the foreign exchange markets.Other members indicated that they preferred a less forceful   policy move at this point, one that would be consistent with the 1/2   percentage point increase in the discount rate that had been proposed   by several Federal Reserve Banks. In their view, substantial further   restraint could be expected from the combined effects of the policy   tightening actions implemented earlier this year and the inevitable   waning of the stimulative effects of policy actions taken in previous   years. While the need for further monetary restraint could not be   ruled out, a more limited policy move at this point could reasonably   be expected in this view to accomplish the greater part or all of the   Committee\\'s anti-inflationary objectives over time and would minimize   the risk of setting policy on an overly restrictive course with   undesired consequences for the business expansion later. Moreover, a   cautious approach could lessen the risk that the Committee\\'s policy   intentions would be misinterpreted, with some resulting damage to   consumer and business confidence and dislocation in financial markets.   Despite their reservations, these members indicated that they could   accept the degree of restraint preferred by the majority because of   the quite small difference in the effects of the alternative moves on   the economy over time.With regard to possible changes in policy during the period   until the next meeting, a majority of the members favored associating   the more substantial policy adjustment with a symmetric intermeeting   instruction. This preference was based on expectations that a further   policy action was not likely to be called for over the near term,   although a symmetric directive would not prevent an intermeeting   adjustment if near-term developments differed substantially from   expectations. One member expressed the view that the unusually large   move made it especially important to follow a steady policy course for   some period of time and to undertake any further firming only if new   information of a surprisingly strong nature were to be received.   Another member indicated a preference for an asymmetric directive   toward restraint because such a directive would be more consistent   with the likely need in his view for further monetary restraint to   contain inflationary forces in the economy.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s policy discussion, all   the members indicated they could support a directive that called for a   significant increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions,   taking account of a possible increase of 3/4 percentage point in the   discount rate, and that did not include a presumption about the likely   direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period.   Accordingly, in the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for   price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful   consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the   Committee decided that somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve   restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period.   According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at   this meeting would be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over   coming months.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of   New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by   the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in   accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests     that the growth of the economy has remained substantial. Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably     further in October, and the civilian unemployment rate     edged down to 5.8 percent. Industrial production     registered a large increase in October after posting     sizable gains on average over other recent months, and     capacity utilization moved up further from already high     levels. Retail sales have continued to rise rapidly.     Housing starts rose appreciably in September. Orders     for nondefense capital goods point to a continued     strong expansion in spending on business equipment;     permits for nonresidential construction have been     trending higher. Inventory accumulation appears to     have continued at a brisk pace in the third quarter.     For July and August combined, the nominal deficit on     U.S. trade in goods and services widened from its     second-quarter average. Prices of many materials have     continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of     prices for consumer goods and services have increased     moderately on average over recent months.Most market interest rates have risen appreciably     since the September meeting. The trade-weighted value     of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was     essentially unchanged on balance over the intermeeting     period, though it was weaker through much of the     period.M2 contracted further in October while M3 expanded     at a moderate pace, buoyed by continued rapid growth in     large-denomination time deposits. For the year through     October, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the     Committee\\'s range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the     lower half of its range for the year. Total domestic     nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate     rate in recent months.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary     and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In     furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its     meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5     percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from     the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of     1994. The Committee anticipated that developments     contributing to unusual velocity increases could     persist during the year and that money growth within     these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy     objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total     domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8     percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed     on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from     the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of     1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for     M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated     monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial     debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the     monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in     the light of progress toward price level stability,     movements in their velocities, and developments in the     economy and financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate     future, the Committee seeks to increase significantly     the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions,     taking account of a possible increase in the discount     rate. In the context of the Committee\\'s long-run     objectives for price stability and sustainable economic     growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,     financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater     reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint     would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The     contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be     consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming     months.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,     McDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan,     Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey, Parry and Mses. Phillips     and Yellen.Votes against this action: None.Secretary\\'s note: The meeting was recessed briefly at this     point and the members of the Board of Governors convened to consider     pending Reserve Bank proposals for increases in the discount rate.     After the conclusion of that meeting, the Presidents of the Federal     Reserve Banks were informed that the Board of Governors had approved an     increase of 3/4 percentage point in the discount rate, effective     immediately, and the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee then     resumed.System Foreign Currency ArrangementsThe Committee considered the renewal of the System\\'s currency   (\"swap\") arrangements with foreign central banks. These arrangements   normally have one-year maturities and, except for those with the Bank   of Canada and the Bank of Mexico, were due to mature on various dates   in December 1994.In the course of their review, the members discussed sterilized intervention by the Federal Reserve in the foreign exchange   markets. They generally agreed that in certain circumstances such   intervention serves a useful purpose, such as helping to counter   disorderly market conditions, but it normally would not be expected to   have lasting effects on the foreign exchange value of the dollar in   the absence of other policy adjustments. In the overwhelming number   of instances for more than a decade, the Federal Reserve has participated jointly with the U.S. Treasury in foreign exchange operations.   In the view of most members it seemed advisable to continue that   procedure, especially given the System\\'s responsibilities for the   overall financial health of the economy and ongoing cooperation with   the Treasury regarding the nation\\'s broad financial objectives.   Nonetheless, the apparently limited and temporary effectiveness of   sterilized intervention counseled caution in reliance on such   transactions. Against this background, nearly all the members   believed that the System\\'s reciprocal currency arrangements, which   were a potential source of foreign currencies that might be used for   intervention purposes as well as an ongoing symbol of cooperation with   other participating central banks, should be renewed for another year.At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee   authorized the renewal for further periods of one year of the System\\'s   reciprocal currency arrangements with twelve foreign central banks and   the Bank for International Settlements. The amounts and existing   maturity dates of the arrangements are indicated in the table that   follows:Foreign bankAmount of arrangement               (millions of $ equivalent)Term      (months)Maturitydate Austrian National Bank$ 250.012 mos.12/04/94Bank of England3,000.012 mos.12/04/94 Bank of Japan5,000.012 mos.12/04/94Bank of Mexico3,000.020 mos.12/15/95Bank of Norway\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0250.012 mos.12/04/94Bank of Sweden\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0300.012 mos.12/04/94Swiss National Bank4,000.012 mos.12/04/94Bank for International Settlements -- Swiss francs600.012 mos.12/04/94Other authorized European currencies1,250.012 mos.12/04/94National Bank of Belgium1,000.012 mos.12/18/94Bank of Canada2,000.020 mos.12/15/95National Bank of Denmark\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0250.012 mos.12/28/94Bank of France2,000.012 mos.12/28/94 German Federal Bank 6,000.012 mos.12/28/94Bank of Italy 3,000.012 mos.12/28/94Netherlands Bank \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0500.012 mos.12/28/94Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,    McDonough, Blinder. Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley,   LaWare, Lindsey, and Parry and Mses. Phillips and   Yellen.Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that the Federal   Reserve\\'s participation in foreign exchange market intervention   compromises its ability to conduct monetary policy effectively.   Because sterilized intervention cannot have sustained effects in the   absence of conforming monetary policy actions, Federal Reserve   participation in foreign exchange operations risks one of two   undesirable outcomes. First, the independence of monetary policy is   jeopardized if the System adjusts its policy actions to support short-term foreign exchange objectives set by the Treasury. Alternatively,   the credibility of monetary policy is damaged if the System does not   follow interventions with compatible policy actions, the interventions   consequently fail to achieve their objectives, and the System is   associated in the mind of the public with the failed operations. In   these circumstances, he did not view renewal of the existing swap   lines as desirable because they are used primarily to facilitate   market intervention.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be   held on Tuesday, December 20, 1994.The meeting adjourned at 2:05 p.m.Donald L.

Left before discussion of the economic situation.By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal   Open Market Committee held on November 15, 1994, were approved.By unanimous vote, the Committee elected Mark S. Sniderman as   Associate Economist from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to   serve until the next election at the first meeting of the Committee   after December 31, 1994, with the understanding that in the event he   discontinued his official connection with the Federal Reserve Bank of   Cleveland, he would cease to have any official connection with the   Federal Open Market Committee.The Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments   in foreign exchange markets since the November meeting. There were no   System open market transactions in foreign currencies during this   period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments   in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions   in government securities and federal agency obligations during the   period November 15, 1994, through December 19, 1994. By unanimous   vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and   financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the   intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial   information available at the time of the meeting and of the   Committee\\'s discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic   policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the   Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested a further   pickup in economic growth in recent months. Consumer spending,   supported by strong expansion of employment and income and by buoyant   consumer sentiment, remained robust. Business capital spending and   exports were rising briskly. Payroll employment remained on a strong   upward trend, and industrial output posted further substantial gains.   Broad indexes of prices of consumer goods and services increased   moderately on average over recent months, although prices of many   industrial materials and intermediate supplies continued to move up   rapidly.Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in November after an   appreciable expansion in October. Job gains in the service-producing   sector were stronger in November than in October, as a pickup in   hiring in business services more than offset slower growth in health   services and retail trade. Employment in manufacturing recorded   another sizable advance in November, with increases widespread by   industry. Hiring in construction was up considerably in November   after a small gain in October. Job growth outpaced the expansion of   the labor force in November, and the civilian unemployment rate   declined to 5.6 percent.Industrial production, led by further increases in   manufacturing output, registered another large gain in November.   Among major market groups, production of business equipment surged and   sizable increases were recorded for the output of materials and   construction supplies. With the growth of production outpacing the   expansion of capacity in November, the rate of utilization of total   industrial capacity moved up further from an already high level.Retail sales continued to rise rapidly in November. Sales   were up solidly at most types of stores, but gains were particularly   large at durable goods outlets. Consumer spending on services also   had grown significantly in October (latest data), with advances   widespread among categories of services. Housing starts increased   appreciably in November, when construction activity apparently was   boosted by favorable weather in some parts of the country.   Multifamily starts rose in November to their highest level in four   years, while single-family starts retraced a large part of their   October decline.Business capital spending remained on a pronounced upward   trend. Shipments of nondefense capital goods other than aircraft were   up slightly further in October after having advanced sharply in the   two previous months; shipments of computing equipment were brisk in   October, while shipments of other capital goods were little changed.   With regard to transportation equipment, outlays for aircraft   continued to trend lower in October, while sales of heavy trucks rose   appreciably. Recent data on orders for nondefense capital goods   pointed to continued vigorous expansion of spending on business   equipment. Nonresidential construction activity advanced further in   October, led by higher spending for institutional and public utility   structures. The uptrend in permits suggested further advances in   nonresidential construction.Business inventory investment was relatively robust in   October. Manufacturing inventories rebounded after a small decline in   September; a sizable amount of the October increase occurred at firms   producing computers, office machinery, and telecommunications   equipment for which demand had been strong. For manufacturing as a   whole, the stocks-to-shipments ratio remained near a historically low   level. Wholesale inventories continued to climb at a pace in line   with sales, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector stayed   near the middle of its range over recent years. Retail inventory   accumulation slowed substantially in October; much of the slowdown   reflected a sharp drop in stocks at automotive dealerships. With   sales up sharply, the inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector   fell in October and remained near the middle of its range over recent   years.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services   widened somewhat in October from its September level and from its   average rate for the third quarter. The increase in the deficit from   September\\'s level reflected a small decline in the value of exports of   goods and services, which resulted primarily from reduced aircraft   shipments, and a small rise in the value of imports. Economic   activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand   rapidly in the third quarter, and available indicators generally   suggested further substantial gains in the fourth quarter.Despite further sizable increases in the prices of many goods   at the early stages of processing, inflation at the consumer level   remained moderate in October and November. Energy prices were   unchanged on balance over the two months, while food prices edged   higher. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices advanced at   a slightly slower rate over October and November than in earlier   months of the year and also increased a little less over the twelve   months ended in November than over the comparable year-earlier period.   At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and   energy were down over the October-November period, but they rose by a   little larger amount for the twelve months ended in November than they   had in the year-earlier period. The increase in average hourly   earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers over the October-November period remained in the moderate range that had prevailed for   some time, although a pickup in earnings growth was evident in a few   sectors, notably construction and services. Over the past twelve   months, hourly earnings increased at a slightly faster pace than they   had over the year-earlier period.At its meeting on November 15, 1994, the Committee adopted a   directive that called for a significant increase in the degree of   pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible rise of   3/4 percentage point in the discount rate. The Committee did not   include in the directive a presumption about likely further   adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly,   the directive stated that in the context of the Committee\\'s long-run   objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and   giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary   developments, somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint   would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve   conditions associated with this directive were expected to be   consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.On the day of the meeting, the Board of Governors approved a   3/4 percentage point rise in the discount rate, to a level of 4-3/4   percent. The increase in the discount rate was made effective   immediately and was passed through fully to interest rates in the   market for reserves. Open market operations during the intermeeting   period were conducted with a view to maintaining the tighter policy   stance implemented immediately after the meeting, and the federal   funds rate remained near 5-1/2 percent. Adjustment plus seasonal   borrowing, reflecting the usual late-autumn pattern of ebbing demand   for seasonal credit, declined over the intermeeting period; actual   borrowing was close to anticipated levels.Short-term interest rates rose considerably over the period   after the November meeting. These rates had increased before the   meeting in anticipation of a policy tightening move, but the size of   the move was larger than expected and rates firmed a little further as   a result. Over the remainder of the intermeeting interval, short-term   rates responded to incoming economic data, for a time rising in   reaction to indications of continuing strength in economic activity   and later retracing a portion of these increases in response to   favorable news on inflation. Rates on private money-market   instruments with very short maturities also were lifted somewhat in   anticipation of the usual year-end pressures. Long-term rates   declined slightly over the intermeeting period. The more favorable   inflation data, together with the relatively aggressive tightening   action, apparently were viewed by many market participants as   indicating that monetary policy would be sufficiently firm to hold   inflation in check. The revelations in early December of financial   difficulties in Orange County, California and concerns about their   potential spread had a disruptive effect on financial markets, notably   those for municipal securities, but aside from the securities of the   affected communities, the disruption generally was brief. Most major   indexes of equity prices fell, on balance, over the intermeeting   period.The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other   G-10 currencies increased further over the intermeeting period, with   the dollar gaining about equally against the mark and the yen. The   unexpected size of the monetary policy move in November, the economic   news received over the period, and the growing expectation that policy   would be tightened again before long all appeared to contribute to the   dollar\\'s rise.Growth of M2 resumed in November after several months of   decline. M2\\'s expansion largely reflected sizable inflows to small   time deposits and retail money market funds that in part might have   been associated with accelerated outflows from bond mutual funds and   reduced inflows to stock mutual funds. M3 growth slowed a little in   November as some investors shifted funds from institution-only money   market accounts, whose opportunity costs had widened after the   November policy tightening, into direct holdings of securities. For   the year through November, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the   Committee\\'s range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its   range for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had continued to   expand at a moderate rate in recent months, and through October   (latest data) this debt measure had grown at a rate in the lower half   of its monitoring range.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that   growth of economic activity would slow markedly over the next few   quarters and then would average less than the rate of increase in the   economy\\'s potential output over the remainder of the forecast horizon.   In the staff\\'s judgment, the economy currently was operating beyond   its long-run noninflationary capacity, and the forecast assumed that   monetary policy would not accommodate any continuing tendency for   aggregate demand to expand at a pace that could foster sustained   higher inflation. Growth of consumer spending was expected to decline   substantially in response to slower income growth, higher borrowing   costs, and reductions in household net worth associated with lower   asset values. Business outlays for new equipment were projected to be   damped considerably by slower growth in sales, higher financing costs,   and declining profits. Homebuilding also was expected to soften in   response to higher financing costs, but the relatively favorable cash-flow affordability of housing was anticipated to act as a partial   offset to those increased costs. The projected robust pace of   economic activity abroad was expected to bolster export demand. With   the economy having exceeded its noninflationary potential in the   staff\\'s judgment, wage and price inflation was projected to pick up   for a period before turning down as pressures on productive resources   eased.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective   economic developments, members referred to continuing indications of   robust expansion in employment, output, and spending and to very high   and rising levels of resource utilization. They saw scant evidence at   this point of any moderation in the growth of overall economic   activity, including little apparent response thus far in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy to earlier policy tightening actions.   Several observed that much of the expansionary momentum in the economy   was likely to carry into at least the early part of next year, with   potential inflationary consequences, but a number also commented that   appreciable slowing during the year to a more sustainable and less   inflationary pace remained a reasonable expectation. It was likely   that much of the restraint from the policy firming actions implemented   this year had not yet been experienced; those actions had reversed an   accommodative policy that had been in place through early 1994, the   effects of which probably were still being felt in the latter part of   1994. The members acknowledged that the timing and extent of the   slowing in the expansion were subject to considerable uncertainty.   However, with the economy now operating at or even slightly above its   noninflationary potential, price and wage pressures were likely to   build unless the anticipated slowing occurred relatively soon. Key   measures of inflation including consumer prices, wages, and producer   prices of finished goods did not display any evident uptrend at this   juncture, but this could reflect a delay in the adjustment of   inflation to capacity constraints and possibly some greater   productivity and flexibility in the economy than had been assumed.In the course of the Committee\\'s discussion, members reported   on regional business conditions, which continued to exhibit local   variations ranging from modest expansion in some areas to robust   growth in others. Reflecting widespread strength in new orders,   manufacturing firms outside the defense industry typically were   operating at high levels of capacity utilization, and there were   numerous anecdotal reports of tightening labor markets. As they had   at earlier meetings, members remarked that despite the increases that   had occurred in interest rates, financial conditions remained   generally supportive of vigorous economic activity. Some noted that   the financial markets were displaying a great deal of resilience and   in particular that they had on balance weathered fairly readily the   recent financial problems of a number of local governments and private   corporations that had experienced large unanticipated losses on their   investments. Banking institutions remained aggressive in their   efforts to extend loans to businesses and consumers.In their comments on developments in key sectors of the   economy, members noted that consumer spending had increased briskly in   recent months amid indications of favorable consumer sentiment that in   turn undoubtedly reflected the rapid growth in employment and income.   It was still too early to form reliable estimates of retail sales in   the current holiday season. The anecdotal reports pointed to seasonal   increases ranging from moderate to strong in various regions, but some   members emphasized that sales volumes were being buttressed by unusual   promotional efforts, including relatively large discounts. Some   members also commented that consumer debt was growing rapidly and that   increased debt levels were likely to exert a retarding effect on   consumer spending, especially if consumer loan rates were to be   adjusted more fully upward to reflect increases in market interest   rates. Rates on adjustable home mortgages were moving higher to catch   up with market rates and these increases along with the wealth effects   from losses suffered on bond and stock holdings were likely to damp   spending. Up to now, however, the members saw few signs of any   moderation in the growth of consumer spending, including little   apparent effect from somewhat higher interest rates on normally   interest-sensitive spending for motor vehicles and other consumer   durables.Business fixed investment, which was contributing substantially to the current strength of the expansion, was likely to remain   a positive factor in sustaining the overall growth of the economy   during the year ahead. Even so, as the expansion matured and growth   in final demand tended to moderate, business investment could be   expected to soften. As in the case of consumer spending, however,   there were few signs of any slowing in the current data or anecdotal   reports. Indeed, members saw growing indications of some improvement   in nonresidential construction activity as brisk economic expansion   tended to absorb increasing amounts of previously vacant commercial   and industrial space and prices of such facilities tended to firm. In   the homebuilding sector, the latest available data did not indicate   any weakening in housing construction despite the rise in mortgage   interest rates. However, anecdotal reports from different parts of   the country suggested that the single-family sector might be   weakening. At the same time, construction of multifamily units   continued to exhibit strength in a number of areas, and this sector   appeared to be on a gradual uptrend as falling vacancy rates brought   increases in rents. On balance, some modest softening in overall   housing construction was seen as likely in response to the rise that   had occurred in mortgage interest rates.Inventory investment was cited as another sector of the   economy that probably would exert a negative influence on economic   activity over the year ahead, though inventory developments are always   subject to a great deal of uncertainty. The strength of inventory   investment in recent quarters reflected efforts to accommodate rapid   growth in final demand and avoid disruptions to production in a period   when supply delivery times were tending to lengthen. Inventory   accumulation might remain elevated for a while longer, but as the   projected slowing in the growth of final demand began to materialize,   business firms were likely to curtail the growth of their   inventories, perhaps sharply for some period, in order to maintain   desired inventory-to-sales ratios.The government sector constituted another source of   considerable uncertainty in the outlook for 1995. Members referred   to major fiscal policy initiatives that were likely to be considered   in the new Congress, and they discussed possible short-and long-term   effects on the economy. However, the shape of any legislation was   still to be determined and it was not possible at this point to gauge   its effects on government or private spending. On the other hand,   spending by state and local governments was clearly trending higher   and was likely to provide a mild impetus to the overall expansion; the   financial difficulties of some local governments undoubtedly would   serve to curb their spending but were not seen at this point as having   any significant effect on the growth in overall expenditures by state   and local governments.With regard to the external sector of the economy, members   continued to anticipate strengthening markets for U.S. exports over   the year ahead. Projected growth in exports would be stimulated by   the further expansion of economic activity in major U.S. trading   partners and by the delayed effects of the weakening of the dollar   that had occurred on balance over the course of 1994. Some members   cited anecdotal indications of stronger foreign demand for   agricultural and other goods produced in the United States.Despite the evidence of vigorous expansion in overall   economic activity and very high levels of resource use, broad measures   of inflation in markets for finished goods and overall wage inflation   had been on the low side of expectations recently. Anecdotal reports   continued to point to very strong competition in most markets for   final goods, and business firms continued to encounter widespread   resistance in their efforts to increase prices as the costs of their   raw materials and other inputs moved higher. Likewise, no uptrend   currently was discernible in broad measures of wages even though labor   markets were widely described as tight and labor shortages appeared to   have increased further recently in some parts of the country. While   examples of upward pressures on wages could be found in a number of   industries, such as construction where there were pronounced shortages   of skilled labor in many local areas, most business firms were   strongly resisting sizable increases in their wages and were making   use of \"hiring bonuses\" and \"performance bonuses\" instead of   permanently higher wages to attract or retain workers. At the same   time, job insecurities, including the potential loss of health and   pension benefits, appeared to be holding down labor mobility and   demands for higher compensation. However, many members commented that   rising pressures on capacity, should they persist or intensify, could   be expected to foster greater inflation at some point. Indeed, there   were numerous reports of business plans to raise prices early in the   new year, and a number of members commented that inflation probably   would worsen somewhat over the near term. The subsequent behavior of   prices and wages would depend importantly on fiscal and monetary   policy developments, the extent of inflationary expectations among   businesses and consumers, and the degree of pressure that further   economic expansion would exert on capacity in various industries and   occupations. Given their projections of some moderation in the   business expansion and assuming appropriate fiscal and monetary   policies, the members generally felt that any added inflation emerging   in 1995 would likely be mild and could subside gradually during the   year.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting   period ahead, a majority of the members agreed on the desirability of   maintaining an unchanged policy posture at least through the beginning   of 1995. Monetary policy had been tightened considerably in a series   of steps starting in February, and much of the restraint stemming from   those policy moves had not yet been felt in the economy. This was   especially true with regard to the effects of the latest policy moves   in August and November, which accounted for half the total tightening.   In the circumstances, a pause seemed warranted to give the Committee   more time to assess the underlying strength of the economy and the   impact of previous monetary restraint. This would provide a firmer   basis for gauging the appropriate scope and timing of any further   monetary restraint that might be needed to contain inflation. The   level of real short-term interest rates, which had risen considerably   this year and were now significantly positive, the uniformly sluggish   behavior of the monetary aggregates, and the recent appreciation of   the dollar might indicate that policy was now better positioned to   restrain incipient inflation. It was noted that the Committee might   have gained some leeway to maintain an unchanged policy without   adverse expectational effects in light of the relatively large policy   tightening implemented just a few weeks ago and the publication of   favorable price and wage data that probably had alleviated, at least   temporarily, concerns about future inflation. A number of members   also commented that financial markets might tend to be a bit unsettled   over the balance of the year as a result of the expected year-end   adjustments along with the uncertainty about the effects and incidence   of the sizable market losses incurred by some investors in 1994. In   these circumstances, where there did not appear to be an urgent need   for a further policy move, a number of members viewed conditions in   financial markets as arguing for a steady policy course pending a   reassessment early next year.A few members expressed a preference for some additional   tightening of policy at this meeting. In their view, the considerable   strength of the economic expansion and the high level of resource   utilization argued for further monetary restraint to counter   inflationary pressures; immediate action also would moderate   inflationary expectations by reinforcing the credibility of the   System\\'s anti-inflationary effort. All but one of these members   indicated, however, that they could accept an unchanged directive that   was biased toward possible firming during the intermeeting period.On the issue of possible adjustments to policy during the   period until the next meeting, a majority of the members expressed a   preference for an asymmetric directive tilted toward restraint. While   most of these members preferred not to tighten policy at this point,   they believed that the need for further monetary restraint was highly   likely, though it would remain contingent on the tenor of the new   information, including data on holiday retail sales, that would begin   to arrive shortly after the turn of the year. Should the need for   more restraint become apparent, it would be desirable in this view for   the appropriate policy move to be made promptly to arrest any   worsening of inflation and inflationary expectations, thereby   minimizing the cumulative policy tightening that would be required and   the ultimate cost of bringing inflation under control. The Committee   always had the option of adjusting its policy during intermeeting   periods even under a symmetric directive, but the balance of risks in   the outlook argued in the view of these members for a policy reaction   to new information that was best characterized by an asymmetric   directive.The other members who favored an unchanged policy preferred a   symmetric directive. In their view, the information that would be   released in the weeks immediately ahead was not likely to depart   sufficiently from current expectations to warrant a policy tightening   move during the intermeeting period. Moreover, current forecasts were   subject to some risks in both directions. Those in the direction of   appreciably greater-than-projected slowing in the expansion might have   a relatively low probability, at least over the quarters immediately   ahead, but that risk could not be ruled out and argued for a cautious   approach to any further tightening. Accordingly, the Committee should   wait until the next scheduled meeting when more information, possibly   including a better assessment of the outlook for fiscal policy, would   be available for evaluating the need for any further firming of   monetary policy. One member expressed the view that it would be   desirable to make any further short-run policy moves in the context of   the Committee\\'s long-run strategy to be considered at the next   meeting. Despite their preferences, these members said that they   would not dissent from an asymmetric directive.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all but one   member indicated that they could support a directive that called for   maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and   that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions   during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the   Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable   economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,   financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that   somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly   lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting   period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were   expected to be consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary   aggregates over coming months.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of   New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by   the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in   accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests     a further pickup in economic growth in recent months.     Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in November,     and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.6     percent. Industrial production registered another     large increase in November and capacity utilization     moved up further from already high levels. Retail     sales have continued to rise rapidly. Housing starts     increased appreciably in November. Orders for     nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong     expansion in spending on business equipment; permits     for nonresidential construction have been trending     higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and     services widened somewhat in October from its average     rate in the third quarter. Prices of many materials     have continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of     prices for consumer goods and services have increased     moderately on average over recent months.On November 15, 1994, the Board of Governors     approved an increase from 4 to 4-3/4 percent in the     discount rate, and in line with the Committee\\'s     decision the increase was allowed to show through fully     to interest rates in reserve markets. In the period     since the November meeting, short-term interest rates     have risen considerably while long-term rates have     declined slightly. The trade-weighted value of the     dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies recovered     further over the intermeeting period.Growth of M2 resumed in November after several     months of decline, while M3 expanded moderately     further. For the year through November, M2 grew at a     rate at the bottom of the Committee\\'s range for 1994     and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the     year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued     to expand at a moderate rate in recent months and for     the year-to-date it has grown at a rate in the lower     half of its monitoring range.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary     and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In     furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its     meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5     percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from     the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of     1994. The Committee anticipated that developments     contributing to unusual velocity increases could     persist during the year and that money growth within     these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy     objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total     domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8     percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed     on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from     the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of     1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for     M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated     monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial     debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the     monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in     the light of progress toward price level stability,     movements in their velocities, and developments in the     economy and financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate     future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing     degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the     context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for     price stability and sustainable economic growth, and     giving careful consideration to economic, financial,     and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve     restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint     might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The     contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be     consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming     months.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,     McDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan,     Kelley, Lindsey, and Parry and Mses. Phillips and     Yellen.Vote against this action: Mr. LaWare.Mr. LaWare dissented because he favored an immediate policy   tightening action. In his opinion, the expansion remained quite   strong, with high and increasing levels of utilization in labor and   capital markets, and he saw a serious risk of rising inflation. In   the circumstances, he also feared that a failure by the Committee to   take restraining action could heighten inflationary expectations by   raising concerns about the System\\'s commitment to the objective of   sustainable, noninflationary economic growth.Temporary Increase in Reciprocal Currency Agreement with Bank of Mexico.At a meeting conducted via a telephone conference on December   30, 1994, the Committee approved a temporary increase from $3 billion to   $4-1/2 billion in the System\\'s reciprocal currency (swap) agreement with   the Bank of Mexico; it was understood that all drawings, including those   under the permanent tranche of the System\\'s swap agreement with the Bank   of Mexico, would be subject to a determination that appropriate terms   and conditions had been met. The U.S. Treasury also increased its swap   facility with the Bank of Mexico by $1-1/2 billion to $4-1/2 billion,   thereby raising the total for official U.S. facilities to $9.0 billion.   The increases were in response to recent financial developments in   Mexico. The Committee was informed at this meeting that the Bank of   Canada would be considering an increase in its own CAN $1.0 billion   facility with the Bank of Mexico, and that additional official financing   assistance was being negotiated with the other G-10 central banks and   the Bank of Spain.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan     McDonough, Blinder, Jordan, Kelley, LaWare,     Lindsey, Melzer and Parry and Ms. Yellen.Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.Absent and not voting: Mr. Forrestal and Ms.   Phillips. Mr. Melzer voted as alternate for Mr.   Forrestal.Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to question the   desirability of the System\\'s foreign exchange market intervention and   therefore the desirability of maintaining or enlarging the swap   arrangements that facilitate them. In his view continued System   participation in such operations with the U.S. Treasury presented an   unacceptable risk of reducing the System\\'s credibility and its ability   to conduct monetary policy effectively. He felt this risk was   particularly high in this instance. Moreover, as at the March 22,   1994, meeting of the Committee, he had serious concerns about the   appropriateness of the foreign exchange operations this particular   enlargement would support. In his view, the expansion of this   arrangement was equivalent in many respects to a fiscal policy   initiative of a kind that should be explicitly authorized by the   Congress.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be   held on Tuesday-Wednesday, January 31-February 1, 1995.The meeting adjourned at 12:45 p.m.Donald L.

Attended portions of the meeting.In the agenda for this meeting, it was reported that advices     of the election of the following members and alternate members of the     Federal Open Market Committee for the period commencing January 1,     1995, and ending December 31, 1995, had been received and that the     named individuals had executed their oaths of office.The elected members and alternate members were as follows:William J. McDonough, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New     York, with James H. Oltman, First Vice President of the Federal     Reserve Bank of New York, as alternate;Cathy E.

Vander Wilt Associate Economists By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was     selected to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account     until the adjournment of the first meeting of the Committee after     December 31, 1995. By unanimous vote, Peter R. Fisher was selected to serve at     the pleasure of the Committee as Manager, System Open Market Account,     on the understanding that his selection was subject to being     satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Secretary\\'s note: Advice subsequently was received       that the selection of Mr. Fisher was satisfactory to       the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of       New York.By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal     Open Market Committee held on December 20, 1994, were approved.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on     developments in foreign exchange markets since the December meeting.     There were no market transactions for System Account during this     period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.The Manager also reported on developments in domestic     financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period     December 20, 1994, through January 31, 1995. By unanimous vote, the     Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and     financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the     intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial     information available at the time of the meeting and of the     Committee\\'s discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic     policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the     Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested a strong     further rise in economic activity during the closing months of 1994.     Although consumer spending appeared to be less buoyant and housing     demand had softened somewhat, growth in business investment, exports,     and inventories remained brisk. Industrial production and payroll     employment continued to record substantial gains. Broad indexes of     prices for consumer goods and services had risen moderately on average     over recent months despite shrinking margins of unemployed resources     and further sizable increases in the prices of many materials.Nonfarm payroll employment advanced considerably further in     December after a sharp rise in November. Substantial job gains were     recorded in December in service industries and in the retail trade     sector. Hiring in manufacturing was brisk for a third straight month,     with labor demand especially strong in motor vehicles, capital goods,     and electronic equipment. Construction payrolls slipped after a large     increase in November. The average workweek was unchanged in December,     but factory overtime edged back up, matching the highest level reached     in the history of this series. The civilian unemployment rate     declined to 5.4 percent.Industrial production registered another large advance in     December. Manufacturing accounted for all of the gain; an upturn in     mining production offset a decline in the output of utilities     associated with unseasonably warm weather. In manufacturing, the     output of motor vehicles and parts surged again and further solid     gains were recorded in the production of other goods. The large     advance in industrial output in December boosted rates of capacity     utilization above already high levels.Retail sales were reported to have changed little over     November and December after substantial advances in September and     October; the flattening of sales reflected sharply reduced increases     in outlays for non-auto consumer goods. Consumer spending on services     rose moderately on balance over November and December, with outlays     for energy services held down by unusually mild weather. Although     some indicators of housing demand had weakened, housing starts posted     sizable gains on balance over November and December; single-family     construction remained at a relatively high level despite the rise in     mortgage rates in 1994, and multifamily construction continued its     gradual recovery from the depressed levels of early 1993. The     regional pattern of starts activity suggested that favorable weather     accounted for little of the strength in December.Business fixed investment was estimated to have grown at a     very rapid pace in the fourth quarter, with a pickup indicated for     business spending on both equipment and nonresidential structures.     New orders for nondefense capital goods declined on balance over     November and December, but the large backlog of unfilled orders,     especially for computers, pointed to a continued strong expansion in     spending on business equipment in coming months. Nonresidential     construction activity was up considerably in November for a third     straight month, with increases in construction widespread by type of     structure. Recent data indicated that permits for nonresidential     construction were continuing to trend higher and perhaps were running     ahead of construction activity.Business inventory investment remained brisk in November; in     the aggregate, the buildup was in line with shipments and sales. In     manufacturing, stocks increased more rapidly in November, but the     ratio of stocks to shipments declined further and was at a     historically low level. In wholesale trade, inventories rose less     rapidly in November, but the inventory-to-sales ratio increased     further, although it remained within its range of recent years.     Inventory accumulation slowed a little at the retail level, and the     inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained near the middle of     its range of recent years.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services     widened somewhat further in November, and for October and November     combined the deficit was well above its average rate in the third     quarter. The value of exports of goods and services increased more     slowly in the October-November period than in the third quarter,     largely reflecting reduced growth of exported industrial supplies.     The rise in the value of imports of goods and services for the     October-November period was led by increased imports of non-oil     industrial supplies and automotive, capital, and consumer goods.     Available data for the fourth quarter of 1994 indicated continued     growth in economic activity, though perhaps at a somewhat slower pace,     in the major foreign industrial countries.Consumer price inflation slowed a little in December despite     a jump in food prices that was only partly offset by a decline in     energy prices. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices edged     up in December and rose significantly less in 1994 than in 1993. At     the producer level, prices of finished goods also advanced more slowly     in December, with a drop in energy prices balancing a surge in food     prices. Prices of finished goods other than food and energy increased     modestly in 1994 after being held down in 1993 by a sharp drop in the     prices of tobacco products. In contrast to prices of finished goods,     price inflation at earlier stages of production picked up in 1994.     For intermediate goods other than food and energy items, prices rose     at a faster rate in the second half of 1994, with the pickup most     clearly evident in materials used in manufacturing. Prices of crude     materials rose rapidly in the second half of 1994 and for the year as     a whole. Increases in labor costs remained moderate. Average hourly     earnings were little changed on balance over November and December,     and for the year as a whole they advanced only slightly more than in     1993. More broadly, hourly compensation of private industry workers     increased more slowly in the fourth quarter than in any of the     previous three quarters of 1994, and the rise for the year was     significantly less than in 1993.At its meeting on December 20, 1994, the Committee adopted a     directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure     on reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible     firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period.     Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the     Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable     economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,     financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve     restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint     might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve     conditions associated with this directive were expected to be     consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary aggregates over     coming months.Open market operations during the intermeeting period were     directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve     positions. With the need for seasonal credit diminishing over the     period, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing trended lower but averaged     a little above anticipated levels. Near year-end, the Trading Desk     accommodated heavy demands for reserves through System RPs. The     federal funds rate averaged close to 5-1/2 percent during the     intermeeting period.Most other market interest rates declined slightly on balance     over the period after the December 20 meeting. Very short term     interest rates fell after the first of the year, reflecting the     disappearance of year-end premiums. More broadly, favorable news on     inflation and indications of some unexpected slowing in the growth of     final demands apparently led market participants to conclude that     further tightening of monetary policy, though still expected to be     substantial, would be less than previously thought and would be spread     over a longer period. Yields on tax-exempt instruments declined     considerably as concerns about the implications of Orange County\\'s     problems for the financial condition of other municipal governments     abated. Strong earning reports for the fourth quarter boosted major     indexes of equity prices.In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the     dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat over     the intermeeting period. The dollar fell substantially against the     mark, which was buoyed by safe-haven inflows from weaker European     currencies, but dropped less against the yen. One factor that weighed     against the dollar was uncertainty about the consequences for the U.S.     economy of the sharp depreciation of the Mexican peso and the related     economic and financial problems in Mexico and other developing     economies; market participants expressed some concern that the crisis     might constrain U.S. monetary policy in the event of further domestic     inflation pressures and that the counterpart to the large prospective     reduction in the Mexican current account deficit would lie importantly     in the already substantial U.S. deficit.Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December, and data for     the first half of January suggested a further acceleration in that     month. Much of the pickup in M2 in December was due to rapid     expansion in overnight repurchase agreements and overnight     Eurodollars, which outweighed a further contraction of liquid accounts     associated in part with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by     shifting funds into market instruments. The faster growth of M3     reflected, in addition to the acceleration of its M2 component, bank     use of large CDs and nondeposit sources of funds to finance relatively     robust demands for credit. From the fourth quarter of 1993 to the     fourth quarter of 1994, M2 grew at the lower end of the Committee\\'s     range for 1994 and M3 in the lower half of its range. Total domestic     nonfinancial debt had continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent     months, and for 1994 it was in the lower half of its monitoring range.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that     growth of economic activity would slow substantially over the next     several quarters and for some period thereafter would average less     than the rate of increase in the economy\\'s potential output. Consumer     spending was projected to be well sustained for a time but to be     restrained later by smaller gains in real incomes, the satisfaction of     pent-up demands, and the lagged effects of higher interest rates on     the demand for durable goods. Business outlays for new equipment were     expected to decelerate substantially in response to higher financing     costs and slower growth of sales and profits. Homebuilding was     anticipated to soften a little in response to slower growth in jobs     and income as well as to the increase that had occurred in mortgage     rates. Recent developments in Mexico were expected to cut into     exports in the near term, but the sustained economic growth elsewhere     would keep export demand on an uptrend. Although there was     considerable uncertainty regarding the fiscal outlook, in light of the     Congressional intent to cut the federal deficit the forecast     incorporated a somewhat greater degree of fiscal restraint than had     been built into recent forecasts. In the staff\\'s judgment, the     economy currently was operating beyond its long-run, noninflationary     capacity, and there remained a substantial risk that inflation could     ratchet higher absent further monetary policy actions.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective     economic developments, the members agreed that growth in economic     activity could be expected to moderate considerably over the course of     1995, although inflation was likely to be higher than in 1994. They     acknowledged that their current projections were subject to     substantial risks. The expansion continued to display appreciable     momentum and signs of slower growth were still quite limited and     tentative. Even so, the members remained persuaded that the lagged     effects of the policy tightening implemented over the course of 1994     would become increasingly evident in interest-sensitive sectors of the     economy as the year progressed. The projected moderation in the     growth of final demands, which probably would be concentrated at least     initially in the housing and consumer durables sectors, would     undoubtedly reinforce an expected cutback in inventory investment from     its unsustainable pace in recent quarters. A key uncertainty in the     outlook was whether the slowing in overall economic growth would be     sufficient to relieve the current pressures on labor and other     producer resources, which many members saw as portending higher     inflation, or, indeed, whether such pressures would intensify further.     Opinions differed to some degree with regard to both the likely extent     of the prospective slowing in economic growth and the outlook for     inflation. However, most of the members concluded that some rise in     inflation appeared probable over coming quarters, and they were     concerned that this upturn would not be reversed and could be extended     in the absence of further monetary restraint.In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee     establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt     aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank     presidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual     projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and     inflation for the year 1995. Measured from the fourth quarter of 1994     to the fourth quarter of 1995, their forecasts of the growth in real     GDP had a central tendency of 2 to 3 percent, compared with a growth     rate of 4 percent estimated for 1994. Most of the members also     anticipated that economic expansion in line with their forecasts would     be associated with little change in the unemployment rate and their     projections of the rate in the fourth quarter of 1995 were centered in     a narrow range around 5-1/2 percent. The high levels of resource     utilization implied by these projections were viewed by most members     as likely to foster somewhat greater pressure on wages and prices.     Accordingly, projections of the rate of inflation, as indexed by the     consumer price index, had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/2 percent for     the period from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of     1995, compared with rates of about 2-3/4 percent in both 1993 and     1994.In their review of regional economic developments, members     referred to widespread evidence of further growth in business     activity, but a number also mentioned scattered signs of some     softening in a few areas or industries. Several emphasized, however,     that the anecdotal evidence did not currently point to any significant     moderation in the overall growth of the economy. With regard to     financial conditions, members commented that they saw little     indication that policy tightening actions over the past year were     constraining the availability of credit to any observable degree.     Despite higher interest rates, financial conditions remained broadly     supportive of further economic expansion. The performance of stock     market prices and the relatively narrow quality spreads in debt     markets attested to a considerable degree of confidence among     investors. Members also took note of the accommodative lending     policies of banking institutions. Those policies had encouraged rapid     growth in consumer and business loans and evidently were contributing     to the ongoing strength of the economic expansion. Some members     expressed concern that a number of banks might have eased their     lending standards unduly and thus assumed unwarranted risks in their     loan portfolios.In their assessment of developments in key sectors of the     economy, members referred to the sluggish behavior of non-auto retail     sales in November and December, but they also noted that the available     information on consumer spending during the first few weeks of this     year was inconclusive with regard to the possible emergence of a     slowing trend. Anecdotal commentary on retail sales was mixed, and     evidence of some decline in January sales of motor vehicles needed to     be evaluated with caution because of the introduction of a new     reporting method. Consumer confidence was at a high level, but some     members observed that consumer indebtedness had grown rapidly and was     likely to exert a retarding effect on consumer spending at some point.     In this regard, however, it was pointed out that rising consumer     incomes had kept debt service burdens from increasing significantly     thus far. On balance, the members believed that the growth in     consumer spending probably would slow over the forecast horizon though     such spending might be relatively well maintained for some period,     given the ongoing expansion in jobs and incomes and the ready     availability of financing to many consumers. In any event, the     outlook for this sector of the economy, which was critical to any     significant moderation in overall economic growth, was uncertain with     regard to both the timing and the extent of possible slowing.Housing construction was cited as potentially the most     important demand sector of the economy that was likely to contribute     to more moderate economic growth over the year ahead. As evidenced by     nationwide data through the end of 1994, single-family housing starts     had held up unexpectedly well despite sizable increases in home     mortgage rates, but anecdotal reports from around the country had     pointed to weakening demand for new homes for several months and     continued to do so. Against the background of current mortgage rate     levels and the rise that had occurred in home mortgage indebtedness,     the members continued to anticipate softening demand for housing, at     least in the single-family sector. The mild uptrend in the much     smaller multifamily sector was likely to continue for some period,     given low rental vacancy rates in a number of areas, and further     improvement in nonresidential construction was likely to offset to     some extent the overall slowing in housing construction.In the capital goods sector, real business-fixed investment     had strengthened further in the fourth quarter, and the members     believed, on the basis of rising order backlogs and the strength of     permits for new business construction, that considerable momentum had     carried into this year. While the growth in spending for business     equipment undoubtedly would moderate from its extraordinary pace over     an extended period, large business profits and the still relatively     low user cost of capital would tend to support appreciable further     growth in such investment in the context of elevated levels of     capacity utilization and ongoing efforts, induced by strong market     competition, to increase productivity. Moreover, nonresidential     construction was now trending higher, with particular strength evident     in industrial and commercial construction.The pace of inventory accumulation in recent quarters was     viewed as unsustainable and a decline in inventory investment was seen     as likely over the forecast horizon, though the precise timing and     extent were impossible to predict. While slower growth in final     demand might in most circumstances stimulate a relatively sharp     adjustment in inventory investment, members cited factors that could     mute the size of that adjustment and its effects on overall GDP.     These included relatively low inventory/sales ratios across much of     the economy and little anecdotal or other evidence of unintended     inventory accumulation. Moreover, because an unusually large share of     the inventory buildup in recent quarters appeared to involve imports,     a cutback in such investment should tend to have a smaller-than-usual     impact on domestic production. There was no current evidence that     inventory investment was slowing, and indeed recent data on business     loans at banks might suggest some acceleration in inventory     accumulation since the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, as more     moderate growth in final demand began to emerge, concerns about the     availability of materials used in the production process or stocks     needed to meet market demand should diminish, and business firms could     be expected to trim their demand for inventories, perhaps aggressively     for a time. Indeed, this sector of the economy might well account for     much of the slowing in the expansion for some period of time during     the year ahead.Fiscal policy was under active debate in the Congress, and     the members viewed the outcome of that debate as very uncertain. The     emergence of a moderately restrictive fiscal policy might be a     reasonable assumption to incorporate in current forecasts, albeit an     assumption that clearly was subject to a wide range of error. In any     event, any progress toward cutting future budget deficits was likely     to have a favorable effect on domestic financial markets and perhaps     also on the dollar in foreign exchange markets.Developments in Mexico and their possible repercussions in     other developing nations had negative implications for U.S. exports,     at least over the short run. Indeed, some members cited anecdotal     evidence that reduced trade with Mexico had already emerged since late     1994. Moreover, the effects of the earthquake in Kobe, Japan, seemed     to be disrupting trade with that nation in agricultural and other bulk     goods and was likely to continue doing so over the near term. Looking     beyond the months immediately ahead, the relatively robust growth     projected for many industrial countries together with the lower value     of the dollar should boost the nation\\'s overall external trade     balance, though probably not to the extent of providing substantial     stimulus to the economy. One member observed that a number of     countries throughout the world faced the potential for important     changes in political conditions that could have adverse effects on     their growth and trading relationships, with possible repercussions on     U.S. exports.Members commented that the strong growth in economic activity     and high levels of resource utilization had fostered relatively rapid     increases in the prices of many raw materials and semi-finished goods     used in the production process, but contrary to numerous forecasts     these developments had not led thus far to a broad pickup in inflation     as measured by the prices of final goods and services. This favorable     development might be explained in part by lags in the inflation     transmission process and perhaps to some degree by various structural     changes and productivity improvements in recent years that may have     raised both the level and the rate of increase of the economy\\'s     potential for sustained activity. Many members observed, however,     that it would not be prudent from a monetary policy standpoint to     assume that continued rapid economic growth and further pressures on     producer resources would not lead to rising inflation over the     quarters ahead. While competitive pressures still generally limited     the extent to which business firms could pass through rising costs of     raw materials and other producer inputs to the prices of final goods,     the members referred to increasingly numerous examples of successful     efforts to raise such prices and to apparently growing business     expectations that it would be possible to implement such increases     over the months ahead. On balance, the members generally were     persuaded that the economy had attained levels of labor and capital     utilization that implied a strong risk of rising inflation over coming     quarters.In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and     Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee     at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and     debt aggregates in 1995 that it had established on a tentative basis     at its meeting in July 1994. The tentative ranges included expansion     of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3, measured from the     fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The monitoring     range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set     provisionally at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The ranges for M2 and M3     were unchanged from those that the Committee had used in 1994, while     the range for debt was one percentage point lower.All the members endorsed a proposal to adopt the ranges that     the Committee had set on a tentative basis in July 1994. While some     acceleration in the growth of the broad monetary aggregates from the     pace in 1994 could be anticipated over the year ahead according to a     staff analysis, monetary expansion within the ranges in question     appeared to be consistent with the moderation in the expansion of     nominal GDP that the members were projecting for 1995 and that they     viewed as desirable to head off increasing inflation. Moreover, the     ranges for the broad monetary aggregates had been reduced over the     past decade to levels that, notably in the case of M2, should now be     consistent over long periods with the Committee\\'s objectives for     stable prices and maximum sustainable economic growth. This outcome     would depend on the restoration over time of the historical velocity     patterns linking the monetary aggregates to broad measures of economic     performance, including a level velocity trend for M2. It was noted in     this regard that until recent years the growth of M3 had tended to     exceed that of M2--a pattern that seemed to be re-emerging--and     therefore a somewhat higher range might be set for M3 than for M2.     However, the members did not believe that a persuasive argument could     be made at this juncture for raising the M3 range, though they did not     want to rule out the option of doing so later, possibly when the     ranges were reviewed at midyear. Indeed, to make the change at this     point might convey a misleading message regarding the Committee\\'s     policy intentions or its confidence in prospective monetary growth     relationships.The Committee also considered the potential advantages and     disadvantages of setting specific targets for bringing inflation down     and achieving price stability over time. Such targets might provide     an alternative or supplemental approach to the monetary growth ranges,     which had been found to be unreliable guides for monetary policy over     the past several years. The members discussed a number of aspects of     inflation targeting. On the one hand, such targeting would help to     anchor the conduct of monetary policy and progress in meeting these     objectives could enhance the credibility of the Federal Reserve and     perhaps reduce the overall cost of attaining price stability. On the     other hand, close adherence to preset inflation targets could unduly     constrain the Federal Reserve in its efforts to counteract the effects     of cyclical shortfalls in the performance of the economy. The members     agreed that the discussion had been helpful in outlining the issues     and that the subject should be revisited. It was noted in this     connection that the Committee might be asked to comment during the     months ahead on specific Congressional proposals for inflation     targeting.At the conclusion of its discussion, all the members voted to     approve without change the tentative ranges for 1995 that the     Committee had established in July of last year. In keeping with its     usual procedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would     review its ranges at midyear, or sooner if interim conditions     warranted, in light of the growth and velocity behavior of the     aggregates and ongoing economic and financial developments.     Accordingly, the following longer-run policy statement for 1995 was     approved for inclusion in the domestic policy directive.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary       and financial conditions that will foster price       stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In       furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this       meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of       1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively,       measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth       quarter of 1995. The Committee anticipated that money       growth within these ranges would be consistent with its       broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for       growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered       to 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the       monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in       the light of progress toward price level stability,       movements in their velocities, and developments in the       economy and financial markets.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,       McDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, LaWare,       Lindsey, Melzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow,       Mses. Phillips and Yellen.Votes against this action: None.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting     period ahead, all the members indicated that they could support some     firming in reserve conditions, though a few preferred to delay such an     action pending the receipt within the next few weeks of significant     new information that could help the Committee to evaluate whether and     to what extent the economic expansion might be slowing. Most of the     members were convinced, however, that current monetary policy should     be adjusted promptly to a more clearly restrictive stance. In their     view, prompt action was needed to counter inflationary pressures and     inflationary expectations in an economy that already seemed to be     operating at, and perhaps beyond, sustainable capacity levels and to     be continuing to expand at a pace above its long-run potential. In     these circumstances, a delay in tightening policy would incur an     unacceptable risk of allowing further inflationary momentum to develop     in the economy and would require more tightening over time than might     otherwise be needed to achieve the Committee\\'s objectives. Part of     the risk involved a potential further decline in the dollar at a time     when there already was considerable concern about rising pressures on     prices. Some tightening of policy at this meeting was generally     anticipated in markets, and a failure to take action now was likely in     the view of a number of members to raise questions about the     credibility of the System\\'s anti-inflation resolve and to generate     some unsettlement in financial markets, notably in the foreign     exchange market where the dollar already appeared to be vulnerable to     further weakness. In terms of balancing the policy risks that were     involved, a prompt move would provide some insurance against what     these members viewed as the principal risk in current circumstances--that of rising inflation. The risks of excessive tightening, while     not completely absent, were believed to be limited in light of the apparent strength and momentum of the expansion, which many     forecasters had underestimated over the past year. One member     expressed the view that while monetary growth had been damped,     continuing restraint on the growth of the narrow monetary aggregates     was desirable to offset a previous build-up in liquidity and help     assure that inflationary pressures would be contained.Members who saw an advantage in postponing a decision to     tighten policy commented that, in light of some scattered signs of a     moderating expansion, it would be helpful to wait for certain key     statistics that would become available within the next few weeks to     judge the extent of any moderation. Data on retail sales in January     might provide particular insights as to whether the softening in such     sales in November and December was persisting. The favorable news on     inflation in the fourth quarter had lessened concerns about an     immediate inflation threat, and if the incoming information confirmed     the need for further tightening, the short delay in implementing it     would have only a minimal cost. In addition, an increase in monetary     restraint would be likely to exacerbate the problems of Mexico and     perhaps to some extent those of Canada and would have potentially     adverse implications for U.S. trade with both of these key trading     partners. Because the probability that incoming information would     counsel against any further policy tightening was certainly less than     50 percent so that only a matter of timing was likely to be involved,     these members indicated that they would join with the other members in     voting to tighten policy at this meeting.Concerning the possible need to adjust policy during the     intermeeting period, the members were unanimously in favor of adopting     a symmetric directive. Given a decision to implement some tightening     in monetary policy at this meeting, they did not believe that there     should be a presumption toward possible further tightening in this     period. A number of members observed that further monetary restraint     might not be needed if, in line with their expectations, the incoming     evidence on the performance of the economy suggested that the     expansion was moderating sufficiently for the economy to return to a     growth path consistent with containing inflation pressures. In any     event, the Committee\\'s most difficult decision over the next several     quarters was likely to be that of determining when further tightening     was no longer desirable.Prior to the end of the meeting, the members were apprised of     a disposition on the part of the Board of Governors to approve an     increase of 1/2 percentage point in the discount rate that was pending     at several Federal Reserve Banks. In the event that such an increase     was approved by the Board, the members agreed that open market     operations should be conducted so as to allow that increase to be     reflected fully in reserve markets.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all the     members indicated that they could support a directive that called for     increasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions. In     the implementation of this policy, account would be taken of a     possible increase of 1/2 percentage in the discount rate that was     under consideration by the Board of Governors. The members also     agreed that the directive should not include any presumption about     possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period.     Accordingly, in the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for     price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful     consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the     Committee decided that somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve     restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period.     According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at     this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3     over coming months.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of     New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by     the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in     accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting       suggests a strong further rise in economic activity       during the closing months of 1994. Nonfarm payroll       employment was up considerably further in December       after a sharp increase in November, and the       civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.4 percent.       Industrial production registered another large       advance in December and capacity utilization       continued to move up from already high levels.       Current estimates indicate little change in retail       sales over November and December, while housing       starts posted sizable gains on balance over the two       months. Orders for nondefense capital goods point       to a continued strong expansion in spending on       business equipment; permits for nonresidential       construction have been trending appreciably higher.       The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and       services widened somewhat in October-November from       its average rate in the third quarter. Prices of       many materials have continued to move up rapidly,       but broad indexes of prices for consumer goods and       services have increased moderately on average over       recent months.Most market interest rates have declined       slightly on balance since the Committee meeting on       December 20, 1994. In foreign exchange markets,       the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of       the other G-10 currencies has declined somewhat       over the intermeeting period. The Mexican peso has       depreciated sharply against the dollar.Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December       and January. From the fourth quarter of 1993 to       the fourth quarter of 1994, M2 grew at a rate at       the bottom of the Committee\\'s range for 1994 and M3       at a rate in the lower half of its range for the       year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has       continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent       months, and for the year 1994 it grew at a rate in       the lower half of its monitoring range.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks       monetary and financial conditions that will foster       price stability and promote sustainable growth in       output. In furtherance of these objectives, the       Committee at this meeting established ranges for       growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4       percent respectively, measured from the fourth       quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The       Committee anticipated that money growth within       these ranges would be consistent with its broad       policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth       of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to       3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the       monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated       in the light of progress toward price level       stability, movements in their velocities, and       developments in the economy and financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the       immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase       somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve       positions, taking account of a possible increase in       the discount rate. In the context of the       Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability       and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful       consideration to economic, financial, and monetary       developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint or       somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be       acceptable in the intermeeting period. The       contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be       consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over       coming months.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,       McDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, LaWare,       Lindsey, Melzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow,       Mses. Phillips and Yellen.Votes against this action: None.Temporary Increase in Reciprocal Currency Agreement with the Bank of     Mexico and Increase in Agreement to \"Warehouse\" Foreign CurrenciesOn December 30, 1994, the Committee approved a temporary     increase from $3 billion to $4-1/2 billion in the System\\'s reciprocal     currency (swap) agreement with the Bank of Mexico and it also approved     the activation of that agreement. The Committee approved a further     temporary increase of $1-1/2 billion and activation of that amount at     this meeting, thereby raising the swap arrangement with the Bank of     Mexico to a level of $6 billion, consisting of the regular $3 billion     line and a special $3 billion line. The special $3 billion line may     be drawn on until January 31, 1996. Drawings would be for three-month     periods and could be renewed a maximum of three times. Once a drawing     on the special line is repaid, the size of the line will be reduced     pari passu. All drawings on the special line will have to be repaid     no later than January 31, 1997. The terms and conditions for use of     the permanent $3 billion swap facility with the Bank of Mexico remain     unchanged and drawings, once repaid, will require Committee action     prior to subsequent use. The Treasury has undertaken to assure the     repayment of any swap drawing by the Bank of Mexico on the $6 billion     in lines that is outstanding more than 12 months. Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,       McDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, LaWare,       Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips and       Yellen.Votes against this action: Messrs.       Lindsey and Melzer.The Committee also approved at this meeting an increase from     $5 billion to $20 billion in the amount of eligible foreign currencies     that the System is prepared to \"warehouse\" for the Treasury and the     Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The purpose of the warehousing     facility, which has been in place for many years, is to supplement the U.S. dollar resources of the Treasury and the ESF for financing     purchases of foreign currencies and related international operations.     The size of the warehousing facility had ranged up to $15 billion in     past years, but it was reduced to $5 billion in February 1992. The     expansion of the warehousing agreement at this meeting was intended to     facilitate U.S. participation in the Multilateral Program to Restore     Financial Stability in Mexico, announced by President Clinton on     January 31, 1995, by warehousing up to $20 billion in German marks and     Japanese yen held by the Treasury through the ESF. The Committee will     review each year the need to maintain this level of warehousing     authority in light of the progress and needs of the Program.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,       McDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, LaWare,       Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips and       Yellen.Votes against this action: Messrs.       Lindsey and Melzer.Members who voted to approve these proposals were persuaded     that the nature and severity of Mexico\\'s financial problems could not     be contained without making available substantial financial assistance     to the Government of Mexico. The financial support provided by the     United States would be accompanied by similar assistance from the IMF     and would be conditioned on Mexico\\'s commitment to implement major     changes in its economic policies, including monetary policy. It was     emphasized during the Committee\\'s discussion that the United States     had a strong interest in encouraging the restoration of stability in     Mexico for numerous reasons, including the growth of trade between the     two nations and the resulting creation of jobs in both countries.     Moreover, Mexico\\'s financial problems appeared to be spreading to a     number of other nations and adversely affecting the dollar in the     foreign exchange markets. The participation of the Federal Reserve in     this effort was strongly endorsed by the Administration and the     overall program had the support of the bipartisan leadership in the     Congress. Apart from temporary financial resources, the Federal     Reserve was in a position to supply expertise and experience that were     not readily available elsewhere. On the negative side, the members     acknowledged that there could be no assurances that the rescue program     would succeed, but its scale, its multinational character, and the     apparent willingness of Mexican officials to pursue the difficult     policies needed to assure success were grounds for optimism.Messrs. Lindsey and Melzer dissented with respect to     increases in both the swap line and the warehousing arrangement with     the Exchange Stabilization Fund. They did not believe that the     Committee had been provided sufficient information to assess whether     developments in Mexico threatened U.S. financial stability, a possible     justification for increased central bank lending on a short-term     basis, Furthermore, they considered it inappropriate for the Federal     Reserve to participate, directly or indirectly, in intermediate to     long-term financing to facilitate debt restructuring. They were     concerned that such participation in a fiscal policy matter might     compromise, or appear to compromise, the independence of the monetary     policy process. Mr. Lindsey added that the latter risks were     significantly enhanced given the absence of Congressional     authorization or more general public support for these measures.Disclosure Policy.At this meeting, the Committee decided to retain the procedures that it had followed over the past year for providing greater     information to the public about its policy actions and discussions.     It was the judgment of the members that these procedures strike an     appropriate balance between making the Committee\\'s decisions and     deliberations accessible to the public as soon and as fully as     feasible, while safeguarding the Committee\\'s flexibility in policymaking and preserving an unfettered deliberative process. The     procedures in question involve the prompt announcement of the     Committee\\'s decisions and the release of minutes and transcripts of     FOMC meetings.The Committee will continue its practice of announcing each     change in the stance of monetary policy in a press release on the day     the decision is made. This practice removes any uncertainty about the     Committee\\'s intentions in regard to reserve conditions and enables all     financial market participants and others to receive the information at     the same time. When no change is made at a meeting, the Committee     normally will announce only the time when the meeting ended and that     there are no further announcements. However, in some infrequent     circumstances, the Committee may decide to issue a statement even when     no change in policy is made.The full substance of the Committee\\'s deliberations relating     to each policy decision will continue to be reported, as is the     current practice, in comprehensive minutes of the meeting that are     released two or three days following the next regularly scheduled     meeting. For historians and other students of monetary policymaking,     those minutes will be supplemented by lightly edited transcripts of     the discussion at each Committee meeting. For recent and future     meetings, transcripts for an entire year will be released with a five-year lag; earlier transcripts dating back to March 1976 will continue     to be released on an ongoing basis as the light editing process is     completed. Continuing the practice followed since the beginning of     1994, transcripts prepared by the Committee\\'s Secretariat will be     circulated to each participant to verify his or her comments, and only     changes that clarify meaning, such as the correction of grammar or     transcription errors, will be permitted. A limited amount of material     will be withheld from the publicly released version of these     documents, primarily to protect the confidentiality of foreign and     domestic sources of information that likely would be lost if the     information they provide were to be made public. As required by law,     a complete, unredacted version of the transcript of each meeting will     be turned over to the National Archives after 30 years have elapsed.For the purpose of preparing the minutes and transcripts, the     discussions of monetary policy at Committee meetings will continue to     be recorded. The tape recorder may be turned off at the Chairman\\'s     discretion when the Committee deals with issues unrelated to monetary     policy, such as organizational and personnel matters. The transcripts     will indicate that the tape recorder has been turned off and the     minutes will provide a summary description of the matters that were     discussed, As permitted by the National Records Act, the recordings     and unedited transcripts will be discarded after all the participants     at the meeting have reviewed and corrected, as necessary, the     transcripts prepared by the Secretariat.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would     be held on Tuesday, March 28, 1995.The meeting adjourned at 3:20 p.m.Donald L.

The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the     Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to     the extent necessary to carry out the Committee\\'s foreign currency     directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant     thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the     Committee may issue from time to time:A.

To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw       dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph       2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such       arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any       amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee,       because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies       not exceeding $25.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open       position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding       signs) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in       a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that       currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus       outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as       the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve     Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (\"swap\"     arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a     maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among     those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve     System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign     Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew     such arrangements on maturity:Foreign bank Amount of arrangement                 (millions of dollars equivalent)Austrian National Bank\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0250National Bank of Belgium1,000Bank of Canada2,000National Bank of Denmark\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0250Bank of England3,000Bank of France2,000German Federal Bank6,000Bank of Italy3,000Bank of Japan5,000Bank of MexicoRegular3,000Special3,000Netherlands Bank\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0500Bank of Norway\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0250Bank of Sweden\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0300Swiss National Bank4,000Bank for International Settlements:Dollars against Swiss francs600Dollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs1,250Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the     proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall   be referred for review and approval to the Committee.3.

It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central     banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In     making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System     holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York     shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless     authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or     understandings concerning the administration of the accounts     maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign     banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of     Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the     Committee.5.

All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs     shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and     the Committee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the     Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the     Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman     may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on     the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as     alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee,     his alternate).

System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be     directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that     market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior     consistent with the IMF Article IV, Section 1.2. To achieve this end the System shall:A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign       exchange.B. Maintain reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with       selected foreign central banks and with the Bank for International       Settlements.C.

All operations undertaken pursuant to     such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the     Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the     Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s       overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on       any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the       Committee.B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the       System\\'s net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150       million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with       repayment of swap drawings.C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of       trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change       in the System\\'s net position in that currency might be less than the       limits specified in 1.B.D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the       larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap       arrangement.2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the     Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the     full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the     Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the     Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s       overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion       since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the       larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap       arrangement.3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the     Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any     operations that are not of a routine character.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on     developments in foreign exchange markets and on System open market     transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 1, 1995,     through March 27, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified     these transactions.The Manager also reported on developments in domestic     financial markets and on System open market transactions in government     securities and federal agency obligations during the period February     1, 1995, through March 27, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee     ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic     and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over     the intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and     financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the     Committee\\'s discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic     policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the     Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the     expansion of economic activity had moderated considerably in early     1995. Slower growth in consumer spending, associated in part with a     sharp decline in expenditures for motor vehicles, and weakness in     housing purchases were factors in the moderation. Despite signs of     some weakening in final demand, however, further sizable gains had     been recorded in industrial production and payroll employment, and     overall rates of resource utilization remained high. Broad indexes of     consumer and producer prices had risen more rapidly on average over     January and February, but wages had shown no sign of an acceleration.Nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably over     January and February, although the average monthly advance was     somewhat smaller than that of 1994. Further brisk job gains were     recorded in the January-February period in manufacturing; hiring in     retail and wholesale trade and in the service-producing sector slowed     a bit; and construction payrolls changed little on balance. The     average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers remained at a     high level over the two months. The civilian unemployment rate rose     in January but fell back in February to its December level of 5.4     percent.The expansion in industrial production also moderated in     January and February from the rapid pace of last year. Manufacturing     production grew less rapidly, with output gains down sharply in     February for consumer durable goods and construction supplies. Mining     production continued to be sluggish. By contrast, the output of     utilities surged during the January-February period as winter     temperatures, which had been unusually warm, moved back toward normal,     Capacity utilization rates, which were little changed over the first     two months of the year, remained high.Retail sales fell in February, reversing most of a sizable     rise in January. The February declines in sales were widespread, with     slippage evident at most types of retail outlets. Most indicators of     housing activity had weakened in recent months in lagged response to     the earlier rise in mortgage interest rates. Housing starts fell     sharply in January and edged still lower in February; these declines     more than erased the gains that had been posted on balance over the     closing months of 1994. A substantial drop in sales of existing homes     in January (latest data) extended the trend that had been evident for     some months.Shipments of nondefense capital goods recorded another     strong advance in February. Shipments of office and computing     equipment rebounded in February from declines in December and January,     and demand for most other types of equipment remained brisk. Business     outlays for heavy trucks fell back slightly in February after a surge     in January. While there were tentative signs in the recent orders     data of some deceleration in business equipment spending, the still-growing backlog of unfilled orders suggested further solid expansion     in business spending on equipment. Nonresidential construction     activity had been trending appreciably higher over the past two years;     however, a slowdown in spending by public utilities in December and     January, in an environment of uncertainty related to pending     deregulation, and a third straight monthly decline in permit issuance     for nonresidential structures in February pointed to some softening in     the uptrend.Business inventory investment surged in January after a     slowdown in December; excluding a large increase in stocks of motor     vehicles at the wholesale and retail levels, inventories rose in     January at about the average rate of the final three quarters of 1994.     In manufacturing, inventory accumulation outpaced sales in January;     the stocks-to-sales ratio edged higher but was still near historical     lows. At wholesale establishments, inventory accumulation picked up     in January as a large rise in automotive inventories more than offset     a reduced increase in stocks of other goods. The inventory-to-sales     ratio for the sector moved higher in January but remained well within     its range of the last several years. At the retail level, inventories     jumped in January after a slight decline in December; almost all the     rise reflected increased stocks of motor vehicles. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector as a whole was unchanged in January     and remained near the middle of its range of recent years, at     automotive dealerships, the inventory-to-sales ratio rose sharply     while elsewhere the ratio edged lower.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services     widened sharply in January from its December level and its average     rate in the fourth quarter; some of the increase in the deficit was     due to trade with Mexico, but somewhat distorted seasonal adjustment     factors also may have been involved. The value of exports of goods     and services declined substantially in January after having increased     strongly in November and December. The value of imports rose     considerably in January, continuing the pattern of the fourth quarter.     The export losses and import gains in January were distributed widely     across major trade categories. The pace of economic recovery in the     major foreign industrial countries appeared to have moderated in     recent months. In the fourth quarter, economic activity declined in     Japan and grew more slowly in most of the other major industrial     countries; growth had picked up in Canada. Available data suggested     that in the first quarter economic expansion had slowed in all of the     major foreign industrial countries except Japan, where growth appeared     to be positive despite the Kobe earthquake.Consumer price increases in January and February were a     little larger than the average monthly rise in 1994. Food prices were     unchanged on balance over the two-month period, while energy prices     were up only slightly. Producer prices of finished goods increased in     January and February at the same rate as consumer prices; producer     price inflation for the two months also was higher than in 1994, with     a steep rise in gasoline prices in January contributing to the pickup.     Producer prices of intermediate materials surged in the first two     months of this year after having accelerated sharply in the second     half of 1994. Average hourly earnings of private production or     nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in February after a substantial     rise in January. For the two months combined, hourly earnings     increased at about the same average monthly pace as in 1994.At its meeting on January 31-February 1, 1995, the Committee     adopted a directive that called for increasing somewhat the existing     degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible     rise of 1/2 percentage point in the discount rate. The directive     approved by the Committee did not include a presumption about the     likely direction of any further adjustments to policy during the     intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the     context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and     sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to     economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater or     somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the     intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this     directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2     and M3 over coming months.On the second day of the meeting, the Board of Governors     approved an increase of one-half percentage point in the discount     rate, to 5-1/4 percent. The rise was made effective immediately and     was passed through fully to interest rates in reserve markets. Open     market operations during the intermeeting period were conducted with a     view to maintaining the tighter policy stance adopted at the meeting     and implemented immediately thereafter. The federal funds rate     averaged a little less than 6 percent over the intermeeting interval,     and adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was a little below anticipated     levels.Financial market participants generally had expected a     firming in reserve market conditions, and consequently market interest     rates showed little immediate reaction. Subsequently, most market     interest rates declined considerably in response to both incoming data     that were seen as indicating an appreciable slowing in the pace of     economic expansion and statements by Federal Reserve officials that     were viewed as suggesting that the period of monetary policy     tightening might be coming to a close. The largest declines in yields     were concentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations.     Stronger-than-expected earnings reports coupled with heightened     prospects for sustained, moderate economic expansion and continued low     inflation boosted major indexes of equity prices to record levels.In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the     dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell substantially     further. The dollar\\'s decline was particularly sharp against the     Japanese yen and the German mark, and post-World War II record lows     against these two currencies were recorded. Declines in U.S. interest     rates and concerns about the persistence of large U.S. trade and     fiscal deficits appeared to have contributed to the dollar\\'s drop.     Continuing economic and financial problems in Mexico, which resulted     in further depreciation on balance of the Mexican peso against the     dollar, also seemed to add to negative sentiment toward the dollar     because the process of adjustment in the Mexican economy to the lower     value of the peso was viewed as implying reduced imports from and     increased exports to the United States.M2 declined, and growth of M3 slowed in February after     sizable January gains; data for the first part of March pointed to     some recovery in both aggregates. M2\\'s weakness in February partly     reflected an unwinding of temporary increases in January of its     volatile components, including demand deposits, overnight repurchase     agreements, and overnight Eurodollars; the weakness also appeared to     be associated with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by     shifting funds into market instruments. The slowdown in growth of M3     in February was entirely attributable to the decline in M2; its non-M2     component increased substantially further as banks continued to rely     heavily on managed liabilities to fund loan growth. Expansion of     total domestic nonfinancial debt had picked up a little in recent     months.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that     growth of economic activity was slowing and for some period ahead     would average a little less than the rate of increase in the economy\\'s     potential output. The pace of the expansion seemed to have slackened     somewhat more than had been anticipated at the last meeting; however,     the recent declines in long-term interest rates and the rally in stock     prices were expected to provide additional support for aggregate     demand later in the year. Moreover, the substantial depreciation of     the dollar against the yen and several European currencies was acting     to offset some of the effects on demand of the previous tightening of     reserve conditions. The forecast continued to anticipate that in the     period ahead consumer spending would be restrained by smaller gains in     real incomes, the substantial degree to which pent-up demands had been     satisfied, and the lagged effects of earlier increases in interest     rates on the demand for durable goods. Business outlays for new     equipment would decelerate substantially in response to slower growth     of sales and profits. Homebuilding was projected to decline somewhat     further in the near term and to remain at somewhat subdued levels for     a time in reflection of the damping effects on housing demand of     slower growth in jobs and incomes and of the earlier rise in mortgage     rates. Developments in Mexico were likely to interrupt only briefly a     strong uptrend in U.S. exports, based on sustained growth in the     economies of other U.S. trading partners. Considerable uncertainty     continued to surround the federal fiscal outlook but, as in the     previous forecast, a moderate pace of deficit reduction was assumed     over the forecast horizon. In the staff\\'s judgment, the economy was     operating beyond its long-run, noninflationary capacity, and there     remained a risk that higher inflation could emerge if the expansion     did not moderate sufficiently.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective     economic developments, the members agreed that the pace of the     economic expansion was moderating, though the extent of the slowdown     was not yet clear. The effects of the policy tightening implemented     since early 1994 seemed to be showing through in interest-sensitive     sectors, and those effects were expected to be reinforced by some     cutback in inventory accumulation from the unsustainable rates of     previous quarters. Quarters of fairly slow growth were not unusual in     a period of expansion. On the whole, however, the economy appeared to     retain considerable forward momentum, with current imbalances     seemingly of a relatively minor nature and in the process of being     corrected. Moreover, the recent declines in long-term interest rates,     if these persisted, could provide fresh support for interest-sensitive     spending later in 1995 and in 1996. While opinions differed somewhat     with respect to both the likely extent of the slowdown and the     prognosis for inflation, the members generally agreed that the economy     appeared to be on a trajectory toward a more sustainable path for     economic activity. However, a number of members expressed concern     that the slowdown might not be sufficient to relieve the persisting     pressures on labor and capital resources, thereby portending higher     inflation.In the course of the Committee\\'s discussion, members     reported on widespread signs that business activity, while still quite     strong in many areas, was growing less rapidly on balance. Still, a     number of factors pointed to continued solid expansion. Business     sentiment was generally described as quite positive, though somewhat     less ebullient than in earlier months. Likewise, recent surveys     suggested that consumer confidence remained very favorable, though     down slightly from recent peaks by most measures. In addition to the     favorable recent developments in financial markets, bank lending     policies remained quite accommodative, although business loan growth     had slowed recently after a period of unusual strength.In their review of developments in key sectors of the     economy, members took note of the sluggishness in consumer spending     that had emerged in recent months in much of the country. To a     considerable extent the recent weakness reflected a sharp reduction in     spending for motor vehicles, but there also were signs in the most     recent data of broader declines in spending, especially for durable     goods other than automobiles. Some reduction in spending for durable     goods could be expected in lagged response to the policy tightening     over the past year, but a few members noted that unusual weather might     have led to the temporary postponement of some discretionary     purchases. In assessing the recent spending patterns, it was     difficult to determine whether they represented a temporary pause or a     more prolonged pullback by consumers. On balance, however, growth in     consumer spending probably would slow somewhat further to a rate more     in line with the expansion in jobs and incomes. Consumer spending     would tend to be sustained, however, by the ready availability of     consumer financing and the rise in bond and stock prices, which had     strengthened household balance sheets and perhaps was helping to     bolster consumer confidence.The housing market had weakened noticeably according to     incoming data and anecdotal reports from around the country. The     decline in home sales that began in the latter part of 1994 had     persisted, and housing starts had fallen sharply in the early part of     the year as a consequence of the weaker sales and a larger inventory     of unsold homes. Partly because of the higher mortgage rates that had     prevailed for some time, members anticipated still soft housing     demand, particularly for single-family houses. There had been some     reports that recent declines in mortgage interest rates were having a     mitigating effect. In some parts of the country, the weakness in     housing construction was being countered by further improvement in     nonresidential construction activity. In other areas where commercial     real estate conditions remained soft, declines in vacancy rates seemed     to be preparing the way for a pickup in commercial building activity.Committee members anticipated that growth of business     investment in plant and equipment would moderate from the     extraordinary rate of the last two years but that such investment     would continue to support growth in aggregate final demand during the     forecast period. The demand for durable equipment was expected to     increase more gradually as the growth of economic activity slowed and     business profits tended to flatten out, and the available data on     equipment expenditures thus far in 1995 appeared to be in line with     that expectation. However, some anecdotal reports suggested that     investment in plant and equipment might be stronger than expected in     an environment of tight labor supply and elevated levels of capacity     utilization, intense desires to control costs and improve     competitiveness, and a still relatively low user cost of capital. The     desire for additional production capacity was reflected in spending     for the construction of commercial and industrial structures, which     remained on an uptrend.The rapid rise in business inventories in recent quarters     had been sustainable in the context of briskly increasing final sales,     but with some further accumulation early in the first quarter and     economic growth projected to moderate, the rate of inventory     investment would have to adjust downward as well. While the timing     and extent could not be anticipated with any precision, a short-term     inventory correction process might already be under way, with firms     initiating cutbacks to production schedules to reflect smaller-than-expected gains in sales over recent months. Members noted that     inventory-to-sales ratios already were at generally low levels and     they anticipated that any desired adjustments to production would be     made quickly. In the circumstances, the size of the inventory     correction and its effect on economic activity would be limited.     Moreover, reports of inventory shortages in some industries suggested     that many firms might raise their desired inventory levels to protect     against shortfalls in materials needed in the production process.The defeat of the balanced budget amendment in Congress had     clouded the outlook for deficit reduction. Nonetheless, a moderately     restrictive fiscal policy that would provide for some progress toward     a balanced budget during the forecast period was seen as a reasonable     assumption. One member observed that there was a risk of a more     restrictive fiscal policy arising out of the dynamics of the current     political debate. In any event, any progress toward a balanced budget     might be expected to have a favorable effect on domestic financial     markets and perhaps also on the dollar in foreign exchange markets.Members commented that considerable uncertainty surrounded     the outlook for the external sector, but for now it seemed reasonable     to forecast that this sector would make a small positive contribution,     on balance, to the growth of economic activity over the forecast     period. In the near term, economic developments in Mexico were     leading to lower U.S. exports and higher imports; anecdotal reports     suggested that the effects on trade flows and local business activity     tended to be felt most strongly in states that border Mexico.     However, there were signs that conditions were stabilizing in Mexico,     and more generally the relatively robust growth projected for the     major trading partners of the United States and the lower value of the     dollar now prevailing were expected to foster improvement in the     nation\\'s trade balance.Members noted that while the pace of the expansion evidently     had slowed, economic activity and utilization of labor and other     producer resources were still at very high levels. Prices of many     materials inputs to the production process had risen sharply, but thus     far there had been only a small pickup in consumer prices. Likewise,     the persisting tightness in many labor markets had not to this point     fostered appreciable increases in wages. The absence of a significant     rise in prices of finished goods or in wages might reflect in some     measure the lags in the inflation transmission process, the fruits of     heavy business investments in new capacity and more productive     equipment in recent years, and perhaps structural changes in business     organization that were raising the economy\\'s capacity for sustained,     noninflationary activity. Members were concerned, however, that     despite continuing competitive pressures and some recent abatement in     materials prices, business firms were reporting greater success in     passing cost increases through to prices. The depreciation of the     dollar also would add to inflationary pressures in the economy. In     these circumstances, the members generally concluded that some     increase in inflation was likely in coming months.In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the     intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to     maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The     policy tightening that had been implemented since early 1994 appeared     to be exerting a desired restraining effect on the growth of economic     activity and associated demands for goods and services. But the     extent of the slowing in growth and its effects on inflationary     pressures were not yet clear. On balance, though, the available     evidence tended to suggest that the economy might be moving toward a     growth path for economic activity that would be consistent with     limiting the uptick in inflation that was currently being experienced.     In discussing their policy choices, several members noted the     relatively steep decline in the value of the dollar. However, they     believed that policy should not be directed toward the achievement of     a specific level for the dollar but rather toward the implementation     of an effective anti-inflationary monetary policy, taking account of     all the factors bearing on the economic outlook. In current     circumstances, and given the substantial uncertainties that were     involved, the members believed that it would be prudent to pause and     assess developments before taking any further policy action.With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the     intermeeting period, most members expressed a preference for an     asymmetric directive tilted toward restraint. These members indicated     that near-term developments were not likely to call for an adjustment     to policy in either direction. Nonetheless, with the economy expected     to be operating in the neighborhood of its potential, the recent rise     in inflation and the risk of an unexpected impulse that could ratchet     inflation even higher suggested that an asymmetric directive would be     more consistent with the Committee\\'s objective of moving over time     toward price stability. The economy retained considerable forward     momentum and, as had often happened in the past, the recent slowdown     in growth could prove to be temporary, with additional monetary     tightening needed at some point to contain inflation. In this     connection a few members indicated that further tightening might well     be needed sooner rather than later. An asymmetric directive also     would provide a clear signal of the Committee\\'s intention to resist     higher inflation.A few members preferred a symmetric directive. These     members agreed that additional policy tightening might be needed if     inflation began to pick up. However, they saw an undesirably weaker     economic performance as being about equally likely, and in their view     this balance in the risks to the outlook called for the adoption of a     symmetric directive. The Committee\\'s determination to keep inflation     under control would be appropriately conveyed, in their view, through     future actions rather than through the adoption of a tilt toward     restraint. However, these members indicated that they could accept an     asymmetric intermeeting instruction.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all the     members indicated that they preferred or could support a directive     that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve     positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of     reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in     the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability     and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to     economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided     that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and     slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the     intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this     meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and     M3 over coming months.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank     of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by     the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in     accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests       that the expansion of economic activity has moderated       considerably in early 1995. Nonfarm payroll employment       rose appreciably further in January and February, but       at a pace below the average monthly gain in 1994; the       civilian unemployment rate, after rising in January,       fell back in February to its December level of 5.4       percent. Advances in industrial production also       moderated in January and February, and capacity       utilization rates generally changed little from already       high levels. Total retail sales were about unchanged       over the two months. Housing starts have declined       somewhat after posting sizable gains on balance during       the closing months of 1994. Orders for nondefense       capital goods point to a still strong expansion of       spending on business equipment, but with tentative       signs of some deceleration; nonresidential construction       has been trending appreciably higher. The nominal       deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened       sharply in January from its average rate in the fourth       quarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices       increased faster on average over January and February.On February 1, 1995, the Board of Governors       approved an increase from 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent in the       discount rate, and in keeping with the Committee\\'s       decision at the January 31-February 1 meeting, the       increase was allowed to show through fully to interest       rates in reserve markets. Nonetheless, most market       interest rates have declined somewhat since the       Committee meeting; the largest declines have been       concentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted       value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10       currencies was down substantially further over the       intermeeting period. The Mexican peso has continued to       depreciate against the dollar.M2 and M3 weakened in February, though data for       the first part of March pointed to some rebound.       Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt has picked       up a little in recent months.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary       and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In       furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its       meeting on January 31-February 1 established ranges for       growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4       percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter       of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee       anticipated that money growth within these ranges would       be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The       monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 3 to 7 percent for the       year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will       continue to be evaluated in the light of progress       toward price level stability, movements in their       velocities, and developments in the economy and       financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate       future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing       degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the       context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for       price stability and sustainable economic growth, and       giving careful consideration to economic, financial,       and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve       restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint       might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The       contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be       consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over       coming months.Votes for this action: Messrs.

The      Committee also liberalized its rule relating to attendance at FOMC      meetings to allow First Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks      to attend meetings on a rotating basis. Other changes of a technical      or updating nature also were made to the Program. The Committee\\'s      brief discussion of this organizational matter was not recorded in      keeping with the decision made at the meeting on January 31 February      1, 1995 normally not to record discussions unrelated to      monetary policy. By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal     Open Market Committee held on March 28, 1995, were approved.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on     developments in foreign exchange markets and on System foreign     currency transactions during the period March 28, 1995 through May 22,     1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Manager also reported on developments in domestic     financial markets and on System open market transactions in government     securities and federal agency obligations during the period March 28,     1995, through May 22, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified     these transactions.The Manager requested a temporary increase of $2 billion, to     $10 billion, in the limit on intermeeting changes in outright System     Account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities. He     advised the Committee that the current leeway of $8 billion might not     be sufficient to accommodate the potentially large need for additional     reserves over the intermeeting period to meet an anticipated seasonal     rise in the domestic demand for currency as well as continued currency     outflows to foreign countries. By unanimous vote, the Committee     amended paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market     Operations to raise the limit to $10 billion for the intermeeting     period ending with the close of business on July 5, 1995.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and     financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the     intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial     information available at the time of the meeting and of the     Committee\\'s discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic     policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the     Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the     expansion of economic activity had slowed considerably further and     that rates of resource utilization had declined. Although business     investment in equipment and structures had remained strong, overall     final sales had expanded less rapidly and inventories had continued to     build. Manufacturing output appeared to be down appreciably, in large     measure reflecting cutbacks in motor vehicle production, and the slump     in housing starts since the turn of the year was depressing     construction activity. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices     had increased a little faster thus far this year, while advances in     labor compensation costs had remained subdued.Nonfarm payroll employment posted reduced gains in the first     quarter and changed little in April; special factors and seasonal     adjustment difficulties may have depressed reported job growth in     April. Hiring in service-producing industries was down sharply from     the pace in previous months, with jobs in personnel supply services     falling for a second consecutive month after three years of rapid     growth. Employment in manufacturing decreased further, and the number     of construction jobs contracted after a sizable weather-related surge     in March. Initial claims for unemployment insurance increased     considerably in recent weeks, and the civilian unemployment rate rose     to 5.8 percent in April.Industrial production fell further in April, with     manufacturing registering a substantial decline. The drop in     industrial output largely reflected a cutback in the production of     motor vehicles and parts, but declines in output also were evident in     other cyclically sensitive sectors, such as non-auto consumer durables     and construction supplies. Production of business equipment other     than motor vehicles registered a small gain. Total utilization of     industrial capacity continued to decline in April; however, operating     rates in manufacturing remained at relatively high levels.Retail sales were down in April after having risen moderately     over the first quarter; a steep drop in sales of motor vehicles     accounted for all of the April decline. Total expenditures on other     types of goods edged higher in April, even though sales of apparel,     furniture, and home appliances were noticeably weaker. Housing starts     changed little in April after having declined sharply in the first     quarter, and the inventory of new homes for sale remained relatively     large. On the other hand, sales of both new and existing homes rose     moderately in March after sizable declines in February, and recent     surveys indicated some improvement in attitudes toward homebuying.Shipments of nondefense capital goods remained on a strong     uptrend in March, with outlays for office and computing equipment     registering another sharp increase. Manufacturers of heavy trucks     continued to operate at capacity to meet demand; by contrast, business     expenditures for motor vehicles reportedly plunged in April. Data on     orders for nondefense capital goods pointed to further strong     expansion of spending on business equipment in the months ahead,     although gains appeared likely to be smaller than those of the past     several quarters. Nonresidential construction continued to rise in     March, and data on permits for new construction suggested that     building activity would advance further in coming months, though     perhaps at a somewhat slower rate.Business inventories surged again in March, and the pace of     inventory accumulation over the first quarter was substantially higher     than the average rate for the second half of 1994. Much of the first-quarter increase in stocks reflected a buildup in inventories of motor     vehicles at the wholesale and retail levels. Non-auto stocks also     increased at a brisk pace in the first quarter, accompanied by the     emergence of scattered signs of inventory imbalances in furniture,     appliances, and apparel at the retail level and in construction     supplies at earlier stages of production and distribution. The stock-to-sales ratio in manufacturing was unchanged in March from the very     low fourth-quarter level. At the wholesale level, the ratio of     inventories to sales rose in March but remained within the range of     the last several years. Inventory accumulation in the retail sector     slowed in March despite a further rise in inventories of motor     vehicles. For the retail sector as a whole, the inventory-to-sales     ratio increased in March to the top end of its range of the last two     years; when the motor vehicle components of stocks and sales are     excluded, however, the ratio was near the middle of its range in     recent years.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was     little changed in March from the February level and remained     substantially narrower than in January. On a quarterly average basis,     the trade deficit widened in the first quarter as growth in the value     of exports slowed while the expansion in the value of imports     continued unabated. A drop in shipments to Mexico was among the     factors holding down export growth in March. Data available for the     first quarter indicated that economic recovery continued in the major     foreign industrial countries as a group but that the pace varied     significantly across countries. There were signs of sustained growth     in the United Kingdom, slower growth in Canada, renewed recovery in     Japan, and weakness in France and Italy.Inflation had picked up somewhat in the early months of 1995.     At the consumer level, prices rose a little more rapidly in the first     quarter, despite unchanged food prices and lower energy prices. In     April, a surge in food prices and a rebound in energy prices     contributed to a further step-up in consumer inflation. At the     producer level, prices of finished goods followed a roughly similar     pattern, increasing at a slightly faster pace in the first quarter and     then more briskly in April. The April rise partly reflected a sharp     jump in the prices of finished energy goods, but prices of non-energy,     nonfood items also advanced at a somewhat faster rate. At earlier     stages of production, prices of intermediate materials continued to     increase rapidly in April. By contrast, trends in labor compensation     costs remained subdued. Gains in hourly compensation of private     industry workers slowed further in the first quarter of 1995, with a     continuing moderation in the cost of benefits accounting for all of     the deceleration in compensation.At its meeting on March 28, 1995, the Committee adopted a     directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure     on reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible     firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period.     Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the     Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable     economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,     financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve     restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint     might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve     conditions associated with this directive were expected to be     consistent with moderate growth in the broader monetary aggregates     over coming months.Open market operations during the intermeeting period were     directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve     positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing trended higher over the     period, reflecting a rising need for seasonal credit at the beginning     of the planting season, while the federal funds rate continued to     average close to 6 percent.Most market interest rates moved lower over the intermeeting     period in reaction to weaker-than-expected incoming economic data,     which market participants interpreted as signaling a considerable     slowing of the economic expansion and a growing likelihood that the     next monetary policy move would be in an easing direction. Market     assessments that the prospects for major reductions in budget deficits     were improving also seemed to contribute to the drop in rates. In     this environment, the release of data indicating large increases in     consumer and producer prices for April only temporarily interrupted     the decline in rates. Intermediate- and long-term interest rates     posted the largest declines over the intermeeting period.In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the     dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined substantially     further over the first half of the intermeeting period. In mid-April,     the dollar reached a record low against the Japanese yen and     approached a record low against the German mark. The dollar\\'s     weakness appeared to have been related in part to further indications     of softening economic activity and related declines in interest rates     in the United States and to increasing trade tensions with Japan.     Late in the period, the dollar reversed its course and moved up     sharply against the yen and the mark; monetary easing abroad,     improving prospects for reductions in the U.S. budget deficit, and     stabilizing financial conditions in Mexico appeared to contribute to     the turnaround. The dollar ended the intermeeting period higher on     balance against the other G-10 currencies.The growth of M2 picked up further in April, reflecting in     part the need for additional liquid balances to make unusually heavy     final tax payments; these payments resulted from the stronger economy     in 1994 and from new tax regulations allowing individuals to delay a     larger portion of their tax payments until April. The expansion of M2     also appeared to be boosted by the increased relative attractiveness     of small time deposits and money market funds following declines in     market interest rates. For the year through April, M2 grew at a rate     in the lower half of its range for 1995 while M3 expanded at a rate     somewhat above its range. The persisting strength of M3 in April     largely reflected the needs of commercial banks to fund continuing     heavy credit demands by households and businesses. Total domestic     nonfinancial debt had grown at a rate a little above the midpoint of     its monitoring range in recent months.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that     growth of economic activity was slowing somewhat more than previously     anticipated, with the recent plunge in motor vehicle sales prompting a     deeper-than-expected reduction in the production of cars and light     trucks. Economic expansion would average less than the rate of     increase in the economy\\'s potential output for a number of months, but     the favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally     that had occurred in stock and bond markets were expected to provide     underlying support for aggregate demand later in the year and in 1996.     The forecast continued to anticipate that consumer spending would be     restrained by smaller gains in real incomes and the satisfaction of     pent-up demands for motor vehicles and other durable goods. Business     outlays for new equipment were expected to decelerate substantially in     response to the slower growth of sales and profits. Homebuilding was     projected to pick up somewhat in lagged response to the recent decline     in mortgage rates. Developments in Mexico might depress U.S. exports     further, but mainly in the very near term given the size of the     adjustments already evident in the Mexican current account. With this     influence waning, sustained growth in the economies of other U.S.     trading partners was expected to boost export demand. Considerable     uncertainty continued to surround the fiscal outlook, but the forecast     maintained the greater degree of fiscal restraint that had been     assumed since early in the year. In the staff\\'s judgment, the     prospects for some easing of pressures on resources suggested that     price inflation would likely moderate from its recently higher level.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective     economic conditions, members reported on statistical and anecdotal     indications of further slowing in the expansion of economic activity     and some related easing of pressures on labor and other producer     resources. A number commented that they anticipated a relatively     sluggish economic performance over coming months as production was cut     back to bring inventories into better balance with sales. However,     underlying demand was likely to remain sufficiently robust, especially     in light of developments in financial markets, to avert a cumulative     decline in business activity and, indeed, to return economic growth to     a pace broadly in line with potential. Members cited in particular     the strength in business fixed investment and the potential for     improvement in housing activity and the trade balance as factors that     should help to sustain the expansion. Nonetheless, the longer-run     outlook remained subject to considerable uncertainty, especially given     the undecided course of fiscal policy and the ongoing inventory     correction; the ultimate extent of that correction and its effects on     overall economic performance were subject to a cyclical dynamic whose     outcome could not be predicted with confidence. A worsening in key     measures of inflation, including the consumer price index and the     producer price index for finished goods, was a disappointing--if not     unexpected--development. A number of members expressed concern that     the risks were still tilted in the direction of some further step-up     in inflation; however, others were more inclined to the view that     inflation was not likely to rise much further in a climate of moderate     growth in demand, intense competitive pressures in many markets, and     relatively subdued increases in labor costs.Members commented that a reduction in the rate of inventory     investment was likely to be the dominant influence on the near-term     performance of the economy. Some also saw a risk that a significantly     greater-than-expected softening in inventory accumulation might have     adverse, and possibly cumulative, effects of a longer-term nature on     production and incomes and thus on consumer and business spending.     With the exception of the motor vehicle industry, however, current     inventory levels generally were quite low in relation to sales and     potential inventory adjustments were likely to be limited in size.     Once further inventory adjustments were completed, the rate of     accumulation could be expected to remain well below the unsustainable     pace experienced over the past year and perhaps settle into a pattern     where changes in inventories became a relatively neutral factor in the     ongoing economic expansion.In their comments about broad factors underlying the economic     outlook, members reported that current business and consumer sentiment     remained generally favorable across the nation. Despite the softening     demand in some markets or industries, notably that for motor vehicles,     business contacts continued to express optimism about the outlook for     their firms, though some of their comments were tempered by greater     caution than had been observed earlier. A number of members referred     to the general financial climate as an important element in the     outlook for sustained economic expansion. They noted that the decline     in interest rates had favorable implications for demand in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. The rise in equity prices also was     contributing to reductions in the cost of capital to businesses, and     banks continued to ease terms and standards on loans. In addition,     the rise in stock and bond prices had increased the net worth of many     households, though some concern was expressed about the sustainability     of the stock market\\'s strong performance.With regard to developments in key sectors of the economy,     the slowdown in the growth of consumer spending was somewhat more     pronounced than anticipated earlier. Some rebound in consumer demand     seemed likely and already appeared to be occurring in the motor     vehicle industry in May. Underlying conditions for further growth in     consumer spending were viewed as relatively favorable; these     conditions included strengthened balance sheets stemming from     developments in financial markets, continued growth of incomes, and     aggressive extensions of consumer credit by a number of lenders. In     at least one view, however, consumer credit had been growing at a pace     that could not be sustained and the inevitable correction could     coincide with and exacerbate emerging weakness in consumer demand. On     balance, growth in personal consumption expenditures was seen as     likely to continue over coming quarters but at a reduced pace given     the apparent satisfaction of a large portion of earlier pent-up     demands for consumer durables and some expected moderation in the     growth of jobs and incomes.Business investment remained on a strong uptrend as numerous     firms continued to respond to the need to relieve pressures on     existing capacity and to increase operating efficiencies in the face     of vigorous competition. Rapid growth in profits and a ready     availability of financing also were cited as factors tending to     support business investment spending. The increase in such spending     was likely to moderate over the projection horizon, though to a still     brisk pace, as declining growth in demand and easing pressures on     capacity induced growing caution in business investment decisions.     Indeed, the growth in expenditures for producer durable equipment     already appeared to be moderating from an extremely rapid pace, though     nonresidential construction was reported to be posting solid gains in     several parts of the country.Members also expected some strengthening in residential     construction following the large declines in mortgage interest rates     that had occurred since late 1994. Housing construction had trended     lower since the start of the year, but several indicators pointed to a     revival. The latter included surveys showing improving homebuyer     attitudes and builder assessments of the outlook for new home sales,     and rising applications to purchase homes. Sizable inventories of     unsold new homes would probably continue to damp construction activity     for some months, but contacts in the real estate and mortgage finance     industries were more optimistic about the outlook for housing.The foreign trade sector likewise was expected to make an     appreciable contribution to the expansion of economic activity in     coming quarters. The robust uptrend in U.S. exports during 1994 had     been slowed to a considerable extent thus far this year by the sharp     adjustment in trade with Mexico, but in the view of several members     that adjustment might now be largely completed. In that event, gains     in exports could be expected to resume at a fairly brisk pace despite     indications of reduced economic growth in some key foreign countries.     This assessment was supported by anecdotal reports of rising foreign     demand for some U.S. products in the context of the generally improved     international competitive position of the United States.     Concurrently, growth in imports would tend to be held down by the     projected slowing in the expansion of domestic demand. On the     negative side, some members referred to the possibility that a longer     period might be needed to resolve the difficulties being experienced     by Mexico, and several expressed particular concern about the     potential for relatively severe disruptions to trade if current     negotiations with Japan were not successfully concluded.Fiscal policy was seen as a major uncertainty in the economic     outlook. Federal purchases of goods and services were expected to     continue trending lower and the growth of transfer payments was likely     to be trimmed, but the extent and timing of fiscal restraint could not     be determined while federal deficit reduction continued to be debated     in the Congress. In the view of at least some members, however, a     larger fiscal contraction than was commonly expected might well     materialize, perhaps starting later this year. The course of fiscal     legislation undoubtedly would continue to affect financial markets     and, in the opinion of some members, would need to be taken into     account in the formulation of monetary policy.Concerning inflation, several members commented that the rise     in consumer prices and some other broad measures of inflation in     recent months appeared to reflect cyclical developments relating to     the tightening of resource and product markets over the past year,     including the partial pass-through of sizable increases in prices at     earlier stages of production. In addition, higher import prices     might have been playing a role. A number of members expressed concern     that, with the economy already producing at or even slightly above its     sustainable potential, inflation pressures were likely to intensify if     the current pause in the expansion were to be followed by a period of     above-average growth. On the other hand, members who saw the odds as     pointing to a more moderate rebound after a period of relatively     sluggish economic performance were inclined to the view that an upward     trend in inflation was likely to be averted. In addition, the ongoing     competitive pressures in many markets, the restraint in compensation     increases, and the continuing efforts to cut production costs would     help to contain pressures on prices over time.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting     period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain the     current stance of policy. The higher interest rates of 1994 clearly     had damped demand, but since year-end intermediate- and long-term     market rates had declined, stock market prices had risen, bank lending     terms had continued to ease, and the dollar had fallen against the     currencies of many major industrial countries. On balance, it     appeared that the current configuration of financial market conditions     and degree of monetary restraint was likely to be consistent with     moderate expansion in nominal GDP and prices following a period of     some weakness in the economy as inventory imbalances were corrected.     The risks of a different outcome, in either direction, seemed to be     reasonably balanced. In the circumstances, because the dimensions of     the near-term deceleration and the potential strength of underlying     demand remained uncertain, the members concluded that it was desirable     to monitor developments carefully and wait for additional information     before deciding on the next policy move.With regard to the possible need to adjust policy during the     intermeeting period, all the members were in favor of shifting     to an unbiased instruction that did not incorporate any presumption     with regard to the direction of potential intermeeting changes. The     members agreed that no compelling case could be made at this point for     potential adjustments to policy in either direction during the period     ahead, and retaining a bias in the directive would give a misleading     indication of the Committee\\'s current intentions for the period. One     member expressed the view that the costs of being wrong currently     seemed higher in the direction of accommodating too much inflation,     though signs of a possible cumulative deterioration in economic     activity could not be ignored should they materialize. Another     member, who saw the longer-term risks to the economy as tilted to the     downside of current projections, indicated that while the recent     performance of the economy might argue for some easing of monetary     policy, a steady policy course without any bias in the intermeeting     instruction was appropriate for now in light of the generally     accomodative financial and banking markets.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all the     members supported a directive that called for maintaining the existing     degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a     presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy     during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the     Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable     economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,     financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that     somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be     acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions     contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with     moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of     New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by     the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in     accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests       that the expansion of economic activity has slowed       considerably further. In April, nonfarm payroll       employment was about unchanged after posting reduced       gains in the first quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent. Industrial production       fell in April, largely reflecting a cutback in the       production of motor vehicles, and capacity utilization       rates declined somewhat. Reflecting markedly weaker       demand for motor vehicles, total retail sales were down       in April after rising moderately over the first       quarter. Housing starts were unchanged in April after       declining sharply in the first quarter. Orders for       nondefense capital goods point to further strong       expansion of spending on business equipment; nonresidential construction has continued to trend       appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade       in goods and services widened in the first quarter from       its average rate in the fourth quarter. Broad indexes       of consumer and producer prices have increased faster       on average thus far this year, while advances in labor       compensation costs have remained subdued.Intermediate- and long-term interest rates have       declined considerably further since the Committee       meeting on March 28, while short-term rates have       registered small decreases. In foreign exchange       markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in       terms of the other G-10 currencies, after falling to       low levels, rose on balance over the intermeeting       period.M2 and M3 strengthened in March and April. For       the year through April, M2 expanded at a rate in the       lower half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate       somewhat above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial       debt has grown at a rate a bit above the midpoint of       its monitoring range in recent months.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary       and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In       furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its       meeting on January 31-February 1 established ranges for       growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4       percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter       of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee       anticipated that money growth within these ranges would       be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The       monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 3 to 7 percent for the       year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will       continue to be evaluated in the light of progress       toward price level stability, movements in their       velocities, and developments in the economy and       financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate       future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing       degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the       context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for       price stability and sustainable economic growth, and       giving careful consideration to economic, financial,       and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve       restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be       acceptable in the intermeeting period. The       contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be       consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over       coming months.Votes for this action: Messrs.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified     these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and     financial outlook, the ranges for growth of money and debt in 1995 and     1996, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting     period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information     available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion     is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was     approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of     New York.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the     level of economic activity was about unchanged in the second quarter.     Consumer spending apparently remained sluggish, and business spending     on plant and equipment rose less rapidly than in other recent     quarters. With final sales flagging, firms sought to hold down     production and employment in order to keep inventories under control.     Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had increased faster on     balance thus far this year, but signs of some moderation in inflation     were evident in recent price data. Growth of labor compensation costs     remained subdued.Nonfarm payroll employment fell substantially in May after a     small decline in April and reduced gains in the first quarter.     Payrolls in the services industry continued to rise in May, but the     pace of hiring was well below the average rate of increase over other     recent months. In manufacturing and construction, employment     contracted further in May, although part of the job decline in     construction might have been temporary, reflecting heavy rains and     floods in the South. The civilian unemployment rate edged lower in     May, to 5.7 percent, but was somewhat above its average for the first     quarter.Industrial production continued to weaken in May, and     incoming data suggested a further decline in June. Manufacturing     output fell in May for a fourth consecutive month, reflecting another     cutback in the production of motor vehicles. Output of non-auto     manufactured goods was unchanged, with increases in the production of     nondurable consumer goods and non-auto business equipment offsetting     declines in output elsewhere. Utilization of manufacturing capacity     dropped again in May but was still at a relatively high level.Nominal retail sales were about unchanged over April and May.     Purchases at furniture and appliance stores were up slightly on     balance over the two months. Sales at automotive dealerships and     apparel outlets fell in April but revived somewhat in May. Spending     at building materials stores fell in both months. The retail sales     reports, in combination with data on consumer prices and unit motor-vehicle sales, suggested that inflation-adjusted spending for consumer     goods had changed little since the fourth quarter of last year.     Housing starts were unchanged on balance over April and May; a     reduction in starts of single-family homes was offset by a rise in     starts of multifamily units. Adverse weather in some parts of the     country might have contributed to the sluggishness in starts. Home     sales were higher in May: Sales of new homes turned up sharply, and     sales of existing homes also advanced somewhat.Shipments of nondefense capital goods increased considerably     in May after being unchanged in April. Shipments of computing     equipment remained robust on balance over April and May, but growth of     shipments of other business equipment slowed significantly. Sales of     heavy trucks rebounded strongly in May from an April decline. Recent     data on new orders for nondefense capital goods suggested that     spending on business equipment might moderate somewhat in the months     ahead after an extended period of rapid expansion. Nonresidential     construction continued to trend appreciably higher in April;     particularly large gains were recorded in the public utility,     industrial, and institutional categories.Business inventories grew at a little slower rate in April     than in the first quarter. In manufacturing, inventory investment     remained brisk in April but slowed somewhat in May; the inventory-to-sales ratio for the two months was at the high end of the range for     the past year. At the wholesale level, the rate of increase in stocks     in April equaled the first-quarter pace and the ratio of stocks to     sales reached its highest level in several years. Inventory     accumulation in the retail sector was more moderate in April. More     than half the rise occurred at automotive establishments. The     inventory-to-sales ratio for retailers other than auto dealers had     remained stable for a number of months and was near the middle of its     range for recent years.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services     widened substantially in April from its average rate for the first     quarter. The value of imports was up sharply, with increases posted     in nearly all major import categories. The value of exports rose     modestly from the first-quarter level; increases in exports of     aircraft and industrial supplies were partially offset by declines in     exports of automotive products to Canada and Mexico. Available data     indicated that, on average, economic growth in the major foreign     industrial countries had been sluggish in the first quarter and     apparently had remained so in the second quarter; growth had been     particularly weak in Canada and Japan.Incoming data suggested that price inflation might be slowing     a little after having picked up early in the year. Consumer prices     rose a bit less in May; energy prices recorded another sizable     increase, but food prices changed little and prices of other items     advanced more slowly. However, for the twelve months ended in May,     prices of nonfood, non-energy consumer items increased slightly more     than in the preceding twelve months. At the producer level, prices of     finished goods were unchanged in May, reflecting declines in the     prices of finished foods and finished energy goods; excluding food and     energy, prices of finished goods rose in May at the same rate as in     April. For the year ending in May, producer prices rose moderately     after being essentially unchanged in the previous year. At earlier     stages of production, producer prices grew at a considerably slower     rate or declined in May, suggesting some easing of cost pressures over     the next few months. Average hourly compensation in the nonfarm     business sector accelerated in the first quarter of the year, owing in     large part to temporary developments. Over the year ended in March,     this compensation measure increased somewhat more than it had over the     previous year. Average hourly earnings declined in May, but the     change in hourly earnings over the past twelve months was slightly     larger than the advance over the preceding twelve-month period.At its meeting on May 23, 1995, the Committee adopted a     directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure     on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the     likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting     period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the     Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable     economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,     financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve     restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable     during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated     with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate     growth in the broader monetary aggregates over the months ahead.Open market operations during the intermeeting period were     directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve     positions. The federal funds rate generally remained near 6 percent,     but most short-term interest rates were down on balance in response to     incoming economic data, particularly the employment report for May,     that were seen by market participants as increasing the likelihood     that monetary policy would be eased in the near future. Longer-term     interest rates also declined in reaction to growing indications that     efforts to narrow substantially the U.S. budget deficit might be     successful. Yields on corporate and municipal obligations fell less     than Treasury rates and risk spreads widened a little, particularly     for junk bonds. Major indexes of equity prices rose over the     intermeeting period, partly in response to lower interest rates.In foreign exchange markets over the intermeeting period, the     trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10     currencies declined considerably on balance. The dollar fell sharply     in the week after the May meeting on further news of weakening in the     U.S. economy but rebounded somewhat at the end of the month when     concerted central-bank intervention was carried out. The dollar     remained relatively stable over the balance of the period.Growth of M2 strengthened substantially in May and June.     Downward adjustments in returns on deposits and retail money fund     shares had lagged declines in market interest rates in recent months,     and investors evidently responded by shifting funds from market     instruments into these M2 assets. For the year through June, M2     expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995. M3 also     accelerated in May and June; and for the year through June, this     aggregate grew at a rate well above the annual range set in February.     The pickup in M3 growth importantly reflected more rapid inflows to     institution-only money funds, whose yields also adjusted sluggishly to     falling money market rates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had     grown at a rate in the upper half of its monitoring range in recent     months.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that     economic activity would expand sluggishly over the next few months as     business firms adjusted production schedules to bring inventories into     better alignment with sales. Subsequently, as inventory positions     were corrected, and with underlying support for final sales from the     favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally in     the equity and debt markets, the economy would begin to expand at a     moderate pace. The forecast assumed a modest step-up in the pace of     consumer spending in response to some diminution of concerns about job     prospects and incomes as well as improved financial conditions and     household balance sheets. Homebuilding was projected to pick up     somewhat in lagged response to the recent decline in mortgage rates     and the related improvement in housing affordability. Business     outlays for new equipment were expected to slow from the very rapid     pace of the past few years in response to the slower growth of sales     and profits, but lower costs of capital and the ready availability of     financing would help to sustain appreciable growth in such investment.     Export expansion would pick up in response to some anticipated     strengthening in the economies of major U.S. trading partners.     Considerable uncertainty continued to surround the fiscal outlook, but     in light of recent developments the forecast now reflected a greater     degree of fiscal restraint. In the staff's judgment, the prospects     for some easing of pressure on labor and other resources suggested     that price inflation likely would moderate from its recently higher     level.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective     economic developments, members commented that the apparent pause in     the expansion was likely to prove temporary, and their forecasts     generally pointed to an upturn in overall economic activity to a pace     in the neighborhood of the economy's potential by the latter part of     this year or early 1996. Many emphasized that the prospects for a     strengthening economy were enhanced by the drop in intermediate- and     long-term interest rates and the rise in equity prices. In the view     of most members, however, the risks to the outlook were tilted to the     downside. Several stressed that the ongoing adjustments to business     inventories could prove to be more pronounced and of longer duration     than they anticipated, with negative repercussions on production and     incomes and in turn on consumer spending and business investment.     Other downside risks included the adverse implications for exports of     potentially less-than-projected expansion in a number of major foreign     economies. Nonetheless, recent developments suggested that the period     of maximum risk to the domestic expansion might have passed. With     pressures on resources having diminished and likely to ease somewhat     further and with labor costs remaining subdued, the risk of continuing     increases in inflation had fallen considerably; indeed, in the view of     many members inflation should moderate over the projection period.In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee     sets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the     members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not     currently serving as members provided their individual projections of     the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the     rate of inflation for the years 1995 and 1996. The forecasts of the     rate of expansion in real GDP for 1995 as a whole had a central     tendency of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, reflecting expectations of a pickup in     growth to a moderate pace in the second half of the year; for 1996,     projections of growth in real GDP centered on a range of 2-1/4 to     2-3/4 percent. With regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the     growth forecasts were concentrated in a range of 4-1/4 to 4-3/4     percent for 1995 and 4-3/4 to 5-3/8 percent for 1996. The rate of     unemployment associated with these forecasts was expected to edge     higher in the second half of this year to a consensus range of 5-3/4     to 6-1/8 percent in the fourth quarters of both 1995 and 1996.     Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer     price index, pointed to a small decline over the projection horizon;     the projections converged on rates of 3-1/8 to 3-3/8 percent for 1995     and 2-7/8 to 3-1/4 percent for 1996.In the course of the discussion, members indicated that much     of the economic information that had become available since the May     meeting had suggested a greater softening in the economy than they had     anticipated and had raised concerns about the timing and strength of     the upturn over coming quarters. However, the most recent data and     some of the anecdotal reports from around the country had a better     tone. Among the positive factors in the economic outlook, members     gave particular emphasis to the favorable financial climate, including     the stimulative effects of lower interest rates on interest-sensitive     sectors of the economy, the ready availability of financing from     market sources and banking institutions, and the impact of rising     equity and bond prices on balance sheets. Business and consumer     sentiment also remained generally favorable, though anecdotal reports     suggested a heightened degree of caution among business contacts in     many parts of the nation. Members observed that the expansion did not     appear to have produced overall imbalances in the economy aside from     an apparent overhang of inventories in some industries. The ongoing     adjustments needed to bring these inventories down to desired levels     were seen as the most serious threat to the expansion. Some members     commented that the inventory correction in the second quarter appeared     on the basis of the available evidence to be less than was expected     earlier and that the period of inventory adjustment might therefore be     more extended in time than they had anticipated. While such a     development might not in itself be sufficient to tilt the economy into     recession, in the possible context of relatively sluggish growth in     final demands, the economy would be vulnerable to adverse domestic or     external shocks. On balance, while the timing remained uncertain, a     resumption of growth at a moderate rate was viewed as a likely     prospect, given the underlying strength of the economy.In their review of prospective developments in key sectors of     the economy, members noted that consumer expenditures had fallen short     of earlier expectations, but signs of some firming were visible,     notably the indications of an improvement in sales of motor vehicles     since early spring. While a continued sluggish performance of the     consumer sector could not be ruled out, the members generally expected     a resumption of moderate growth in consumer spending. The upturn     undoubtedly would be limited to some extent by the apparent exhaustion     of much of the earlier pent-up demands and perhaps by concerns about     job prospects and incomes, but the effects of reduced interest rates     on borrowers and the wealth effects from gains in values of financial     assets should help to sustain moderate growth. Moreover, if the     strengthening in housing activity materialized as projected, sales of     consumer durables would be favorably affected. While consumer     confidence had declined earlier, recent surveys indicated that     confidence had stabilized or even edged up more recently and was in     any event at relatively high levels in most parts of the country.Business fixed investment appeared to have moderated since     earlier in the year, though expenditures for both producer durable     equipment and nonresidential structures were still registering strong     gains. Further moderation was anticipated over the course of coming     quarters in association with slower growth in business sales and     decreased pressures on producer resources. While some concern was     expressed about the vulnerability of capital spending to a downturn in     the growth of sales, the members generally expected this sector of the     economy to remain a positive factor in the expansion. The ready     availability of financing on favorable terms and the ongoing need to     modernize equipment and other producer resources for competitive     reasons, notably to take advantage of continuing improvements in     computer and other technologies, should foster continued overall     growth in business investment. Members also noted that the strength     in business profits, though likely to moderate cyclically at some     point, remained a favorable factor undergirding business capital     spending.Housing activity had stagnated in recent months, but this     sector of the economy also was expected to provide some stimulus to     the expansion as home buyers responded to reduced mortgage rates.     Although the latest available data indicated that housing starts were     still relatively depressed, home sales and mortgage loan applications     for home purchases had strengthened recently. With some exceptions,     building industry contacts in local areas tended to confirm broader     indications that improvement in housing activity was occurring.     Members also noted that rising occupancy levels and rents should     support fairly robust construction of multifamily housing in many     areas.With regard to the outlook for fiscal policy, members gave     considerable emphasis to recent developments in Congress which     suggested that there could be greater deficit reduction over the years     ahead than had been built into many forecasts. The direct effects of     deficit cutbacks would tend to hold down the growth in final demand     and act as a restraining influence on overall economic activity over     the projection horizon. But those cutbacks also would have favorable     effects on financial markets, thereby stimulating to an extent     offsetting increases in spending. Over the longer run, deficit     reduction should enhance the performance and growth of the economy,     though monetary policy makers would need to carefully monitor possible     transition effects.A considerable downside risk in the view of many members was     the outlook for exports. Economic activity in the major foreign     industrial nations had been more sluggish than anticipated during the     first half of the year, and this raised questions about the strength     of the expansion in those countries and the related prospects for the     faster growth in U.S. exports. Most of the major economies in Latin     America also were projected to strengthen, and indeed such     expectations were reflected in financial markets, but substantial     problems remained that could undermine the favorable outlook. On the     positive side, members observed that U.S. exports were now quite     competitive in world markets, as evidenced by continuing gains in     exports to numerous countries, and such a perception was reinforced by     anecdotal reports of increasing foreign sales of a variety of products     by firms around the country. On balance, some growth in exports     remained a reasonable prospect but it might fall below current     expectations.The members generally agreed that the inflation risks in the     economy had diminished, though some still saw the potential for     little or no progress in unwinding the recent uptick in inflation.     Many referred to indications of easing pressures on resources in     recent months, and they generally felt that such pressures would be     contained over the projection horizon if economic growth were to     materialize in line with their forecasts. Developments seen as     consistent with such an expectation included persisting anecdotal     reports of highly competitive markets that made it very difficult for     business firms to pass on cost increases or to raise profit margins.     Moreover, despite continuing reports of labor scarcities in some areas     and industries, increases in nominal labor costs generally had     remained subdued across the nation. Prices of many raw materials and     semi-finished goods had increased sharply in earlier months and these     increases would continue to put upward pressure on the prices of     finished goods, but there recently had been signs of some abatement of     inflation at the earlier stages of production. Similarly, earlier     declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were placing     upward pressure on the prices of many imported products, but the     recent stability of the dollar promised a diminution of such pressure     over time. On balance, most of the members believed that the     underlying trend of inflation was now tilted toward gradual     deceleration in the context of marginally higher rates of unemployed     labor and other resources, but they acknowledged that the risks to     such an outcome remained substantial.In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and     Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee     at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth in the monetary and     debt aggregates that it had established in February for 1995 and it     decided on tentative ranges for growth in those aggregates in 1996.     The current ranges set in February for the period from the fourth     quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995 included expansion of 1     to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. A monitoring range for     growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set at 3 to 7     percent for 1995.In the Committee's discussion, the members took account of     the accelerated rates of M2 and M3 growth since early spring that, for     the year to date, had lifted the expansion of M2 to the upper half of     the Committee's range and the expansion of M3 further above its     range. According to a staff projection, the growth of both aggregates     was likely to moderate over the balance of the year, assuming an     unchanged monetary policy, as rates paid on various components of the     aggregates were adjusted more fully to the reductions in market     interest rates that had occurred since early in the year. Even so,     the projected growth of the broad aggregates would remain well above     that experienced over the last several years. These developments     implied velocity behavior for these aggregates that was more in line     with historical patterns after several years of pronounced and     atypical velocity increases. The members noted that financial     innovations, technical changes, and deregulation had obscured     historical distinctions among various financial instruments and had     affected the extent to which holders might shift funds into or out of     components of the monetary aggregates in response to changing interest     rate patterns. As a result, substantial uncertainty remained about     projections of money growth and the future relationships of money and     debt to the basic objectives of monetary policy. Against this     background, members expressed somewhat differing views regarding     appropriate ranges for the growth of M2 and M3 in 1995 and 1996.With regard to M2, a majority of the members favored or could     accept a proposal to maintain the existing 1 to 5 percent range for     both years. These members noted that M2 growth was projected to     remain within the current range, though in the upper half in 1995 and     at the top in 1996. While recognizing that expansion at a rate above     that range could not be ruled out, especially for 1996, they suggested     that an increase in the range, at a time when substantial     uncertainties continued to surround the relationship of M2 to broad     measures of economic performance, would imply a degree of confidence     regarding the relationship that the Committee did not possess at this     point. Moreover, if the more normal behavior of velocity over the     past several quarters were to continue, a 1 to 5 percent range for     growth of M2 likely would prove consistent with the Committee's     ultimate objectives of sustained economic expansion and reasonable     price stability. There was concern that an increase in the M2 range     could foster a misreading of the Committee's intentions, especially if     some easing in policy were to be approved during this meeting,     explanations of the technical reasons notwithstanding.Members preferring a somewhat higher M2 range emphasized     that expectations for growth of this aggregate in 1995 and 1996 were     around the upper end of the current range. In their view, under the     Federal Reserve Act, the Committee's target ranges--and normally their     midpoints--should be consistent with the Committee's expectations for     growth in nominal GDP and money. From this perspective, a higher M2     range was clearly defensible and the reasons for it easily     communicated. Indeed, a failure to adjust the range upward could be     interpreted by observers as indicating an intent to tighten policy     should M2 growth remain high in relation to its current range.With regard to M3, all the members indicated that they     preferred or could accept an increase in its range to 2 to 6 percent     for both years. The current 0 to 4 percent range was quite low in     relation to the range for M2, judging by the average historical growth     of this aggregate relative to that of M2. The range had been adopted     in the light of unusual developments that had depressed M3 growth over     much of the 1990s. Those developments, which also had served to curb     M2 growth though to a lesser extent, involved a reduced role of     banking institutions in the intermediation of flows of funds between     savers and borrowers. That reduced role had been induced to a large     degree by balance sheet adjustments undertaken in response to     extraordinary strains experienced by banks and thrifts. Against the     background of favorable economic developments, the financial health of     depository institutions had improved markedly over the last few years,     and the increased ability and willingness of these institutions to     serve as financial intermediaries appeared to be working toward     strengthening the growth of M3 and lowering its velocity. In the     circumstances, the members believed that the contemplated increase in     the M3 range was essentially a technical response to developments that     were tending to restore both traditional financing patterns and the     historical pattern of somewhat faster growth in M3 than in M2. In     this respect, the increase in the M3 range did not have any     implications for the underlying thrust of monetary policy, though the     higher range could prove to be more consistent over time with     sustainable and noninflationary economic growth. As in the case of     the current M2 range, that conclusion assumed the eventual restoration     of historic relationships between M3 and measures of overall economic     performance.The Committee was unanimous in its view that the current     monitoring range for the growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt     should be retained for 1995 and extended to 1996. This view took into     account staff projections indicating that the debt aggregate was     likely to grow at rates well within its 3 to 7 percent range--indeed,     not far from the midpoint--in both years.At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to     reaffirm the range of 1 to 5 percent for growth of M2 in 1995 and to     set the same range on a tentative basis for 1996:Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,       McDonough, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey, Melzer,       Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, and Ms. Phillips.Votes against this action: Mr. Blinder       and Ms. Yellen.Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen dissented on a technical judgment,     not a policy difference. They noted that if growth in the demand for     M2 were close to historic norms in 1995 or 1996, as indeed it had been     for some time, then the Committee members' projections for nominal GDP     would likely imply M2 growth near the top of, or even above, the     current range. While the relationship between the growth of M2 and     that of nominal GDP remained subject to a great deal of uncertainty,     they were persuaded that the range--in fact, the midpoint of the     range--should normally be consistent with members' forecasts of     nominal GDP growth. This would be truer to the spirit of the     aggregates targeting provision in the Federal Reserve Act. From this     perspective, they viewed a higher M2 range for 1995 and 1996 as     clearly preferable in communicating the Committee's objectives for the     economy and its expectations for money growth.The Committee then voted to raise the range for growth of M3     to 2 to 6 percent for 1995 and to extend that higher range     provisionally to 1996:Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,       McDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey,       Melzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, and Mses. Phillips       and Yellen.Votes against this action: None.The Committee voted to retain the 3 to 7 percent monitoring     range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt for 1995 and to     extend that range on a tentative basis to 1996:Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,       McDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey,       Melzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, and Mses. Phillips       and Yellen.Votes against this action: None.These votes constituted approval of the following paragraph     for the directive that would be issued at the end of the meeting:The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary       and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In       furtherance of these objectives, the Committee       reaffirmed at this meeting the range it had established       on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5       percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to       the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also       retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the       year that it had set for growth of total domestic       nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range       for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to       take account of changing intermediation patterns. For       1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis       the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary       aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter       of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of       the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated       in the light of progress toward price level stability,       movements in their velocities, and developments in the       economy and financial markets.In the course of the Committee's discussion of its monetary     growth ranges, members commented on the failure of the monetary     aggregates to provide a reliable nominal anchor for the conduct of     monetary policy in recent years. Moreover, the restoration of     historic relationships, or the emergence of new but stable     relationships, between money growth and measures of progress toward     broad economic objectives could not be predicted with any degree of     confidence. Some members expressed the view that in these     circumstances the Committee needed to continue to look at potential     alternative approaches to guide the formulation of policy and to     communicate its intentions to the public, especially with respect to     the Committee's objective of promoting price stability over time.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting     period ahead, nearly all the members indicated that they favored or     could support a proposal to ease slightly the current degree of     pressure on reserve positions. Preferences for an unchanged policy     stance and for somewhat greater easing also were expressed. In     support of at least slight easing, members commented that they viewed     current monetary policy as somewhat restrictive, judged in part by the     level of the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate. This degree of     monetary restraint had been appropriate early in the year when the     economy was operating at or possibly beyond its long-run potential and     inflation pressures appeared to be mounting. Some modest easing was     desirable now that the growth of the economy had slowed considerably     more than anticipated and potential inflationary pressures seemed to     be in the process of receding. Although inflation was higher than in     1994 and the economy was still operating at an elevated level, looking     forward many members saw prospects for declining inflation and the     possibility of shortfalls in economic growth. The members agreed that     under present economic conditions a slight easing of the stance of     policy would incur little risk of stimulating increased inflation and     would be entirely consistent with their commitment to continued     progress toward price stability over time. Several members also     observed that any move toward less restraint should be cautious at     this point because easing would represent a change in the direction of     policy and its repercussions on financial markets, including the     foreign exchange markets, could be relatively pronounced.A few members preferred somewhat greater easing. They     stressed that such a move was warranted by the recent pause in the     expansion and the apparent vulnerability of the economy to a variety     of downside risks. Indeed, a move from what they saw as a restrictive     monetary policy toward a more neutral policy stance was somewhat     overdue in their view. While they could support a slight adjustment     to policy at this point, these members were persuaded that the stance     of monetary policy probably would need to be eased by more than a     slight amount over time to accommodate the intermediate- and long-term     needs of an expanding economy. Moreover, the risks of increasing     inflationary pressures appeared to be relatively remote in the context     of the current and anticipated performance of the overall economy.     The declines in intermediate- and long-term interest rates were     helping to support the expansion, but those declines rested in part on     market expectations of significant monetary policy easing; failure to     ratify such expectations could well result in at least a partial     reversal of those desirably lower rates.Members who leaned toward an unchanged policy remained     concerned about the persistence of inflationary pressures and whether     a somewhat easier policy stance would be consistent with the objective     of capping inflation and setting the stage for further progress toward     price stability. The available evidence on the economy's current     performance remained mixed and most forecasts pointed to moderate     strengthening ahead; in the circumstances an easing move did not     appear to be needed at this time. One member emphasized that,     while the risks of greater inflation seemed small, the costs of a     policy error in the direction of too much easing would be high in     terms of its effects on the credibility of the System's anti-inflationary policy and the need to rein in inflationary growth next     year. Although their preference would be to wait for further evidence     on the performance of the economy, all but one of these members     indicated that, given the current uncertainties surrounding the     economic outlook and the small amount of easing that was proposed,     they would not dissent from the majority position.With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the     intermeeting period, most of the members who favored some easing also     preferred an asymmetric directive, including a marked preference on     the part of those who supported greater easing than the majority. An     asymmetric directive was consistent with the view shared by most     members that the risks to the expansion were biased to the downside,     but no member expressed a strong presumption about the likely need to     ease policy during the weeks ahead. The Committee would, of course,     monitor and respond as needed to the incoming economic information.At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one     of the members indicated that they favored or could support a     directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure     on reserve positions and that included a bias toward possible further     easing of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period.     Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for     price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful     consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the     Committee decided that somewhat greater monetary restraint might be     acceptable or somewhat lesser monetary restraint would be acceptable     during the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the     reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent     with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of     New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by     the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in     accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests       that the level of economic activity was about unchanged       in the second quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment fell       in April and May after posting reduced gains in the       first quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate, at       5.7 percent in May, was up somewhat from its first-quarter average. Industrial production continued to       decline in May, reflecting another cutback in the       production of motor vehicles, and capacity utilization       was down somewhat further. Total retail sales have       been sluggish on average in recent months. Housing       starts were about unchanged over April and May, but       sales of new homes turned up sharply in May. Orders       for nondefense capital goods have moderated somewhat in       recent months but still point to considerable further       expansion of spending on business equipment; nonresidential construction has continued to trend       appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade       in goods and services widened in April from its average       rate in the first quarter. Broad indexes of consumer       and producer prices have increased faster on average       thus far this year, though there were signs of some       moderation in the most recent data; advances in labor       compensation costs have remained subdued.Most interest rates have declined somewhat further       since the Committee meeting on May 23. In foreign       exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the       dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined       considerably over the intermeeting period.M2 and M3 strengthened substantially in May and       June. For the year through June, M2 expanded at a rate       in the upper half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at       a rate well above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at a rate in the upper half of       its monitoring range in recent months.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary       and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In       furtherance of these objectives, the Committee       reaffirmed at this meeting the range it had established       on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5       percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to       the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also       retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the       year that it had set for growth of total domestic       nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range       for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to       take account of changing intermediation patterns. For       1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis       the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary       aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter       of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of       the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated       in the light of progress toward price level stability,       movements in their velocities, and developments in the       economy and financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate       future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the       existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In       the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for       price stability and sustainable economic growth, and       giving careful consideration to economic, financial,       and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve       restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint       would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The       contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be       consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over       coming months.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,       McDonough, Blinder, Kelley, Lindsey, Melzer,       Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips and       Yellen.Vote against this action: Mr. Hoenig.Mr. Hoenig dissented because he believed the stance of     monetary policy should remain unchanged at this time. With the pace     of economic activity likely to return to trend growth later this year     and inflation expected to be higher this year and next than in 1994,     he felt an unchanged policy in the near term would enhance the     prospects of achieving the Committee's long-run objectives of     sustainable economic growth and price stability.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would     be held on Tuesday, August 22, 1995.The meeting adjourned at 12:20 p.m.Donald L.

Attended portion of meeting relating to the Committee's economic   discussion.By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal     Open Market Committee held on July 5-6, 1995, were approved.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on     developments in foreign exchange markets and on System foreign     currency transactions during the period July 6, 1995, through August     21, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these     transactions.The Manager also reported on developments in domestic     financial markets and on System open market transactions in government     securities and federal agency obligations during the period July 6,     1995, through August 21, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee     ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and     financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the     intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial     information available at the time of the meeting and of the     Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic     policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the     Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that     economic activity was expanding more rapidly after increasing at a     sluggish pace in the second quarter. Consumer spending appeared to be     growing at a moderate rate, housing demand seemed to be rebounding     sharply, and business investment remained on a solid uptrend. With     efforts to adjust inventories still under way, industrial production     had changed little in recent months, and employment gains had been     modest. After increasing at elevated rates in the early part of the     year, consumer and producer prices had risen more slowly in recent     months. Advances in labor compensation costs remained subdued.Nonfarm payroll employment rose further in July after a     modest second-quarter gain; the July advance was held down by     continuing employment losses in manufacturing that were widespread by     industry. Outside of manufacturing, payrolls continued to increase at     a relatively slow pace in July; reduced job growth in the services     industry reflected smaller increases in employment at business and     health service establishments. The civilian unemployment rate rose     slightly in July, returning to its second-quarter average of 5.7     percent.Industrial production edged higher in July, but it was     unchanged on balance over the three months ending in July after     declining in earlier months. Manufacturing output fell further in     July; a sharp contraction in the production of motor vehicles and     parts accounted for the entire decline. Within manufacturing, output     of business equipment other than motor vehicles continued to advance     as additional strong gains were recorded in the production of office     and computing equipment. The output of non-auto consumer goods     weakened; a cutback in the production of home furnishings offset an     increase in the manufacture of appliances. With capacity continuing     to expand rapidly, total utilization of industrial capacity dropped     somewhat further.Despite edging down in July, revised data for earlier months     suggested that total retail sales had risen appreciably on balance     since early spring. The July decline entirely reflected weakness in     motor vehicles; elsewhere, spending on furniture and appliances     continued to firm, and purchases of other durable goods and of apparel     rose sharply. Housing market activity picked up considerably in June,     with sales of both new and existing homes increasing significantly.     Housing starts were up strongly in July after changing little in     previous months.Shipments of nondefense capital goods, led by surging     purchases of computing equipment, continued to grow rapidly in the     second quarter. However, business spending for transportation     equipment, notably heavy trucks and aircraft, was lackluster. New     orders for nondefense capital goods edged lower in the second quarter     after rising sharply early this year, although the elevated level of     order backlogs pointed to considerable further expansion of spending     on business equipment over coming months. Nonresidential construction     activity posted a solid gain in the second quarter, and recent data on     permits suggested further increases in building activity in coming     months.Business inventory accumulation slowed markedly further in     June, and inventory-to-sales ratios for most types of business     establishments declined again. In manufacturing, the aggregate     inventory-to-sales ratio was only a little above the historical low     reached around the end of 1994. In the wholesale sector, the ratio of     stocks to sales in June was slightly below the top of the range     prevailing over the last year. At the retail level, inventories     changed little in June, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this     sector was near the middle of its range for recent years.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services     widened in June, with exports declining marginally more than imports.     For the second quarter as a whole, the deficit was substantially     larger than in the first quarter. Exports were up considerably in the     second quarter despite declines in automotive products shipped to     Canada and Mexico, but imports rose by even more, with increases     widely spread across most major trade categories. In the major     foreign industrial countries, economic growth appeared to have ranged     from weak to moderate in the second quarter, and the limited available     evidence suggested that subdued expansion continued into the third     quarter. Economic activity remained particularly weak in Japan. In     Europe, expansion apparently was still under way, though somewhat     unevenly across countries.Consumer prices rose more slowly in June and July, with food     and energy price movements having little effect on the overall index;     price increases for nonfood, non-energy items were somewhat smaller     than those seen earlier in the year. Over the twelve-month period     ended in July, however, this measure of consumer inflation rose at     about the same rate as in the preceding twelve months. Producer     prices of finished goods edged lower on balance in June and July,     reflecting substantial declines in prices of finished energy goods.     Excluding food and energy, producer prices rose by more over the year     ended in July than over the preceding year. At earlier stages of     production, increases in producer prices had diminished sharply in     recent months, perhaps suggesting some abatement of pressures on     production capacity and prices. Total hourly compensation for private     industry workers increased somewhat more in the second quarter than in     the first; however, the rise in compensation costs for the year ended     in June was smaller than that for the previous year, primarily     reflecting slower growth in costs of benefits. Average hourly     earnings grew faster in July than in June; for the year ending in     July, earnings rose somewhat more than in the preceding year.At its meeting on July 5-6, 1995, the Committee adopted a     directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure     on reserve positions and that included a tilt toward possible further     easing of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. The     directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run     objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and     giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary     developments, slightly greater reserve restraint might or slightly     lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting     period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were     expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over     coming months.Immediately after the meeting, open market operations were     directed toward implementing the slight easing in the degree of     reserve pressure that had been adopted by the Committee. Thereafter,     operations were conducted with a view to maintaining this slightly     more accommodative reserve posture, and the federal funds rate     remained near 5-3/4 percent over the intermeeting interval.     Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat above anticipated     levels, largely reflecting heavy adjustment borrowing activity on the     August 2 reserve settlement day when demands for excess reserves were     unexpectedly large.Treasury yields declined across the maturity spectrum in     response to the announcement of the easing action on July 6; market     participants perceived the policy move as an indication of the Federal     Reserve's concern regarding the state of the economy and, based on     historical precedent, as likely the first in a series of easing steps.     Subsequently, however, interest rates rebounded in response to     incoming economic data that were seen as suggesting stronger economic     performance and reduced chances for further monetary policy easing.     On balance, short-term market interest rates posted mixed changes over     the intermeeting period, while intermediate- and long-term rates rose     appreciably. With unexpectedly favorable corporate earnings reports     outweighing the effects of higher interest rates, major indexes of     equity prices were up moderately on balance over the period.In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the     dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies appreciated substantially     over the intermeeting period. The dollar's gain occurred partly in     response to the improving outlook for the U.S. economy and the related     rise in long-term interest rates in the United States. Declines in     long-term yields in the major European industrial countries probably     contributed to a higher value of the dollar in terms of the German     mark and most other European currencies. In addition, the dollar     appreciated sharply against the Japanese yen, largely in response to     actions by Japanese authorities to reduce official interest rates, to     encourage capital outflows from Japan, and to make large intervention     purchases of dollars during a period when the dollar already was     rising against the yen.M2 and M3 continued to register sizable increases in July and     appeared to be expanding considerably further in August. The recent     strength of M2 seemed to reflect in part the relatively greater appeal     of interest rates on M2 assets in the wake of the declines in market     interest rates that had taken place this year, particularly at longer     maturities. Robust M3 growth was associated with the continuing     requirements of commercial banks for additional wholesale funds needed     to meet persisting strong loan growth. For the year through July, M2     expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995, and M3     grew at a rate above its upwardly revised range. Total domestic     nonfinancial debt had been in the upper half of its monitoring range     in recent months.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that     growth in economic activity would pick up from the weak pace of the     second quarter. The inventory adjustment process appeared to be well     under way, and moderate expansion of final sales would be supported by     the favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally     in the debt and equity markets. In response to improved financial     conditions and balance sheets, consumer spending was anticipated to     keep pace with the growth of incomes. Homebuilding was expected to     strengthen somewhat in response to the earlier decline in mortgage     rates and the related improvement in housing affordability.     Accompanying slower growth of sales and profits, business investment     in new equipment and structures was projected to slow from the very     rapid pace of the past few years, although the lower cost of capital     and the ready availability of financing would help to sustain     appreciable expansion in such investment. Export growth would pick up     in response to some expected strengthening in the economies of major     trading partners. Considerable uncertainty surrounded the fiscal     outlook, but the staff continued to anticipate the greater degree of     fiscal restraint that had been projected at the time of the last     Committee meeting. In the staff's judgment, the prospects for some     further easing of pressure on labor and other resources suggested that     price inflation likely would not deviate significantly from recent     trends.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective     economic developments, the members focused on recent indications of     some strengthening in the expansion of economic activity after a     period of limited growth during the spring. Further growth in final     demand was generating an improvement in overall business activity,     despite a more rapid adjustment in inventory investment than many had     expected. This configuration suggested that the risks of recession or     an extended period of subpar growth were now reduced, and sustained     expansion at a moderate pace was seen as the most likely course for     the economy. Although the risks to the economy now seemed to be more     evenly balanced than at the time of the July meeting, they were still     sizable in both directions. In particular, uncertainties about     federal budget policies and their effects on the economy remained     substantial. With respect to prices, members noted that the recent     pause in the expansion had eased pressures on resources, and the     economy appeared to be in a better position to accommodate moderate     growth over the forecast horizon without adding to inflation. Indeed,     some members were optimistic that growth of the economy at a pace in     line with their expectations would be consistent with modest further     decreases in inflation. Others expressed concern, however, that the     uncertainties surrounding the outlook for the economy included     questions about the persistence of inflationary sentiment and the     prospects for further progress toward stable prices over the next     several quarters.Members gave particular attention to the ongoing discussions     involving the Congress and the Administration regarding future federal     budget deficits. There was a great deal of political support for     reducing the federal deficit substantially over the years ahead;     indeed, in the view of one member the political dynamics might very     well result in larger reductions than many now anticipated.     Nonetheless, the actual outcome remained particularly uncertain. From     the perspective of its macroeconomic stabilization effects and its     implications for monetary policy, enactment of legislation involving     substantial fiscal restraint would raise the issue of fiscal drag;     however, the latter's impact on the economy would have to be judged in     the context of attendant adjustments in market interest rates and,     more broadly, in the light of emerging economic conditions. A     legislative package containing strong fiscal restraint measures would     be expected to ease pressures in debt markets--indeed, enhanced     prospects in this regard were probably already contributing to reduced     long-term interest rates. On the other hand, a package that included     only modest deficit reduction might well lead to upward pressure on     interest rates. The continuing uncertainty concerning the size of     future budget deficits might be complicated by a delay in passing     appropriations legislation in the months ahead, with potentially     dislocative effects on many federal government operations.     Accordingly, federal budget developments were seen as the major factor     likely to bear on the performance of the economy over coming months     and quarters, and these developments might well differ considerably     from current forecasts.Members described current business conditions across the     nation as ranging from sluggish in some regions to robust in a number     of others, with at least some improvement occurring recently in many     parts of the country. There were anecdotal reports of strengthening     retail sales in numerous areas, with the notable exception of motor     vehicles, and of relatively high levels of confidence among consumers     and many retailers. Sustained growth in consumer spending was seen as     a reasonable expectation for the projection period through 1996.     However, diminished pent-up demands and possibly the increasing level     of consumer indebtedness would tend to inhibit consumer spending,     keeping its growth below that in recent years. These negative factors     might be offset to some extent by the wealth effects of the rise in     stock market prices and by a higher level of housing activity that     should help to support demands for household durables.Members referred to recent indications, including widespread     anecdotal reports, of considerable gains in housing activity after a     period of pronounced weakness during the earlier months of the year.     Homebuyers were reacting favorably to the declines in rates on fixed-rate mortgages from their highs around the turn of the year.     Homebuilders in a number of areas were reported to be optimistic about     the outlook for further gains in housing demand, at least for single-family homes. The prospects for multifamily construction seemed less     promising; while robust activity characterized such construction in a     number of areas, still high vacancy rates and associated overbuilding     across much of the nation suggested little, if any, overall impetus     from this sector of the housing industry.The expansion in nonresidential construction was projected to     slow from its pace in recent quarters in line with more moderate     growth in overall economic activity and reduced pressures on capacity.     Even so, with the slowing occurring only gradually as projects under     construction were completed, this sector of the economy was expected     to remain a positive factor in the overall expansion of economic     activity over the next several quarters. The members also anticipated     more moderate growth in outlays for producers' durable equipment over     the forecast horizon in conjunction with slower growth in final sales.     However, current trends pointed to further sizable increases in     outlays for office and computing equipment, and such expenditures were     expected to buttress still considerable overall growth in spending for     business equipment, though at a pace well below the exceptional rate     experienced in recent years.Members commented that the adjustment in business inventories     appeared to have progressed a considerable distance but probably was     not yet completed for the business sector as a whole. Nonetheless,     inventory investment seemed likely to become a more neutral factor in     its effects on the overall economy as desired inventory ratios were     reached in an increasing number of industries. The recent tendency     for order patterns to stabilize was a tentative indication of such a     development. In any event, the recent upturn in final sales, apart     from its probable effects on desired inventory levels, had allowed a     larger-than-expected amount of inventory correction to occur without     preventing the economy from regaining at least moderate expansionary     momentum.The external sector of the economy remained subject to     particular uncertainty. The members generally viewed some improvement     in the country's net export position as a reasonable expectation, but     several questioned the potential for much expansion of exports to many     of the nation's important trading partners. While recent policy     actions in Japan might have diminished concerns about the outlook for     overall exports, a number of members indicated that they continued to     anticipate fairly limited growth in foreign demands for U.S. goods and     services, with the result that the external sector was likely in their     view to make a relatively small, if any, contribution to the growth of     the domestic economy over the projection period.Members generally viewed the near-term outlook for inflation     as more encouraging than it had appeared to be earlier this year. The     pause in the expansion during the spring had eased pressures on     resources, as evidenced in part by anecdotal reports of lessening     labor shortages in some areas and reduced use of overtime work by some     firms, and the higher rate of inflation experienced during the early     months of the year seemed unlikely to persist. The members differed     somewhat, however, in their assessment of the longer-term outlook for     inflation. Some emphasized the reduction that had occurred in     inflationary pressures, and with labor costs remaining subdued they     felt that economic growth in line with current forecasts should prove     compatible with moderating inflation over time. Further, the recent     appreciation of the dollar should contribute marginally to a more     favorable inflation outcome after some lag. Other members expressed     reservations about the prospects for an improved inflation performance     over coming quarters. They cited indications of persisting     inflationary expectations such as the recent weakness of the bond     markets and survey results that pointed to expectations of some rise     in inflation from current levels. They also referred to the     possibility that favorable labor cost developments would not persist     indefinitely in an economy that was operating in the vicinity of its     potential.Turning to monetary policy for the intermeeting period ahead,     all the members accepted a proposal to maintain an unchanged degree of     pressure in reserve markets and to adopt a directive that was not     biased in either direction with regard to potential intermeeting     adjustments. For the near term, current trends in economic activity     and inflation appeared favorable and likely to remain so with an     unchanged policy stance. A steady policy also seemed appropriate     pending a clearer assessment of the outlook for fiscal policy. Over     the longer term, the members generally believed that consideration     would need to be given to an adjustment in the Committee's policy     stance, especially if substantial fiscal restraint were to be enacted.     The extent to which an adjustment might be needed later in the stance     of monetary policy --characterized by some members as slightly to the     restrictive side at least in terms of the inflation-adjusted federal     funds rate --would have to be assessed in terms of its consistency     with the Committee's continuing objectives of fostering price     stability and promoting sustained economic growth.At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the     members indicated that they would vote for a directive that called for     maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.     They also favored a directive that did not include a presumption about     the likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the     intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's     long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic     growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and     monetary developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or     slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the     intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this     meeting were expected to be consistent with more moderate growth in M2     and M3 over the months ahead.At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of     New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by     the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in     accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests       a strengthening in the expansion of economic activity       in the current quarter from the weak second-quarter       pace. Nonfarm payroll employment increased in June and       July after declining in May; the advance was held down       by continuing employment losses in manufacturing. The       civilian unemployment rate in July was at its second-quarter average of 5.7 percent. Industrial production       changed little in recent months after falling earlier       while capacity utilization was down somewhat further.       Total retail sales have risen appreciably on balance       since early spring, but they edged down in July,       reflecting weakness in motor vehicles. Housing starts       were up sharply in July after changing little in       previous months. Orders for nondefense capital goods       still point to considerable further expansion of       spending on business equipment over coming months;       nonresidential construction has continued to trend       appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade       in goods and services widened in the second quarter       from its average rate in the first quarter. After       increasing at elevated rates in the early part of the       year, consumer and producer prices have risen more       slowly in recent months. Advances in labor       compensation costs have remained subdued.Short-term interest rates have posted mixed       changes since the Committee meeting on July 5-6, while       intermediate- and long-term rates have risen appreciably. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted       value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10       currencies appreciated substantially over the       intermeeting period, with the gain occurring since the       beginning of August.M2 and M3 continued to register sizable increases       in July and appeared to be expanding considerably       further in August. For the year through July, M2       expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for       1995 and M3 grew at a rate above its upwardly revised       range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at a       rate in the upper half of its monitoring range in       recent months.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary       and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In       furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its       meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established       on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5       percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to       the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also       retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the       year that it had set for growth of total domestic       nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range       for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to       take account of changing intermediation patterns. For       1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis       the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary       aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter       of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of       the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated       in the light of progress toward price level stability,       movements in their velocities, and developments in the       economy and financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate       future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing       degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the       context of the Committee's long-run objectives for       price stability and sustainable economic growth, and       giving careful consideration to economic, financial,       and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve       restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be       acceptable in the intermeeting period. The       contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be       consistent with more moderate growth in M2 and M3 over       coming months.Votes for this action: Messrs.

Attended portion of meeting relating to the Committee\\'s economic   discussion.By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal     Open Market Committee held on August 22, 1995, were approved.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on     developments in foreign exchange markets since the August meeting.     There were no transactions in these markets for the System Account     during this period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.The Manager also reported on developments in domestic     financial markets and on System open market transactions in government     securities and federal agency obligations during the period August 22,     1995, through September 25, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee     ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and     financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the     intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial     information available at the time of the meeting and of the     Committee\\'s discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic     policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the     Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that     economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate in the current     quarter. Consumer spending appeared to be advancing somewhat further     after a sizable gain in the second quarter; housing demand had     strengthened in response to earlier reductions in mortgage rates; and     business investment remained on a solid uptrend. Although business     efforts to pare inventories apparently were still in progress, both     production and employment were advancing moderately. After having     increased at elevated rates in the early part of the year, consumer     and producer prices had risen more slowly in recent months.Private nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably in     August after changing little in July. Much of the rise reflected a     pickup in hiring in the services industry, notably in business     services. Manufacturing payrolls were up modestly in August; the gain     followed substantial declines in the previous four months.     Construction employment changed little on balance over July and     August, with only small changes being posted each month. The civilian     unemployment rate edged down to 5.6 percent in August, remaining in     the narrow range that had prevailed since late 1994.Industrial production jumped in August to a level moderately     above its average for the second quarter. Manufacturing output rose     sharply, posting its first increase since January; a surge in the     production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for some of the     advance, but the output of non-automotive consumer goods in August     more than reversed a sizable drop in July, and the production of     business equipment recorded another robust gain. A steep rise in     electricity generation associated with unusually hot weather over much     of the country more than offset a decline in mining production. Total     utilization of industrial capacity moved higher in August but remained     below the average rate for the first quarter.Retail sales were up slightly on balance over July and August     after rising appreciably in the previous two months. Abstracting from     the volatile sales of motor vehicles during this period, spending on     goods changed little on balance over the two months, as increased     outlays for durable goods were offset by flagging purchases of     apparel. Spending on services rose in July (latest data available) owing in part to elevated demand for energy-related services during     that month\\'s unseasonably warm weather. Housing market activity     increased further in July and August. Sales of both new and existing     homes in July (latest data) reached their highest levels in more than     a year, and housing starts edged up in August after a substantial rise     in July.Shipments of nondefense capital goods fell appreciably in     July after having risen rapidly over the first half of the year, and     sales of heavy trucks also were down substantially. New orders for     nondefense capital goods declined steeply in July: however, the still-large backlog of outstanding orders, coupled with the favorable     effects on the user cost of capital of lower interest rates and higher     equity prices this year, pointed to further substantial expansion of     spending on business equipment over coming months. Nonresidential     construction posted another sizable gain in July. Outlays for office,     industrial, and institutional structures registered healthy increases,     but other commercial building activity was unchanged.Business inventory accumulation slowed in June and July from     a very rapid rate earlier in the year: stockpiling continued at a     brisk pace in manufacturing and wholesale trade, but retail stocks     were drawn down. In manufacturing, stocks increased in July at about     the average rate seen in the second quarter; however, the stocks-to-shipments ratio rose somewhat, reflecting in part a reduction in     shipments that might have been exaggerated by difficulties of seasonal     adjustment. Wholesale inventories also advanced at about the second-quarter pace, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector moved     up to the upper end of its range for recent years. At the retail     level, reduced stocks at automotive dealers accounted for much of the     July decline in inventories; the ratio of inventories to sales edged     lower but remained near the middle of the range for recent years.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services     widened slightly in July from its average rate in the second quarter.     The value of both exports and imports decreased. For exports, the     largest decline was in aircraft and automotive products. The decrease     in imports was concentrated in automotive products and gold.     Available indicators of economic activity suggested that expansion was     continuing in most of the major foreign industrial countries in the     third quarter and that the average rate of growth remained near the     subdued pace of the first half of the year.As in other recent months, consumer prices rose more slowly     in August than in the early months of the year. Sizable declines in     energy prices were a contributing factor, but price increases also had     moderated for nonfood, non-energy items; the moderation largely     reflected a downturn in automobile finance charges and used-car prices     along with smaller increases in airline fares. For the twelve months     ending in August, nonfood, non-energy prices rose by the same amount     as in the year-earlier period. At the producer level, prices of     finished goods edged lower in August after being unchanged in July.     Although declines in prices of finished energy goods held down the     overall index in both months, prices of finished goods other than food     and energy rose more slowly than in the early months of the year; for     the twelve months ending in August, nonfood, non-energy prices of     finished goods increased slightly more than in the comparable year-earlier period.At its meeting on August 22, 1995, the Committee adopted a     directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure     on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the     likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting     period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee\\'s     long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic     growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and     monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly     lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting     period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were     expected to be consistent with more moderate growth of M2 and M3 over     coming months.Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the     existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the     intermeeting period. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing and the     federal funds rate generally were in line with expectations, with the     funds rate averaging close to 5-3/4 percent. Other market interest     rates fell appreciably over much of the period, though these declines     were partially reversed near the end of the period. Further evidence     of subdued price pressures, indications that the rebound in growth of     GDP would be modest, and increasing confidence that significant     reductions in federal deficits might be in train contributed to the     drop in rates. The lower interest rates, optimistic assessments of     corporate earnings, and the brisk pace of merger announcements and     share buybacks helped lift major indexes of equity prices to new     record levels during the period, though they ended the period below     those highs.In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the     dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined over the     intermeeting period. The dollar moved higher over most of the period,     partly in response to monetary easing actions in Germany, which were     quickly followed by similar steps in other European countries, and in     Japan. The policy easing in Japan was accompanied, inter alia, by     statements by U.S. and Japanese officials that they would welcome a     weaker yen. The dollar reversed course late in the intermeeting     period, however, following the announcement of a new Japanese fiscal     package and emerging uncertainties about the prospects for European     monetary union. On balance over the period, the dollar moved lower     against most European currencies while appreciating significantly     further against the yen.After further strong expansion in August, M2 and M3 appeared     to be growing at a somewhat more moderate rate in September. The     still-brisk demand for M2 assets was associated with the lower market     interest rates now prevailing and the related decline in the opportunity costs associated with holding these assets. The relatively     robust growth of M3 reflected inflows to institution-only money market     funds as well as bank acquisitions of wholesale funds to meet loan     demand. For the year through August, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat     below the upper end of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate     appreciably above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had     grown at a rate around the midpoint of its monitoring range in recent     months.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that     growth in economic activity over the forecast horizon would be higher     than the weak pace of the second quarter. The process of bringing     inventories into better alignment with sales was well under way, and     the favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally     in the debt and equity markets would tend to support moderate     expansion of final sales. Consumer spending was expected to grow at a     pace generally in line with incomes; the favorable effects on spending     of higher prices for financial assets held by households would be     offset to a degree in this forecast by less robust labor market     conditions and the difficulties that growing numbers of households     would encounter in servicing their enlarged debts. Homebuilding was     expected to be somewhat stronger in response to the earlier decline in     mortgage rates and the related improvement in housing affordability.     In anticipation of slower growth of sales and profits, business     investment in new equipment and structures was projected to slow from     the very rapid pace of the past few years, although the lower cost of     capital and the ready availability of financing would help to sustain     appreciable expansion in such investment. Export growth would pick up     in response to some expected strengthening in the economies of major     trading partners. A great deal of uncertainty surrounded the fiscal     outlook, but the staff continued to build a considerable degree of     fiscal restraint into its forecast. In the staff\\'s judgment, the     prospects for some further easing of pressures on labor and other     resources suggested that price inflation likely would not deviate     significantly from recent trends.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective     economic developments, members commented that the information     available since the August meeting had tended to confirm earlier     indications of a pickup in the expansion after a period of sluggish     growth during the spring. The economy did not display uniform     strength across industries or regions, but it appeared on balance to     have considerable and desirable expansionary momentum. Growth at a     pace averaging close to, or perhaps slightly below, the economy\\'s     potential was viewed as the most likely prospect for the year ahead.     The outlook for economic activity remained subject to a variety of     uncertainties, including the still unsettled course of the federal     budget, and many members saw the risks of a shortfall from expectations as slightly greater than those of significantly faster growth.     With regard to inflation, the slower increases in key measures of     consumer and producer prices since earlier in the year were a welcome     development, and a number of members commented that inflation was     likely to remain contained, given likely developments. Many expressed     concern, however, that significant further progress toward achieving     stable prices might not be made over the next year or two.In keeping with indicators of nationwide economic performance, anecdotal and other reports on regional activity suggested     somewhat uneven business conditions in different parts of the country,     but collectively the reports pointed to moderate overall growth.     Business activity in most regions had tended to improve or to remain     firm during the summer months, though declining growth or very     sluggish activity characterized some areas. The level of business     confidence generally appeared to have stayed high, but several members     indicated that they sensed from their contacts that business     expectations were somewhat fragile and vulnerable to adverse     developments.In their discussion of developments in key sectors of the     economy, members generally viewed comparatively moderate growth in     consumer spending as a likely prospect over the forecast period.     After recording sizable gains in late spring, retail sales had been     well maintained in recent months, with some strengthening in the motor     vehicles sector in August apparently carrying over to September.     Favorable factors in the outlook for consumer spending included the     increases that had occurred in the value of financial assets and the     demand for household appliances and other durables that was expected     to be generated by stronger housing activity. On the other hand,     overall gains in consumer spending were likely to be restrained by     cyclically waning pent-up demands for consumer durables, especially     motor vehicles; still widespread concerns about job security     associated with ongoing business restructuring and downsizing     activities; and higher consumer debt loads.Housing demand was continuing to respond to more attractive     mortgage rates, as evidenced by nationwide data and anecdotal reports     from many parts of the country. Increases in construction activity     were lagging the improvement in housing demand and had been limited     thus far, but considerable strength in homebuilding activity could be     expected over the next several months. The extent of further lagged     responses to reduced mortgage rates could not be foreseen with any     degree of certainty, and in any event housing demand would depend on     broad economic developments such as trends in employment and income.     Housing activity appeared to have weakened over recent months in one     major market where economic conditions were described as relatively     sluggish. In many other areas, however, persons in the real estate     industry were reported to be optimistic about the outlook for housing.Business fixed investment remained a strongly positive factor     in the economy and was expected to provide further impetus to growth     over the next several quarters. The contribution of this sector could     be expected to lessen, however, as capital spending was adjusted to     expectations of a maturing expansion characterized by the emergence of     slower growth in final demand and business profits. In particular,     the outsized growth in business spending for equipment did not appear     to be sustainable under foreseeable economic conditions.Diminished growth in inventories still seemed to be retarding     the expansion in overall business activity, as evidenced in part by     continuing reports of efforts by various business firms to bring their     inventories into better balance with sales. Nonetheless, such     adjustments now appeared to have been largely completed, or were     expected to be completed over the months immediately ahead, so that     inventory investment could be expected to have little effect on the     course of the economy during 1996. It was noted, however, that     projections of inventory behavior were subject to a high degree of     uncertainty.A number of members commented that fiscal policy developments     constituted a major uncertainty in the outlook for economic activity.     While measures incorporating substantial reductions in spending from     current trends were widely expected to be enacted into law, it was not     possible to predict the outcome of the continuing debate on the     federal budget in the Congress and the Administration. Further     complicating any efforts to assess the potential damping influence of     prospective fiscal policy were uncertainties regarding the time frame     during which the new expenditure and tax measures would be put in     place--including the extent to which they would be implemented over     the year ahead--and the effects of the new fiscal measures on economic     incentives and financial markets. Favorable business and financial     market reactions would tend to mitigate, at least for a time, the     restraining effects of fiscal measures on aggregate demand. On the     other hand, if the deficit reduction measures that eventually were     enacted were to fall substantially short of current expectations,     there would be adverse repercussions in financial markets and possibly     on business confidence.The nation\\'s trade deficit was expected to diminish somewhat     over the next several quarters and in the process to exert less     restraint on domestic economic activity. The better trade performance     was projected to result from a number of factors, including the     improved competitive position of U.S. producers and the lagged effects     of earlier declines in the value of the dollar in foreign exchange     markets. It also was associated with forecasts of somewhat stronger     growth in economic activity abroad than in the United States. While     there were continuing anecdotal reports of expanding export markets,     some members expressed reservations about the extent to which the     economies of major foreign trading partners would strengthen over the     forecast period and the related prospects for growth of foreign demand     for U.S. goods and services.Views on the outlook for inflation centered on forecasts of     little change or some slight decline in the rate of increase in     consumer prices over the year ahead. The appreciable moderation in     inflation in recent months had checked the deteriorating trend that     seemed to be emerging during the early months of the year, but the     members generally believed that recent developments did not point to a     significant further decline in inflation. Pressures on producer     resources had eased since the early part of the year, but the labor     market remained tight and capacity utilization was still above its     historical average. In this connection, a few members commented that     current forecasts were subject to a range of error that included a     risk of some intensification of inflationary pressures.One uncertainty bearing on the outlook for inflation was the     extent to which potentially greater pressures on labor costs would be     translated into higher prices. Increases in labor expenses had been     held down by markedly reduced advances in the costs of benefits,     notably medical benefits. The economies from the latter source might     well lessen over coming quarters as the most easily implemented     reductions in the costs of providing medical care were achieved.     Moreover, the rise in worker compensation had been unusually     restrained in recent years in relation to the strong demand for     workers, evidently reflecting the effects of worker concerns about job     security in a period of business restructurings and downsizings, but     continued strength in the demand for labor might be expected to induce     more rapid increases in labor compensation over time. Some members     commented, however, that the underlying factors affecting employment     costs were not likely to change greatly over the forecast period. In     addition, the prospect that intense competitive pressures would     persist in many markets under projected economic conditions suggested     that business firms would continue to find it very difficult to pass     on rising costs through higher prices. It also was possible that the     rates of capacity utilization and employment associated with a steady     rate of inflation had changed in the direction of providing the     economy greater leeway to operate at a somewhat higher level without     generating more inflation.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting     period ahead, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an     unchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions. The expansion     seemed for now to have a desirable and sustainable momentum that did     not call for any change in policy. Furthermore, the outlook remained     clouded by the uncertainties stemming from the ongoing federal budget     debate. In any event, the Committee would need to remain alert to a     broader range of developments that might warrant a policy change at     some point. In this connection, several members expressed the opinion     that policy might have to be eased eventually in light of the downside     risks that they saw in the economy and a current policy stance that     they viewed as slightly restrictive. However, the current performance     of the economy suggested that the timing of an easing action was not     an immediate concern. Other members who preferred an unchanged policy     placed more emphasis on current forecasts of little or no progress in     reducing inflation from recent levels. They thought it would be     premature to ease policy without greater assurance that inflation had     been contained in the current cyclical expansion and that prospects     for significant further progress toward the long-run objective of     price level stability had improved. Indeed, the direction of the next     policy move was not clear in the view of some members, and they     believed that any easing should await a firm indication that the     outlook for economic activity was becoming less favorable or that     inflation was decreasing more rapidly than expected.With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the     intermeeting period, the members all endorsed a proposal to retain an     intermeeting instruction in the directive that did not incorporate any     bias concerning the direction of possible intermeeting policy changes.     At this juncture, there was no specific reason to anticipate     developments that would call for an adjustment to policy during the     weeks ahead. While a change in policy certainly could not be ruled     out, the reasons for the change likely would involve sensitive issues     that would warrant Committee consultation regardless of the     intermeeting instruction.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all the     members indicated a preference for a directive that called for     maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and     that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any     adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in     the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability     and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to     economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided     that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be     acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions     contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with     growth in M2 and M3 over the balance of the year at a pace near that     experienced in recent months.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and     directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute     transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following     domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests       that economic activity is expanding at a moderate rate       in the current quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment       increased considerably in August after essentially no       growth in July; the civilian unemployment rate edged       down to 5.6 percent in August. Industrial production       posted a large increase in August to a level moderately       above the average of the second quarter. Total nominal       retail sales rose slightly on balance over July and       August after registering appreciable gains in the prior       two months. Housing starts were up a little in August       after increasing sharply in July. Orders for nondefense capital goods have softened but still point to       substantial expansion of spending on business equipment       over coming months; nonresidential construction has       been strong of late. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade       in goods and services widened slightly in July from its       average rate in the second quarter. After increasing       at elevated rates in the early part of the year,       consumer and producer prices have risen more slowly in       recent months.Market interest rates have fallen somewhat since       the Committee meeting on August 22. In foreign       exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the       dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has       declined over the intermeeting period, with most of the       decline occurring over the past several days.M2 and M3 continued to register sizable increases       in August but growth of those aggregates appears to       have moderated somewhat in September. For the year       through August, M2 expanded at a rate somewhat below       the upper end of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a       rate appreciably above its range. Total domestic       nonfinancial debt has grown at a rate around the       midpoint of its monitoring range in recent months.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary       and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In       furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its       meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established       on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5       percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to       the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also       retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the       year that it had set for growth of total domestic       nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range       for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to       take account of changing intermediation patterns. For       1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis       the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary       aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter       of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of       the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated       in the light of progress toward price level stability,       movements in their velocities, and developments in the       economy and financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate       future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing       degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the       context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for       price stability and sustainable economic growth, and       giving careful consideration to economic, financial,       and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve       restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be       acceptable in the intermeeting period. The       contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be       consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the balance of       the year near the pace of recent months.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan       McDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey,       Melzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips       and Yellen.Votes against this action: None.Discussion of Proposed LegislationAt this meeting, the Committee discussed a bill, titled the     \"Economic Growth and Price Stability Act of 1995,\" that recently had     been introduced in the United States Senate. The bill would make     price stability the primary long-run policy goal of the Federal     Reserve and require the Federal Reserve to establish a numerical     definition of price stability and to implement a policy that would     effectively promote such stability over time. It would repeal the     Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the \"Humphrey-Hawkins     Act\") and certain related provisions in the Employment Act of 1946 and     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Federal Reserve had not yet     been asked its views of the bill, but testimony was likely at some     point and a preliminary discussion would help to identify important     issues.The members had not had time to review the bill in detail or     to consider fully all its implications. Nonetheless, their initial     reaction was favorable in regard to the overall thrust of the bill\\'s     monetary policy provisions. These would make clear that price     stability was the primary long-run objective of monetary policy and     would restructure the monetary policy reporting requirements to permit     the Congress to carry out its oversight responsibilities more     effectively. Many members felt that in the context of seeking and     maintaining price stability, monetary policy should have the     flexibility to react to short-run fluctuations in output and     employment, and they believed the bill would be improved if its intent     in this regard were clarified. A few members expressed strong     reservations about the part of the bill that would delete the     employment objectives set forth in the Employment Act of 1946.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be     held on Wednesday.

A summary of the economic and financial     information available at the time of the meeting and of the     Committee\\'s discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic     policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the     Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information available at the time of the meeting was     mixed, but on balance it suggested a more moderate rate of expansion     of economic activity after a strong gain during the summer. Consumer     spending had turned sluggish recently; but with order backlogs still     large, business spending for durable equipment was continuing at a     robust if somewhat less rapid rate, and the sizable rise in housing     starts in the third quarter presaged higher residential construction     outlays. Appreciable increases in employment and hours worked tended     to confirm that the economy had continued to expand at a solid pace,     although manufacturing activity had weakened a little. Consumer and     producer prices had risen more slowly on average in recent months     after having increased at elevated rates in the early part of the     year, and growth in labor costs had slowed further.Nonfarm payroll employment, though held down somewhat by the     onset of a labor strike in the aircraft industry, increased in October     at the average monthly pace of the third quarter; in addition,     aggregate hours worked by private production workers rose appreciably     further. Construction payrolls recorded another sizable advance. The     rate of job growth in the services industry slowed a little further,     reflecting a decline in employment in personnel supply services after     two months of strong advances. Manufacturing employment declined     again. The civilian unemployment rate edged down in October to 5.5     percent.Industrial production fell somewhat in October after having     risen appreciably in the third quarter; most of the loss reflected the     strike in the aircraft industry, but motor vehicle production and     mining output also recorded substantial declines. In contrast,     production of information processing equipment continued to rise at a     rapid pace. Total utilization of industrial capacity contracted in     October, with declines widespread across industries.Total nominal retail sales, which had expanded relatively     briskly over the second and third quarters, fell in October. As part     of a pattern of widespread weakness in October, purchases at furniture     and appliance stores were down appreciably after large gains in     earlier months, and sales at general merchandise and apparel outlets     reversed most of their sizable September increases. Housing demand     and construction activity firmed in the third quarter: Sales of both     new and existing homes posted solid advances, and single-family     housing starts rose considerably, though multifamily starts remained     sluggish.Business investment in both equipment and structures expanded     less rapidly in the third quarter. Stepped-up shipments of nondefense     capital goods in August and September more than offset a sharp drop in     shipments in July, but the quarterly average gain was significantly     smaller than the increases recorded in the previous two quarters.     Although orders for nondefense capital goods also rose more slowly in     the third quarter, the still-sizable order backlogs pointed to     substantial expansion of spending on business equipment in the near     term. Nonresidential construction increased appreciably further in     the third quarter, reflecting a surge in office and institutional     building activity.Available data suggested a reduction in business inventory     accumulation in August and September. In manufacturing, the pace of     stockbuilding slowed in the third quarter from the brisk rate of the     first half of the year, leaving the factory stock-shipments ratio     unchanged in the third quarter and a little above historic lows. In     the wholesale sector, inventories were drawn down in August and     September after sizable buildups in earlier months; with sales weak,     the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector edged up in the     third quarter and was at the upper end of its range for recent years.     Retail inventories expanded significantly in August (latest data     available), but the stockbuilding was generally in line with sales and     the ratio of inventories to sales remained near the middle of its     range in recent years.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services     narrowed markedly in August; for July and August-combined, the deficit     was significantly smaller than its average rate in the second quarter.     The value of exports declined over the two-month period, with     increases in exports of computers and agricultural products more than     offset by decreases in exports of aircraft, gold, and service     receipts. Imports fell more than exports; with the notable exception     of computers and semiconductors, declines were recorded in most major     import categories. Available data indicated that economic expansion     remained subdued in the major foreign industrial countries. Growth     continued to slow in the European economies other than Italy, and the     Japanese economy showed little evidence of a sustained recovery.Consumer prices rose at a slightly faster rate in October;     with a smaller increase in food prices offsetting higher energy     prices, the index for items other than food and energy also picked up     a little. For the four months ending in October, prices for nonfood,     non-energy items advanced at a rate well below that of earlier in the     year. Producer prices of finished goods edged down in October,     reflecting a further decline in the prices of finished energy goods.     Excluding food and energy, producer prices were unchanged in October     and increased at a slower pace in the third quarter than in the first     half of the year. Growth in total nominal hourly compensation of     private industry workers slowed in the third quarter and, on a year-over-year basis, continued to trend down: the decrease in compensation     growth over the past year spanned most major occupations and     industries.At its meeting on September 26, 1995, the Committee adopted a     directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure     on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the     likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting     period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee\\'s     long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic     growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and     monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly     lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting     period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were     expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the balance of     the year at a pace near that experienced in recent months.Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the     existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the     intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged close to 5-3/4     percent, apart from a temporary rise around the end of the third     quarter. Other short-term market rates also changed little on     balance; market participants continued to anticipate an easing of     monetary policy at some point but apparently viewed the chances of     near-term easing as small. Longer-term interest rates declined     further over the intermeeting period, perhaps in response to a growing     conviction that inflation pressures would remain subdued and that     substantial reductions in fiscal deficits would be achieved over a     period of years. The lower longer-term interest rates, coupled with     continuing reports of strong corporate earnings, helped lift major     indexes of equity prices to new record levels during the period. In     foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in     terms of the other G-10 currencies declined slightly over the     intermeeting period.Expansion of the broad monetary aggregates weakened in     October. M2 was unchanged in October after having grown relatively     rapidly in the third quarter and despite the persistence of low     opportunity costs associated with holding M2 assets. For the year     through October, M2 expanded at a rate in the upper half of the     Committee\\'s range for this aggregate in 1995. Growth of M3 apparently     was held down somewhat by the reduced need for additional bank funding     during a time of sluggish loan demand; for the year to date, M3 grew     at a rate a little above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt     had risen more slowly in recent months, reflecting reduced expansion     of both private and federal borrowing. Nonetheless, for the year to     date, this measure of debt remained around the midpoint of its     monitoring range.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that     the growth of economic activity would slow from the strong third-quarter pace to a rate more in line with the increase in the economy\\'s     potential. The forecast assumed that the favorable interest-rate and     wealth effects of the extended rally in the debt and equity markets     would provide support for a moderate advance in final sales. Consumer     spending was expected to expand at a rate generally in line with the     growth of incomes; the favorable effects of higher prices on financial     assets held by households would be offset to some extent by the     difficulties of increasing numbers of households in servicing their     growing debts. The greater affordability of housing stemming from the     earlier decline in mortgage rates was projected to help sustain     homebuilding activity at a relatively high level. In anticipation of     reduced growth in sales and profits, business investment in new     equipment and structures was projected to slow appreciably from the     very rapid pace of the past few years. Strong export expansion would     be associated with the improving outlook for the economies of major     trading partners. Although substantial uncertainty still surrounded     the fiscal outlook, the forecast continued to incorporate a     considerable degree of fiscal restraint. In the staff\\'s judgment,     wage and price inflation likely would not deviate significantly from     recent levels.In the Committee\\'s discussion, members commented that recent     statistical and anecdotal information pointed on balance to an     appreciable slowing in the economic expansion, which had displayed     unexpected strength during the summer months. There was some mix of     views among the members concerning how far the slowing might proceed,     though they generally viewed moderate growth as the most likely course     for the economy. A number of members believed that growth around     potential was a probable outcome, with business activity sustained in     part by the favorable developments this year in the bond and stock     markets. Other members expressed concern about some signs of further     ebbing in the strength of final demands, and they envisaged the     possible need for a policy adjustment at some point to sustain     continued moderate growth. With regard to inflation, members noted     that despite generally high levels of resource use, including tight     labor markets in many parts of the country, inflation had been more     subdued than many had expected over the past several months. A number     of members commented that they saw a basis in this development for     mild optimism about the outlook for inflation, but others expressed     concern that, in the context of current forecasts for economic     activity and relatively high levels of resource use, progress toward     lower inflation was unlikely over the projection period and indeed     there was a risk of some modest deterioration in price performance.In the course of the Committee\\'s discussion, members reported     on uneven business conditions in different parts of the country and     among industries. On balance, modest to moderate growth appeared to     characterize most regions, with overall levels of activity ranging     from relatively robust in some regions to comparatively depressed in     others. The mixed conditions were especially notable in manufacturing     where numerous producers faced lagging demands while others,     particularly in high-tech industries, found it difficult to satisfy     strong demands for their products. More generally, the industrial     sector of the economy had tended to stagnate for some time, including     a slight decline in manufacturing activity reported for October, but     recent improvement in orders for steel was cited as a favorable if not     decisive omen in the outlook for industrial production. In other     sectors of the economy, members observed that tourism displayed     considerable strength in many areas, while cattle operations and     energy production were adversely affected by high production costs or     low prices.In their review of developments in key demand sectors of the     economy, members observed that consumer spending appeared to be on a     firm growth trend, though weakness in overall sales of motor vehicles     in recent months and a decline in total retail sales in October had     introduced a cautionary note. It was suggested that the performance     of retail sales during the holiday season would tend to set the tone     for the longer-term trend in such sales, and in this respect available     data and anecdotal reports covering the first part of November were     somewhat promising. More generally, further growth in consumer     spending, though probably at a somewhat slower pace than over the past     year, appeared likely. Such growth would be supported by moderate     expansion in incomes and by the favorable effects on household wealth     and confidence of the substantial improvement in the value of     financial assets this year and the ready availability of financing on     relatively attractive terms. Consumer confidence currently seemed to     be at a fairly high level, albeit not uniformly so across the country,     and at least for the quarters immediately ahead, anticipated strength     in homebuilding should induce spending for many household durables.     On the negative side, some members emphasized that the growth in     consumer debt was likely to exert an increasingly inhibiting effect on     consumer spending. Moreover, the satisfaction of earlier pent-up     demands might well limit sales of many consumer durables, notably     motor vehicles, in coming quarters. In one view, the projected growth     in personal incomes and the increases that had occurred this year in     the value of household holdings of financial assets would provide     relatively little stimulus to consumer spending because the     distribution of such gains was heavily tilted toward consumers in     higher income or older age groups.Further sizable growth in business fixed investment, but at a     pace well below that experienced in recent years, was expected to     provide appreciable impetus to the expansion over the next several     quarters. Favorable factors in the outlook for business capital     spending included a desire to upgrade technological capabilities for     competitive reasons, strong business earnings and cash flows, and an     ample availability of financing on relatively liberal terms.     Declining office vacancy rates in a number of areas would help to     support office construction, and several members also commented on the     strength in commercial and other nonresidential building activity in     various parts of the country.Ongoing efforts by many business firms to bring inventories into better alignment with sales had resulted in declining inventory investment since earlier in the year. Some further inventory adjustments, notably in stocks of motor vehicles, were expected over coming months, though not at a pace that would have a marked retarding effect on economic activity. Over much of 1996, inventory investment was projected to be a more neutral factor in the economy, with accumulation proceeding at a pace in line with growth in final sales, but the risks of unexpected developments in this sector of the economy were always substantial.The outlook for fiscal policy remained obscured by the     uncertain outcome of the current debate between the Congress and the     Administration. While substantial fiscal restraint aimed at     eventually balancing the budget appeared to be the likely result, the     timing of the implementation of various tax and expenditure     initiatives and the resulting extent of the fiscal restraint over the     forecast period could not be anticipated with any degree of precision.     For the nearer term, the ongoing shutdown of much of the federal     government presented a downside risk to the expansion whose effects     would depend on the presently uncertain duration of the shutdown and     the potential unsettlement in financial markets that might develop at     some point. The members generally believed, however, that in light of     the underlying strength of the economy, the retarding effects of     likely federal budget developments would not be sufficient in     themselves to arrest the expansion over the forecast period, at least     if the federal government shutdown were of relatively short duration     and a federal debt default were averted.The nation\\'s foreign trade deficit had worsened substantially     during the past several years, but current forecasts did not point to     further deterioration over the projection period. An anticipated     firming in the economies of major U.S. trading partners was expected     to bolster exports. Several members questioned, however, the extent     to which forecasts of strengthening economic activity were likely to     materialize in a number of these countries, and they suggested that     the foreign sector might well remain a somewhat constraining factor in     the performance of the domestic economy.Members welcomed the generally favorable price and cost     developments of recent months and the related indications that     currently high levels of resource use did not appear to be associated     with rising inflationary pressures. Many emphasized the persistence     of subdued increases in labor costs, and a number provided supporting     anecdotal indications of relatively small advances in labor compensation in many parts of the country despite tight labor markets. The     anecdotal reports also continued to suggest that strong competition     was holding down price inflation and that producers were benefiting     from soft prices of industrial materials. While a number of members     believed that these developments might augur a modest decline in     inflation over the year ahead, given current forecasts of moderate     economic expansion, many viewed as more likely the prospect of little     or no progress toward price stability over coming quarters and some     expressed concern about the potential for an upward drift in the rate     of inflation. An underlying factor in the relatively favorable     climate for inflation was the continued limited rise in the costs of     worker benefits. In the view of some members, however, benefit costs     were likely to be less well contained as time went on and further     major gains in curbing such costs became more difficult to achieve.     Moreover, worker willingness to accept relatively limited increases in     wages and other compensation might well begin to erode as concerns     about job security tended to diminish after an extended period of     relatively low unemployment. On balance, recent experience had raised     questions about the relationship between levels of resource use and     inflation that warranted careful monitoring.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting     period ahead, all but one member favored or could accept an unchanged     policy stance. This policy position took account of current indications of a generally acceptable rate of economic growth and the     absence of any clear signs regarding the future strength of the     expansion in relation to the economy\\'s potential or the future course     of inflation. Several commented that current monetary policy might be     viewed as somewhat restrictive, though the degree of restraint was     difficult to calibrate and it did not appear as yet to be inhibiting     declines in intermediate- and long-term interest rates, increases in     stock prices, or the availability of financing from lending     institutions.Members expressed somewhat differing views regarding the     stance of monetary policy that was likely to prove consistent with the     Committee\\'s objectives over time. In the view of some, private     spending was not likely to have sufficient momentum to overcome the     effects of increased fiscal restraint if the current stance of     monetary policy were maintained. In the circumstances, an easing at     some point would be needed to foster sustained economic growth at an     acceptable pace and would be consistent with progress toward the     System\\'s price stability objective. For most of these members,     however, the stronger-than-expected performance of the economy in the     third quarter had reduced the urgency of such a policy move and had     created enough uncertainties to justify a careful appraisal of     unfolding developments before a decision was made to ease policy. In     the view of one member, the probability of a shortfall from an     acceptable rate of economic expansion was sufficiently high to require     an immediate easing of policy. Other members believed that an     unchanged policy was desirable under current conditions and that the     direction and timing of the next policy move was more open to     question. Not only were recent data giving an uncertain picture of     the underlying strength of aggregate demand, but current forecasts     generally did not point to progress toward the System\\'s long-run goal     of price stability. In this view, therefore, the current stance of     monetary policy, even if slightly restrictive, was likely to be     consistent with satisfactory economic growth over time and it would     provide better assurance of consolidating gains against inflation and     fostering some further moderation in price increases over coming     years. With regard to potential fiscal policy developments, although     an especially broad range of outcomes seemed possible, the members     agreed that the Committee could not freeze its policy options while it     awaited the outcome of a prolonged federal budget debate nor could it     commit itself to a specific response to a particular fiscal policy     agreement. Fiscal policy and any associated market reactions would be     among the many factors that would have to be taken into account in the     formulation of monetary policy.In the Committee\\'s discussion of possible intermeeting     adjustments to monetary policy, a majority of the members expressed a     preference for retaining a symmetric directive. In their view, the     potential need to adjust policy during the relatively short intermeeting period was remote and some of these members also believed that the     direction of the next adjustment to policy was uncertain. A few also     noted that the adoption of a biased intermeeting instruction at this     point might send an unintended message regarding the prevailing view     within the Committee concerning the risks to the expansion. The     remaining members said that they preferred a directive that was tilted     toward an easing policy action. Such an instruction in the directive     would be consistent with what they viewed as the most likely policy     course over coming months. They agreed, however, that the current     uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook were not likely to be     resolved during the weeks immediately ahead and since no policy action     was likely to be required in this period, they could accept a     symmetric directive.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all but one     of the members indicated that they could vote for a directive that     called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve     positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely     direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period.     Accordingly, in the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for     price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful     consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the     Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve     restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The     reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be     consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.The information reviewed at this meeting suggests       a moderation in the expansion of economic activity       after a strong gain in the third quarter. Nonfarm       payroll employment increased further in October and the       civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.5 percent.       Industrial production fell somewhat in October after a       moderate rise in the third quarter. Total nominal       retail sales were little changed on balance over       September and October. Single-family housing starts       were up considerably in the third quarter. Orders for       nondefense capital goods point to substantial expansion       of spending on business equipment in the near term;       nonresidential construction has risen appreciably       further. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods       and services narrowed over July and August from its       average rate in the second quarter. After increasing       at elevated rates in the early part of the year,       consumer and producer prices have risen more slowly on       average in recent months.Short-term market interest rates have changed       little on balance since the Committee meeting on       September 26 while long-term rates have fallen       somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10       currencies has declined slightly over the intermeeting       period.In October, M2 was unchanged and M3 growth       moderated. For the year through October, M2 expanded       at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995 and       M3 grew at a rate a little above its range. Growth in       total domestic nonfinancial debt has slowed somewhat in       recent months but for the year to date remains around       the midpoint of its monitoring range.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary       and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In       furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its       meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established       on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5       percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to       the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also       retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the       year that it had set for growth of total domestic       nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range       for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to       take account of changing intermediation patterns. For       1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis       the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary       aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter       of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of       the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated       in the light of progress toward price level stability,       movements in their velocities, and developments in the       economy and financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate       future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing       degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the       context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for       price stability and sustainable economic growth, and       giving careful consideration to economic, financial,       and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve       restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be       acceptable in the intermeeting period. The       contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be       consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over       coming months.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan       McDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Melzer,       Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips and       Yellen.Vote against this action: Mr. Lindsey.Mr. Lindsey dissented because he believed that monetary     policy should be eased. The evidence suggested to him that in the     absence of an easing move the underlying rate of nominal GDP growth     was likely to be lower than needed to maintain real GDP at or near its     potential. The intermediate forecast was subject to a number of     significant risks: household balance sheets seemed unlikely to sustain     the current rate of durables expenditure for any extended period;     government expenditures were certain to be cut substantially; and with     fiscal contractions underway in Europe and Canada and severe financial     stresses present in Japan and Mexico, he did not see much likelihood     of a substantial expansion of exports. In keeping with his views, the     financial markets were signalling the likelihood that a weaker pace of     nominal GDP growth would materialize. The yield curve was virtually     flat, with government securities up through relatively long maturities     trading at yields below the current average federal funds rate. Thus,     markets would be unlikely to find some easing inappropriate and over     the intermediate horizon would view the current level of short-term     rates as unsustainable.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be     held on Tuesday, December 19, 1995.The meeting adjourned at 1:35 p.m.Donald L.

Did not attend portion of meeting covering the monetary policy       discussion.By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal     Open Market Committee held on November 15, 1995, were approved.The Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account,     conducted by the Board\\'s Division of Reserve Bank Operations and     Payment Systems as of the close of business on September 29, 1995, was     accepted.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on     developments in foreign exchange markets during the period November     15, 1995, through December 18, 1995. There were no System open market     transactions in foreign currencies during this period, and thus no     vote was required of the Committee.The Manager also reported on developments in domestic     financial markets and on System open market transactions in government     securities and federal agency obligations during the period     November 15, 1995, through December 18, 1995. By unanimous vote, the     Committee ratified these transactions.By unanimous vote, the Committee authorized the renewal     until December 13, 1996, of the System\\'s regular reciprocal currency     (\"swap\") arrangement of $3 billion with the Bank of Mexico and the     System\\'s participation in the North American Framework Agreement     with the monetary authorities of Canada and Mexico. Both were due to     terminate on January 31, 1996. The additional temporary $3 billion     swap arrangement with the Bank of Mexico, approved by the Committee on     February 1, 1995, would lapse on January 31, 1996, in line with its     original terms.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and     financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the     intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial     information available at the time of the meeting and of the     Committee\\'s discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic     policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the     Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The information available at this meeting suggested that the     expansion of economic activity had slowed substantially after a strong     gain in such activity during the third quarter. Data on employment     and aggregate hours worked since late summer were consistent with     moderate further increases in overall economic activity. Industrial     production had changed little on balance after a sizable rise in the     third quarter. On the spending side, robust advances in business     fixed investment continued to provide considerable impetus to the     economy. The available information on consumer expenditures pointed     to somewhat reduced gains in recent months, and indicators of housing     demand suggested on balance that activity in housing markets had     tended to stabilize after several months of considerable     strengthening. Consumer prices had risen relatively slowly in recent     months, while increases in labor compensation had remained     comparatively subdued.Nonfarm payroll employment continued to grow at a pace     roughly in line with the expansion of the labor force in recent     months, with gains concentrated in the private service-producing     sectors. The published information indicated some further declines in     factory and government jobs in October and November. Although     aggregate hours of private production workers fell in November, they     remained appreciably above their average level in the third quarter.     The unemployment rate edged up to 5.6 percent in November, equaling     its average for the third quarter.Industrial production was little changed on balance over     October and November after a sizable increase in the third quarter. A     decline in October was largely accounted for by a strike at a major     aircraft manufacturer and that strike, very recently settled, had also     exerted a slightly depressing effect on production in November.     Production of motor vehicles and parts also fell, on net, in October     and November. Further growth outside the aircraft and motor vehicle     industries was paced by continuing strength in the production of     business equipment. Outside manufacturing, the output of utilities     was boosted in November by demand associated with unusually cold     weather.Business fixed investment was continuing to grow at a rapid     pace, with much of the strength stemming from the persisting and     vigorous expansion in spending for office and computing equipment.     However, the recent gains in total business investment had moderated     from the extraordinary pace evident in 1994 and early 1995, and they     also were less widespread among major categories of business equipment     than they had been earlier. New orders for nondefense capital goods     other than computers and aircraft had leveled out, although shipments     were being maintained at high levels by still-large backlogs of     unfilled orders. Producers of aircraft had received very sizable new     orders recently, but shipments of completed aircraft had been held     back in recent months by the strike at a major firm. Outlays for     nonresidential construction were continuing to advance briskly, with     construction of commercial structures posting sizable increases     recently. Overall drilling and mining activity also had continued to     move higher, led by increased exploration for natural gas.Total nominal retail sales rose considerably in November,     more than offsetting a drop in October; over the two months, retail     sales were advancing at a slower pace than the average rate in the     second and third quarters. Much of the November increase reflected     strong gains in sales of consumer durables, including improved sales     of motor vehicles. In the nondurables sector, a sizable rise in     November about reversed a decline in October. Recent surveys of     consumer sentiment pointed to generally positive attitudes.After having recorded robust advances during the third     quarter, most indicators of housing activity suggested little further     change more recently. However, considerable strength in mortgage     applications associated with lower mortgage rates, together with     survey indications of an upturn in house-buying intentions, pointed to     strengthening housing construction over coming months. Housing starts     were down in October, the latest month for which these data were     available, after a large increase in the third quarter.Data for October indicated a sizable accumulation of business     inventories. In manufacturing, stocks grew at a rate only moderately     below the brisk pace in the third quarter, and the rise continued to     be concentrated in the capital goods industries. The aggregate ratio     of inventories to sales in manufacturing was somewhat above the lows     in late 1994 and early 1995. In the wholesale sector, a buildup in     stocks of capital equipment accounted for the bulk of the accumulation     in October, and the inventory-to-sales ratio in this sector remained     on an uptrend. A sharp rise in retail inventories in October was led     by a large increase in stocks at auto dealers and at general     merchandise and apparel outlets. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the     retail sector as a whole was at its high for the year, but signs of     overstocking, apart from motor vehicles, were limited.After having strengthened appreciably in the third quarter,     federal government purchases were now lagging and exerting some     retarding effect on overall economic activity. The decline in federal     purchases in part represented the transitory effects of government     shutdowns and the restraining effects of spending cuts imposed by     continuing resolutions and by curtailed appropriations in bills that     already had been enacted into law. At the state and local government     levels, however, available data pointed to continued, relatively     strong growth in purchases.The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services     changed little in September (latest data available). Measured on a     quarterly average basis, however, the deficit declined substantially     in the third quarter, with the reduction about equally divided between     a rise in the value of exports and a drop in the value of imports.     Increases in exports were widespread among the major categories of     trade, while reductions in imports were concentrated in categories in     which there had been large gains in the second quarter. Available     data pointed to subdued growth in most of the major foreign industrial     countries in the second half of 1995.Consumer prices had risen more slowly on balance in recent     months than they had during the first half of the year. In November,     the total index for consumer prices was unchanged, and consumer prices     excluding food and energy were up only slightly. In contrast,     producer prices of finished goods registered a relatively large     increase in November, and the component of this index excluding food     and energy posted its largest rise since January. At the same time,     prices of intermediate materials declined a bit further in November.     According to recent survey results, consumers now expected less     inflation over the year ahead and also over the next five to ten     years. The available data on wages and worker benefits continued on     balance to display a relatively subdued trend of increases in labor     compensation.At its meeting on November 15, 1995, the Committee adopted a     directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure     on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the     likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting     period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee\\'s     long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic     growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and     monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly     lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting     period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were     expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over     coming months.Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the     existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the     intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged a bit above the     expected rate of 5-3/4 percent over the period. The bunching of     settlements of several Treasury issues that had resulted from debt     ceiling disruptions and the mid-December corporate tax date were among     the factors exerting pressure on the funds rate. Most other short-term interest rates fell slightly and longer-term interest rates     extended earlier declines during the intermeeting period. Market     expectations of some easing of monetary policy appeared to be     reinforced by market interpretations of the incoming information as     further evidence that overall demand would be restrained and that the     risks of a pickup in inflationary pressures had diminished. Over the     intermeeting interval, major indexes of stock prices continued to move     higher in concert with the rise in bond prices.The sluggish performance of the broad monetary aggregates     since August continued in November. Despite the persistence of low     opportunity costs associated with holding M2 assets, M2 growth was     relatively modest in November after a slight contraction in October.     M3 growth slowed further in November, partly as a result of a shift of     funding by borrowers toward capital market instruments to take     advantage of lower long-term market rates. Nonetheless, because of     robust expansion earlier in the year, M2 remained in the upper half of     its 1995 range through November and M3 expanded at a rate at the upper     end of its range. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had     slowed somewhat in recent months, reflecting reduced expansion of both     private and federal borrowing, and for 1995 to date, this debt measure     had grown at a rate around the midpoint of its monitoring range.In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the     dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose slightly further on     balance over the intermeeting period. Declining interest rates in     several major foreign industrial countries, evidently induced by     disappointing economic growth in those countries, appeared to have a     firming effect on the dollar in relation to European currencies. The     dollar changed little against the Japanese yen over the period after a     sharp advance earlier. The Mexican peso appreciated a bit in relation     to the dollar over the period.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that     the growth of economic activity would slow substantially from the very     strong pace now indicated for the third quarter. Although this     forecast did not differ significantly from that prepared for the     November meeting, less growth than expected earlier seemed likely in     the current quarter. Over the forecast horizon, however, the economy     was still projected to expand at a pace that would keep activity close     to the economy\\'s potential. The forecast anticipated that the     expansion in consumer spending would slow a bit in response to     diminished gains in disposable income associated with less-rapid     advances in spending in other sectors of the economy. The rise that     had occurred in the value of financial assets held by households would     be a positive factor helping to support consumer spending but one that     would be offset to a degree by the difficulties of an increasing     number of households in servicing their growing debts. The greater     affordability of housing stemming from the earlier decline in mortgage     rates was projected to help sustain homebuilding activity at a     relatively high level. In the context of reduced growth in sales and     profits, business investment in new equipment and structures was     projected to increase more moderately after several years of rapid     advance. Although indications of excess inventories were limited,     slower growth in sales and ongoing efforts to reduce inventory costs     were projected to lead to smaller increases in stocks over the     projection period. Exports were expected to be bolstered to some     extent by the projected improvement in the economies of major trading     partners. Although a great deal of uncertainty still surrounded the     fiscal outlook, the forecast continued to incorporate an appreciable     degree of fiscal restraint. Given the projected outlook, rates of     utilization of labor and capital resources would remain relatively     high, and the underlying trend of price inflation was seen as unlikely     to change significantly over the projection period.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective     developments, members noted that the information that had become     available since the November meeting tended to confirm earlier     indications that the economic expansion had slowed appreciably from     the brisk pace of the summer months. The members generally agreed     that the most likely course for the economy remained one of moderate     growth. Expansion at or near potential was seen as the most probable     outcome, associated at least in part with the favorable effects on     business and consumer spending of lower interest rates, higher equity     prices, and an ample availability of credit. However, a number of     members expressed concern that the strength of final demands would not     be sufficient to support growth near the economy\\'s potential, absent a     policy adjustment. One factor that might retard growth was a higher     level of real short-term interest rates owing to the favorable     performance of inflation. Members noted that consumer price increases     had remained relatively subdued and below expectations in recent     months, despite the generally high levels of utilization of both labor     and capital resources that had prevailed through much of the year.     Several commented that the effects of new technologies, gains in     productivity, global competitive pressures on businesses, and     restraint in wage setting might imply that inflation would edge down     further. Others expressed concern that the prospects for further     reductions in inflation seemed quite limited in the context of     projected high levels of resource use, including tight labor markets     in many parts of the country.In the Committee\\'s discussion of regional developments,     members reported that anecdotal and other information pertaining to     regional activity suggested that the moderation in nationwide economic     growth was evident across most of the nation, with the rate of     expansion ranging from slow to moderate in different areas of the     country. Overall levels of business activity continued to vary     widely, from relatively weak in some areas to comparatively robust in     others. Conditions also were uneven across industries, particularly     in manufacturing, where flagging auto sales and some further inventory     accumulation contrasted sharply with brisk demand for a range of     producers durable goods, notably office and computing equipment, and     building products. Despite indications that job growth had been     relatively limited, labor markets remained tight in many parts of the     country and there were more, albeit still limited, reports of rising     wage pressures; in some areas, however, labor market conditions     appeared to have eased somewhat recently.In their discussion of developments in key sectors of the     economy, members commented that the data and the anecdotal information     on consumer spending had been mixed. For the holiday season, reports     indicated that retail sales had been disappointing thus far, though     sales appeared to be holding up relatively well in some sections of     the country and for higher-priced luxury items more generally.     Consumers had remained very cautious despite considerable promotional     sales activity, perhaps anticipating even more aggressive markdowns of     prices as the shopping season neared its end. Members noted that the     reluctance of consumers also might be reflecting a sense of continued     job insecurity in an environment of ongoing business restructuring and     downsizing, higher debt service burdens and rising delinquency rates,     and the satisfaction of pent-up demand for durable goods. While these     factors might be exerting an inhibiting influence on consumers, the     members generally viewed moderate growth in consumer spending as a     reasonable expectation in the context of further projected expansion     in disposable incomes. The increase in household wealth associated     with the strong performance of the bond and stock markets might tend     to boost consumer spending relative to disposable incomes, although     one member suggested that the highly concentrated nature of wealth     holdings might limit any positive effect on aggregate consumption.     With regard to housing, members took note of the recent declines in     single-family housing starts and sales after a strong third quarter.     They remarked, however, that some of their contacts were anticipating     that the declines in mortgage interest rates over recent months to     their current relatively low levels would foster a wave of mortgage     refinancing and a pickup in housing demand in the spring.Business fixed investment was expected to grow at a pace     appreciably less than that observed in recent years but nonetheless to     continue supplying considerable impetus to the expansion. Strong     profits and cash flows, along with the ample availability of financing     on attractive terms, were favorable factors in the outlook; on the     other hand, a weakening trend in final demand, notably in consumer     outlays, likely would have a negative effect on business capital     spending. Several members reported that commercial and other     nonresidential construction activity remained brisk in various regions     around the nation. A number of members commented on business     inventory developments. Overall inventories of motor vehicles were on     the high side, and inventory accumulation more generally appeared to     be running somewhat ahead of sales. There were no indications that     serious overhangs were emerging, but there were risks that efforts to     hold down stocks would damp production over the near term.The outlook for fiscal policy continued to be clouded by the     uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the debate between the Congress     and the Administration. The members anticipated that the result of     the debate would be considerable fiscal restraint, but the timing of     tax and spending initiatives aimed at an eventual balancing of the     budget and the extent of the fiscal contraction over time could not be     forecast with any precision. In the interim, much of the federal     government was closed, and while federal workers were expected to     get paid eventually, their spending and that of federal contractors     might be damped until the situation was resolved. The members     believed, however, that in light of the plans being put forward, the     fiscal drag imposed by likely federal budget developments would not be     unusually large over the next few years.In reviewing the outlook for inflation, members referred to     the generally favorable price and cost experience of recent months.     Several pointed to subdued increases in labor compensation and to     anecdotal indications that upward pressures on wages and benefits     remained scattered despite tightness in many labor markets. In this     environment, and with the economy expected to expand at a     comparatively moderate pace over the forecast period, many members     anticipated that inflation would remain relatively stable despite     continuing high levels of resource utilization, and some believed that     it might record a somewhat improved performance. One argument     advanced in support of a possibly better performance was that the     recent experience, which had been more favorable than expected given     capacity utilization levels, was perhaps suggestive of the effects of     rapid technological improvements on productivity, the enhanced     efficiencies from greater economic specialization around the world,     and the influence of heightened job insecurity on wages and prices.     Another was the possible effect on future wage demands of the lower     inflation expectations that now prevailed. Although no member saw     greater inflation as having a high probability, several did refer to     risks in that direction, including the possibility of greater     pressures on resources stemming from faster than currently anticipated     economic growth.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting     period ahead, all the members either favored or could accept a slight     easing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions. One argument     cited in favor of some easing was that the policy stance, as indexed     by the prevailing real federal funds rate, was becoming somewhat     restrictive as inflation and inflationary expectations moderated,     leaving real short-term rates higher than anticipated. In addition,     with markets expecting a reduction in the federal funds rate in coming     months, an unchanged policy was likely to lead to a backup in     intermediate- and long-term rates. Although there was no sign that a     cumulative deterioration in economic performance was about to get     under way, the downside risks to the expansion appeared to have     increased and a modest easing would better position policy to guard     against the possibility that over the longer term the expansion would     begin to fall short of the economy\\'s potential, especially with fiscal     policy likely to be at least moderately restrictive. In any case, the     recent slowing of the economic expansion, combined with the wage and     price restraint evident at current levels of resource utilization and     continuing business efforts to expand capacity, suggested that there     was little risk of a pickup in inflation. Indeed, the favorable     inflation experience over the last half year raised the possibility of     continued modest price improvement.A number of members, though willing to accept a slight     easing, preferred an unchanged policy stance. While inflation had     slowed from the elevated pace observed in the early part of the year,     there was little hard evidence to indicate that it would decline any     further over the forecast horizon or that there had been a significant     increase in the sustainable growth rate of the economy. A few members     also expressed concern about the possible repercussions in financial     markets of an easing action that would follow an already strong rally     in bond and stock prices. In the circumstances, these members     questioned whether a somewhat easier policy stance would prove     consistent with the Committee\\'s objective of fostering further     progress toward price stability. Moreover, although the available     evidence on the economy\\'s current performance remained mixed, the     moderation in economic growth after the third-quarter surge did not     seem at this time to signal a growing shortfall of the economy from     its potential. Instead, the economy was likely in this view to     continue to grow at a generally acceptable rate at or near capacity,     and a few members saw some potential for somewhat faster growth at a     pace that over time could intensify inflationary pressures.     Accordingly, they preferred to wait for further evidence on inflation     trends and the performance of the economy, but they indicated that in     light of the uncertainties that were involved and the small amount of     easing that was proposed they would not dissent from the majority     position.With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the     intermeeting period, all the members endorsed a proposal to retain an     intermeeting instruction in the directive that did not incorporate any     presumption about the direction of a possible intermeeting change.     While such a change in policy could not be ruled out, the potential     need for a further intermeeting policy adjustment appeared remote at     this juncture. The risks to the outlook seemed generally in balance,     and the direction of the next policy move was not clear in the view of     some members.At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all the     members indicated that they favored or could support a directive that     called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve     conditions during the intermeeting period but that contained no     presumption about the likely direction of any intermeeting policy     change. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee\\'s long-run     objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and     giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary     developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly     lesser monetary restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting     period. A staff analysis indicated that the reserve conditions     contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth     of M2 and M3 over coming months.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and     directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute     transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following     domestic policy directive:The information reviewed at this meeting suggests       a substantial slowing in the expansion of economic       activity after a strong gain in the third quarter.       Nonfarm payroll employment increased further in       November, but the civilian unemployment rate edged up       to 5.6 percent. Industrial production was little       changed on average over October and November after a       moderate rise in the third quarter. Total nominal       retail sales rose somewhat on balance over October and       November. Housing starts were down in October after a       large increase in the third quarter. However, orders       for nondefense capital goods point to substantial       expansion of spending on business equipment in the near       term, and nonresidential construction has risen       appreciably further. Wage trends have been stable and       consumer prices have risen relatively slowly on average       in recent months.Most market interest rates have declined slightly       since the Committee meeting on November 15. In foreign       exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the       dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has risen       slightly on balance over the intermeeting period.The substantial moderation in the growth of M2 and       M3 since midsummer continued in November; however, for       the year through November, M2 expanded at a rate in the       upper half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate       at the upper end of its range. Growth in total       domestic nonfinancial debt has slowed somewhat in       recent months but for the year to date remains around       the midpoint of its monitoring range.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary       and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In       furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its       meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established       on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5       percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to       the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also       retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the       year that it had set for growth of total domestic       nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range       for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to       take account of changing intermediation patterns. For       1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis       the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary       aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter       of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of       the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated       in the light of progress toward price level stability,       movements in their velocities, and developments in the       economy and financial markets.In the implementation of policy for the immediate       future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the       existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In       the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for       price stability and sustainable economic growth, and       giving careful consideration to economic, financial,       and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve       restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be       acceptable in the intermeeting period. The       contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be       consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over       coming months.Votes for this action: Messrs.

Attended portion of meeting relating to the discussion of economic developments. Return to text2. Attended portion of meeting relating to a special agenda discussion of inflation. Return to textBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on May 7, 2002, were approved.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.The Manager also reported on recent developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period May 7, 2002, through June 24, 2002.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee voted unanimously to update its longstanding authorization for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to enter into agreements that would enable another Federal Reserve Bank to conduct System open market operations on a temporary basis in an emergency after designation by the Committee or the Chairman. The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity continued to expand in recent months, though at a slower pace than earlier in the year. Consumer purchases, residential housing outlays, and government spending recorded smaller gains, but business investment in durable equipment and software appeared to be leveling out after a long decline. Industrial production continued to pick up. Employment had risen a little, but not enough to lower the unemployment rate, and labor productivity seemed to be trending sharply upward. The surge in energy prices this year had boosted headline inflation, but core measures of inflation had trended lower.Private nonfarm payroll employment edged up in April and May after a slowdown in the first quarter in the pace of layoffs and job separations. Hiring was relatively brisk in the services sector in the April-May period, with most of the advances occurring in the temporary-help industry. Manufacturing payrolls recorded small declines in both months, while the number of jobs in construction steadied in May after a large drop in April. The civilian unemployment rate moved down somewhat, to 5.8 percent in May, but the average rate for the April-May period remained above the level in the two previous quarters.Industrial production rose for a fifth straight month in May. In manufacturing, output  increases in April and May continued to be spread widely across market groups and industries. The high-tech sector, notably computers and semiconductors, and the motor vehicles and parts sector remained strong, while the telecommunications and aircraft industries weakened further. Capacity utilization in manufacturing in May was a little above its depressed level at year-end, but substantially below its long-run average.Growth of consumer spending slowed appreciably in April and May from the brisk pace of the first quarter. Retail sales slumped in May after a sizable rise in April, largely reflecting weaker spending at apparel stores and general merchandise outlets and an apparent pause in purchases of light motor vehicles after an April surge. Real outlays on services in April (latest data) were unchanged.Residential housing activity remained elevated during April and May. Housing starts jumped in May after a small decline in April. The strength in starts over the two months evidently reflected the persistence of very positive homebuying attitudes arising at least in part from low mortgage rates. In May, sales of new single-family homes established a new record high, and sales of existing single-family homes were only slightly below the peak reached in the first quarter.The decline in business outlays for durable equipment and software had moderated further in the first quarter, and the available information suggested that spending on equipment and software was turning upward in the second quarter. Shipments of nondefense capital goods other than aircraft rose in April and May; shipments of computers and peripherals remained strong, shipments of communications equipment were still weak, and shipments of other durable goods continued to advance. In the nonresidential construction sector, outlays for office and industrial structures, lodging facilities, and public utilities declined substantially. In addition, expenditures for drilling and mining continued to drop. By contrast, construction of retail space, warehouses, and institutional structures picked up.Liquidation of manufacturing and trade inventories continued in April at about the pace of the first quarter, and the aggregate inventory-sales ratio declined further. In manufacturing, the rate of liquidation slowed substantially, and the aggregate stock-shipments ratio for the sector was at a very low level. Wholesalers ran down their inventories in April at a somewhat faster rate than in the first quarter; the sector's inventory-sales ratio fell sharply further to a relatively low level. Retailers boosted their stocks slightly in April, with all of the increase occurring at automotive dealers. The sector's aggregate inventory-sales ratio edged up in April but remained relatively low.The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened somewhat in April from both the March and the first-quarter levels, as the value of imports increased significantly more than that of exports. The rise in imports from March to April reflected higher prices for imported oil along with greater demand for a wide range of goods. The monthly step-up in exports was also broadly spread across categories of goods. With regard to economic activity abroad, the available information indicated that, on balance, foreign economic output had rebounded in the first half of the year, though the pace of recovery was uneven across regions and countries. Australia, Canada, and emerging Asia had experienced strong growth; the euro area also was expanding, but at a slower rate; and Japan appeared to have experienced a limited upturn in its economy. In South America, Brazil's economy was expanding but its financial markets had come under considerable stress, and elsewhere on the continent economic activity was generally weak, particularly in Argentina and Venezuela.Both the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditure chain-linked index indicated that consumer price inflation was moderate during the April-May period. Moreover, both measures showed that core price inflation during the first five months of the year had been a bit lower than in 2001. At the producer level, prices for core finished goods changed little over April and May and decelerated on a year-over-year basis. Labor costs, as measured by the average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers, also decelerated.At its meeting on May 7, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the intended level of the federal funds rate at 1-3/4 percent, and it also retained a neutral balance of risks statement. The Committee's press statement, with its language indicating that the Committee remained uncertain about the extent and timing of the strengthening of final demand, was viewed by market participants as expressing less confidence in the strength of the recovery than had been expected, and yields on Treasury securities declined slightly in response. Subsequently, investors became more risk averse in reaction to a mixture of economic data releases, growing geopolitical tensions, further warnings about terrorism, and additional revelations regarding questionable corporate accounting practices. Yields on Treasury securities dropped somewhat on net over the period, rates on lower-quality bonds rose, and equity prices fell sharply further. The federal funds rate remained close to the Committee's target level of 1-3/4 percent during the intermeeting period.In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the major foreign currencies dropped somewhat over the intermeeting period. The dollar's decline against the major foreign currencies occurred as questions about the strength of U.S. economic recovery and corporate earnings and the related lowering of expectations for near-term monetary tightening led to concerns that net foreign capital inflows might not be consistent with a stable exchange value for the dollar in the context of growing U.S. net international indebtedness. By contrast, the dollar rose slightly on average in terms of an index of the currencies of other important trading partners, notably the currencies of several Latin American countries that were experiencing political and economic problems.Growth of the broad monetary aggregates picked up in May owing to the unwinding of distortions from final tax payments and, apparently, to falling equity prices. The heightened volatility of equity markets may have enhanced the attractiveness of safe and liquid M2 assets, including liquid deposits and retail money market funds.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would pick up in the last half of the year from the sluggish pace of the second quarter and reach a relatively brisk pace next year. The considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place and the continuing sizable gains in productivity would provide significant impetus for spending, though weakness in equity prices would tend to offset some of that support. With  business capital stocks moving closer to desired levels, investment spending would be boosted by a gradually improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software. A more robust contour for final sales over the forecast horizon would lead to somewhat greater pressure on resource margins, despite the expected strong growth of structural productivity, though the level of activity would remain below the economy's potential for some time. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that there had been little change since the May meeting in the factors bearing on what they viewed as a favorable outlook for a pickup in the expansion. Although financial markets, and perhaps business and household confidence, had been shaken by revelations of accounting irregularities, the economy had continued to expand and the prospects for accelerating aggregate demand remained positive. Some members observed, however, that they had expected to see firmer indications of a strengthening recovery by the time of this meeting. The degree of impetus from decelerating inventory liquidation and growth in final demand had moderated during the spring, and anecdotal and other evidence indicated that the performance of various industries and firms had remained uneven. Looking ahead, the timing and strength of an upturn in the expansion remained subject to considerable uncertainty, but in the absence of major further adverse shocks to confidence the members anticipated that economic activity would accelerate over coming months to a pace in the vicinity of, and perhaps somewhat above, the rate of growth of the economy's potential. In support of this view, members cited the accommodative stance of both fiscal and monetary policy and the continuation of impressive growth in productivity that should buttress household incomes and spending and encourage a pickup in business investment. The strength in productivity also would help to hold down cost and price pressures and, given an economic expansion and resource utilization in line with the members' forecasts, would reinforce the prospect that core price inflation would remain low.In preparation for the mid-year monetary policy report to Congress, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 2002 and 2003. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP had central tendencies of 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent for 2002, implying growth in the second half of the year at a rate close to that currently estimated for the first half, and 3-1/2 to 4 percent for 2003. These rates of growth were expected to keep the civilian rate of unemployment in a central tendency of 5-3/4 to 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002 before it fell to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent by the fourth quarter of 2003. Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the chain-type price index for personal consumption expenditures, pointed to little change from recent inflation levels and were centered on a range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent for both this year and 2003.With imbalances in inventories apparently largely worked off and the contribution of inventory investment to the expansion likely diminishing in coming quarters, final demand would play its usual primary role in determining the strength of the expansion. In that regard, consumer spending was seen as likely to provide some continuing, though moderate, impetus to the growth of the economy. A favorable factor in this outlook cited by members was the ability and willingness of households to extract sizable financing resources for consumer and other expenditures by drawing on the appreciated equity in their homes in one form or another. The ample availability of credit to most consumers was another positive factor. Although consumer confidence as measured by national surveys recently had declined somewhat from relatively elevated levels, reports of strength in motor vehicle sales and in other retail sales in several parts of the nation in recent weeks suggested that consumer spending was continuing to be well maintained. The members recognized that a typical recovery-period surge in consumer spending was unlikely inasmuch as expenditures had registered solid growth through the economic downturn, implying an absence of significant pent-up demands.  Moreover, forecasts of even moderate growth in spending were subject to downside risks emanating, for example, from possible further shocks to confidence and household wealth should weakness in stock prices persist, and from political turmoil overseas and threats of terrorism at home.Homebuilding, though down after an unsustainable surge earlier in the year, had been well maintained in recent months. Recent statistics supported by widespread anecdotal reports pointed to persisting strength in housing activity, though there were indications of softness in high-priced homes in at least some parts of the country. Looking forward, members expected a high level of home construction to continue. A key factor in this outlook was the ready availability of mortgage financing to most borrowers at very attractive rates. Members also referred to growing population pressures, abetted by sizable immigration, on increasingly scarce buildable land in numerous areas. On balance, however, given its already robust level, housing was not seen as likely to provide much added stimulus to the expansion.   A pickup in business spending was viewed as a key to sustained solid growth, and questions about the timing and strength of such a pickup was a major source of uncertainty about the pace of the expansion in coming quarters. The preconditions for a robust advance in investment spending appeared to be largely in place, including the evident progress over the past several quarters in adjusting capital stocks to desired levels, the temporary tax incentive, and the need for competitive reasons to take advantage of the availability of increasingly productive equipment. In fact, recent orders and shipments data suggested an upturn in spending for new equipment, but the improvement was still quite limited, unevenly distributed across industries, and not yet firmly indicative of a sustained advance. While the members expected further gains in spending on equipment, they continued to report widespread pessimism among their business contacts, though exceptions had begun to emerge, and the persistence of a high degree of caution that was leading business executives to defer numerous investment projects until they saw more conclusive evidence of stronger sales and profits. The outlook for nonresidential construction activity remained bleak amid indications of a widespread overhang of available space and attendant declines in rents and property values. Indeed, the drop in such construction did not appear to have run its course for the nation as a whole. Even so, the ongoing adjustment of nonresidential capacity to demand had been substantial in recent quarters and likely would give way to a modest recovery during the year ahead.For the economy as a whole, the liquidation of business inventories appeared to be near completion in the current quarter, and some rebuilding in association with forecasts of moderate expansion in sales seemed a likely prospect for coming quarters. The restocking was expected to proceed gradually, given the probable persistence of a relatively high degree of uncertainty and caution in the business community. Such an outlook implied that inventory investment would supply positive but limited impetus to the expansion over the forecast horizon.The federal tax cuts and large increases in federal spending legislated over the past year were expected to provide support for aggregate demand over the projection period. Some members expressed concern, however, about what they perceived to be the erosion of long-term fiscal discipline and increasing prospects that federal deficits would persist even after the economy recovered, with adverse effects on the domestic savings available for investment. Concurrently, however, at the state and local government level where budget flexibility was more limited, sizable budgetary shortfalls likely would hold down expenditures and induce some tax increases, with restraining effects over a period of time.With regard to the outlook for the external sector of the economy, the sizable decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar since the start of the year had given rise to market forecasts of appreciable further depreciation. The factors that governed the exchange value of the dollar were complex, and historically forecasts of trends in exchange rates had not been reliable. To the extent that the depreciation of the dollar was not reversed or that it continued, it would of course tend to boost net exports. Exports would in any event be likely to strengthen somewhat as a consequence of the evidently improving economies of a number of the nation's important trading partners. Indeed, members provided anecdotal reports of better export markets for a number of U.S. products. At the same time, however, severe problems being experienced by a number of large countries in South America raised the specter of a deepening financial crisis within that region and the possibility of more widespread contagion.Given their anticipation of strong productivity growth and continuing slack in labor and other markets, members expected inflation to remain low over the next several quarters. An underlying factor in the good inflation performance of recent years and its extension into the future was the continuing absence of pricing power throughout the economy, evidently related in part to increased price competition in markets around the world stemming from globalization. Members cited examples of rising prices for a few products, notably steel, and the possibility that energy prices might raise costs.  They also referred to the potential for upward pressure on prices associated with the recent depreciation of the dollar. Nonetheless, with rising productivity and moderate wage gains likely continuing to help hold down unit labor costs, the outlook for subdued inflation remained promising, especially for the nearer term.The discussion of the inflation outlook was held against the backdrop of an earlier consideration at this meeting of the factors behind the decline in inflation in the 1990s and the value of structural models for forecasting inflation. Most Committee members, while acknowledging the deficiencies of structural models, viewed them as useful in their efforts to understand how the inflation process was changing and also as input to inflation forecasts. The members saw greater productivity growth, changing labor markets, and increased competition in product markets as having played a part along with monetary policy in lowering inflation. They agreed that more research--across countries as well as across time--was needed before they could become more confident about the value and stability of such models.     In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members agreed that recent developments argued for maintaining an unchanged policy stance, with the target for the federal funds rate remaining at 1-3/4 percent. The members saw favorable prospects for a significant acceleration in the expansion from the reduced pace in the current quarter, but considerable uncertainty still surrounded the timing and strength of the pickup. In the current situation, retention of the currently accommodative policy stance was desirable to counter the lingering effects of financial and other shocks to the economy that were continuing to exert a depressing impact on output and resource use. Inflation was still edging down, inflation expectations appeared to be low and stable, and going forward the members' forecasts for growth and productivity implied that unit costs and prices would remain subdued for some time.A number of members noted that the current policy stance was too accommodative to be consistent over time with the Committee's objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.  Economic performance in line with their current forecasts would at some point require an adjustment to policy toward a less accommodative stance once more definitive indications of sustained strengthening started to emerge. And given the lags in monetary policy such an adjustment would probably need to be made at a time when the incoming economic information was still somewhat mixed. Still, in current circumstances, there was little risk of triggering an increase in inflation by waiting for a better reading on the course of the economy. Some members were concerned that markets might not fully appreciate the inevitability of eventual policy tightening. However, others pointed out that market participants seemed to have little doubt about the Committee's determination to keep inflation low and in that context markets were likely to anticipate Committee action once incoming information suggested it was becoming appropriate.The members said that they could see risks on both sides of their forecasts, which indicated that growth would pick up and inflation would remain low over coming quarters at the current stance of policy. Accordingly, they agreed to retain an assessment of balanced risks to their long-term objectives in the Committee's post-meeting press release. Such a statement would not be an impediment to adjusting policy should a significant and unanticipated change in economic conditions materialize in the near term.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1-3/4 percent.The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are balanced with respect to prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Gramlich, Jordan, McTeer, Olson, Santomero, and Stern.  Votes against this action: None.

Rudebusch and Tootell, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Dallas, Atlanta, New York, San Francisco, and Boston respectively  By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on June 25-26, 2002, were approved.By unanimous vote, Vincent R. Reinhart was elected as Secretary and Economist of the Committee for the period until the first regularly scheduled meeting in 2003.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period June 26, 2002, through August 12, 2002.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity expanded only slightly in the second quarter. Businesses added a bit to their inventory positions after an extended period of sizable declines, but final sales changed little: business capital spending weakened somewhat further while growth in consumer spending, residential housing expenditures, and government outlays slowed. The scant information available for the third quarter, principally July's very strong motor vehicle sales, suggested that domestic demand was still recovering but relatively sluggishly. Industrial production had continued to advance since the first quarter, but the demand for labor services had increased only slightly and the unemployment rate had risen. Importantly, labor productivity continued on a strong upward trend. Overall price inflation had fallen sharply over the past year, largely reflecting developments in the food and energy sectors, and core inflation had eased a little.Private nonfarm payroll employment inched up in July after a mild increase in June, though aggregate hours worked by production or nonsupervisory workers declined steeply. The help-supply portion of the services sector and the construction industry recorded substantial net job losses over the June-July period, but manufacturing registered its smallest payroll decline in two years in July, and hiring was relatively brisk in services other than help-supply. The civilian unemployment rate edged up in June, to 5.9 percent, and was unchanged in July.Industrial production jumped in June, and gains in output were widespread across market groups and industries. However, the limited available information indicated that output leveled out in July after six consecutive months of increases. Capacity utilization in manufacturing moved a little higher in June but remained substantially below its long-run average.Retail sales were relatively brisk in June and July despite plunging equity prices and an apparently marked erosion in consumer confidence. Households spent heavily on motor vehicles in response to incentives offered by auto manufacturers, and their expenditures on other retail categories were generally well maintained.Residential housing activity remained strong in the second quarter, buoyed by a very favorable mortgage financing environment. The pace of homebuilding in the quarter continued well above that seen during the past few years even though single-family housing starts in June did not reach the elevated May level. Sales of new single-family homes in June remained at a record high, but sales of existing homes declined noticeably. In the multifamily sector, June starts were in the lower end of their range over recent quarters. Market conditions in the condominium and cooperative apartment portion of the housing sector appeared to be favorable, but rising vacancy rates and weaker rents apparently hindered the rental apartment segment.Business investment in equipment and structures declined further in the second quarter as the continuing downdraft in nonresidential construction more than offset a pickup in business spending for durable equipment and software. Despite gradually improving fundamentals--rising output and profits, new tax incentives, and a low cost of capital--firms remained cautious about stepping up their investments in equipment and software, and recent data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods coupled with anecdotal reports suggested further lackluster gains in spending in coming months. In the nonresidential construction sector, outlays for office, industrial, and other structures, lodging facilities, and public utilities declined substantially further. By contrast, construction of institutional structures was up again in the second quarter.Nonfarm inventory investment turned slightly positive in the second quarter after several quarters of heavy liquidation. Success in pruning inventories had resulted in inventory-sales ratios that generally were at very low levels across the manufacturing, wholesale, and retail sectors. There appeared to be only a few industries with still sizable inventory overhangs.The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened further in May and for the April-May period. The expansion of the deficit over the two months reflected a sharp rise in the value of imports that exceeded a sizable gain in the value of exports. The step-up in imports was spread widely across almost all the major trade categories, with notable increases in motor vehicles, consumer goods, and machinery. The advance in exports was primarily in automotive parts, industrial supplies, and capital equipment. With regard to economic activity abroad, the available information, which is released in many cases only with a considerable lag, indicated that foreign economic output generally continued to rebound during the first half of the year, though the pace of recovery was uneven across regions and countries. Growth was strong in Canada, the United Kingdom, and emerging Asia, but expansion in the euro area and Japan remained sluggish, owing to continued weakness in final domestic demand. In South America, economic and financial conditions had deteriorated significantly during the intermeeting period, especially in Brazil and Uruguay, and economic activity remained particularly weak in Argentina and Venezuela.Consumer price inflation trended down over the past year. Much of the drop reflected developments in the food and energy sectors, but core inflation also eased a little. In May and June, both the consumer price and the chain-weighted personal consumption indexes exhibited little change in total and core prices. Moreover, at the producer level, inflation in core finished goods was at a low rate in the May-June period and the past twelve months.  With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers increased at a somewhat faster rate during the three months ended in June, reflecting a surge in benefit costs. From a somewhat longer perspective, however, growth of compensation costs over the twelve months ended in June was the same as in the previous twelve-month period.At its meeting on June 25-26, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the intended level of the federal funds rate at 1-3/4 percent, and it also retained a neutral balance of risks statement. There was little market reaction to the Committee's rate decision or its statement. Instead, market participants focused their attention on further revelations of corporate malfeasance, fears that more earnings restatements would be announced in the run-up to the August 14 deadline for certifying corporate financial statements, and concerns that second-half corporate earnings might prove disappointing. In this environment, equity prices plunged before recovering somewhat later in the intermeeting period; on net, the major broad equity indexes were down substantially. Yields on Treasury securities also fell markedly on balance in volatile trading, as investors sought a safe haven for their funds and trimmed their expectations about the path for the intended federal funds rate in coming quarters. However, doubts about corporate balance sheets and the prospects for earnings growth led to steep increases in corporate debt yields, particularly for lower-quality issues.In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar changed little on balance in terms of the major foreign currencies over the intermeeting period, though early in the period the dollar declined sharply against those currencies amid further disclosures of U.S. corporate accounting irregularities and concerns about the strength of the U.S. recovery. Against the background of a similar combination of disappointing concerns, European stock prices dropped more than those in the United States, while Japanese equity prices declined less as incoming data seemed to point to a mild pickup of economic activity in Japan. Across all the major industrial economies, investors tended to shift funds toward less risky instruments and to lower their expectations for policy rates. The dollar also was little changed on balance against the index of currencies of other important trading partners, even though several South American countries were experiencing difficult financial and political problems.Borrowing by domestic nonfinancial businesses had been weak recently, likely reflecting deteriorating conditions in credit markets and reduced requirements for funds to finance capital spending projects. Growth of M2 surged in July in association with large inflows to liquid deposits and retail money market funds. The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, in light of weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, the expansion of economic activity would pick up gradually over the next year and a half from the very sluggish pace of the second quarter. The considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place and the continuing sizable gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus for spending, though the persisting volatility and weakness in equity prices would tend to offset some of that support. Inventory overhangs appeared to have been largely eliminated and business capital stocks to have moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a gradually improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to boost business investment spending. However, a less robust pickup in final sales was now expected over the forecast period, which would put somewhat less pressure on resource margins than had been anticipated previously, and the level of activity would remain below the economy's potential for a somewhat longer time. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.  In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that much of the incoming information on economic activity had been disappointing, and many indicated that they had marked down their growth forecasts for the months ahead. Even so, with recent weakness concentrated in volatile high-frequency data that might well prove to be transitory and with business and consumer confidence unlikely to deteriorate further in the absence of a major shock to the economy, members continued to place favorable odds on an underlying outlook of strengthening expansion. Factors cited for this positive outlook included the stimulative stances of fiscal and monetary policy, the apparent completion in most industries of efforts to bring inventories and capital facilities into desired alignment with expected sales, and the support to consumer incomes and business incentives provided by the continued rise in structural productivity. Further gains in productivity and the prospect for relatively contained demand pressures on resources, which were likely to be somewhat more limited for a time than members had anticipated earlier, would contribute to keeping price inflation subdued.A number of members commented on financial developments that appeared to be holding back the pace of the expansion. While prices in equity markets had turned up from their recent lows, the cumulative losses in financial wealth incurred since early 2000 clearly were having an adverse impact on expenditures by households and the higher cost of equity capital was inhibiting business investment. The declines in equity prices had been accompanied by a heightened degree of risk aversion that had led to widened credit spreads in financial markets and the curtailment of credit availability to potential borrowers whose repayment prospects were viewed as questionable.  To an extent that was difficult to determine, the current skittishness in debt and equity markets reflected lender and investor reactions to the ongoing revelations of corporate governance failures. Those reactions, which were proving to be more severe and probably would be longer-lasting than many had anticipated, appeared to be contributing to more cautious business spending and hiring, at least temporarily. It was unclear when the associated uncertainties would diminish and confidence would begin to rebuild, though the outlook might come into better focus after the mid-August SEC deadline for the certification of financial statements by corporate executives. On the positive side, home mortgage financing remained widely available at low interest rates and was providing important support to household spending. More generally, interest costs had declined for borrowers with acceptable credit ratings, and the overall condition of the banking system remained sound with bank credit widely available. Moreover, for many households, the negative wealth effects stemming from losses on equities were offset, at least to some extent, by continuing increases in home equity values. These ongoing factors suggested to some members that the effects of the financial restraints on economic activity might be fairly limited at this point.In their review of demand prospects in key sectors of the economy, members noted that household spending was continuing to play a key role in sustaining the expansion. Retail sales, buttressed by strength in motor vehicles, had been well maintained in recent months despite survey evidence of declining consumer confidence. The extraction of funds from increases in home equity evidently remained an important source of financing for household expenditures, especially including outlays for home modernization. Looking ahead, the anticipated pickup in employment and related gains in incomes, undergirded by continued robust growth in structural productivity, was seen as supporting further expansion in consumer spending. Some members commented, however, that the declines in equity wealth and the possible persistence of turmoil in equity markets might continue to restrain the pickup in consumer expenditures in the months ahead.In the housing sector, low mortgage interest rates remained a key factor in sustaining homebuilding activity at a relatively elevated level. Housing markets continued to exhibit strength across much of the country, with few indications of any moderation except for sales of high-priced homes.  It was noted that, in the absence of an unanticipated downturn in general economic activity, underlying pressures for housing as the population expanded coupled with the scarcity of viable homebuilding sites in urban areas likely would preclude any substantial decline in housing activity or housing prices in the foreseeable future.The weakness in business fixed investment was still a depressant on overall economic activity, though the decline in business outlays had abated since the latter part of 2001; indeed, spending for equipment and software had edged up in the second quarter. With excess stocks of capital inventories seemingly worked down to more acceptable levels in many industries and with expansion in final sales expected to become more firmly established, an acceleration in spending for equipment and software was likely in store. As they had at earlier meetings, however, members observed that business sentiment remained extraordinarily cautious on the whole and that business firms in most industries continued to direct their investment spending primarily toward enhancing the productivity of their operations rather than also increasing capacity. Exceptions cited by members included the enlargement of production facilities by some firms in industries that were currently enjoying vigorous demand, such as producers of motor vehicles. How soon the gloom surrounding the outlook for a pickup in sales and profits and the associated concerns in financial markets would dissipate was subject to substantial uncertainty, but increasing needs for capital as the economy continued to expand, further growth in investment opportunities in conjunction with the uptrend in structural productivity, and the temporary tax incentive provision for equipment and software likely would support a sustained recovery in investment expenditures over coming quarters that would provide essential impetus for lifting economic growth.The prospects for an upturn in nonresidential construction appeared to many to be more bleak. Reports from around the nation pointed to high, and in many areas still rising, vacancy rates for commercial and industrial space, and hotel construction continued to be held down by the problems afflicting the travel industry. Against this backdrop, overall nonresidential building activity seemed likely to decline further over the next several quarters.Business inventories edged up in the second quarter after declining persistently since early 2001. Indeed, the strengthening was sufficient to account for the small advance in GDP in the latest quarter. With inventories now apparently close to desired levels in many sectors of the economy and reportedly below such levels for some retailers, the expected strengthening in final sales would probably foster some inventory accumulation over coming quarters, thereby adding impetus to the projected growth of the economy.Government spending also was expected to provide ongoing stimulus to the expansion, especially given the prospects for further spending initiatives in forthcoming federal legislation. In addition, already enacted income tax cuts and the tax expensing provision for certain investment outlays would help to support both consumer and business expenditures. Concurrently, though, state and local governments facing large shortfalls in revenues in a sluggish economy were holding down the overall growth in their expenditures. Anecdotal reports suggested, however, that sizable spending on a variety of construction projects was continuing, financed in part through bond issues. On balance, the government sector was expected to remain a positive factor in the economic recovery.The depreciation of the dollar and overall strengthening in foreign economic activity were projected to foster moderate added growth in U.S. exports over the next several quarters. However, recent developments, including indications of weaker-than- projected economic recovery in Europe, growing questions about the outlook for several important economies in South America, and the continued sluggish performance of the Japanese economy, threatened to limit the improvement in exports, at least over the nearer term. Providing a partial counterweight were anecdotal reports indicating sizable growth in U.S. exports to a number of Asian countries.The outlook for inflation remained very favorable in the context of continuing slack in labor markets and robust growth in structural productivity. Under these conditions, increases in trend unit labor costs were likely to remain subdued over the next several quarters despite likely further escalation in the cost of worker healthcare benefits. Indeed, the risks of any significant run-up in inflation appeared to have receded, and more time than anticipated earlier was likely to elapse before the expansion reached a pace that would begin to reduce margins of underutilized labor and other producer resources. Even so, examples of rising cost and price pressures were not entirely absent. In addition to healthcare insurance costs, these pressures included insurance costs more generally, steel prices, some materials costs, and, in association with the dollar's depreciation, some upward pressures on import prices. On balance and barring a major supply shock to the economy, members saw little reason for concern about the prospect of an increase in inflation in the foreseeable future.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members were in favor of an unchanged policy stance consistent with retaining a target rate of 1-3/4 percent for the federal funds rate. Although some economic and financial indicators had deteriorated since the June meeting and the members generally had scaled down their economic forecasts, they continued to see favorable prospects for a strengthening economy over time.  To be sure, a further significant weakening in economic prospects--for example, that might be associated with additional deterioration in financial markets--might well call for a policy response, but for now the members viewed the current degree of monetary accommodation as appropriately calibrated to provide the stimulus needed to foster a solid expansion that would bring the economy to fuller resource utilization.     All the members indicated that they could accept, and most said they preferred, a proposal to shift the Committee's assessment of the risks to the economy from the currently neutral statement to one that was tilted toward weakness in the foreseeable future. A few expressed a preference to retain the current balanced risks statement for the press release to be issued shortly after this meeting. In support of this view, they underscored the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook for financial and economic conditions and the prospect that many observers in financial markets could misread a shift in the Committee's assessment of the risks to the outlook as a signal that the Committee was contemplating easing in the near term. All the members agreed, however, on the desirability of communicating in some form--whether in the text of the post-meeting press release or through a shift in the risks statement or both--their view that the expansion recently had been less robust than expected and that for the foreseeable future the risks of a more extended period of subpar growth had increased while those of inflation had declined.  Several also commented that while the shift under consideration might raise expectations of some easing in coming months, those expectations and related market adjustments would be shaped principally by the tenor of the incoming economic information.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1-3/4 percent.The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.Votes for this action: Messrs.

Coughlin, Elsasser, and Sullivan, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve         Banks of St. Louis, New York, and Chicago respectively  By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market         Committee held on August 13, 2002, were approved.       The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments         in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign         currencies for the System’s account in the period since the previous         meeting.        The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets         and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities         issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period August         13, 2002, through September 23, 2002. By unanimous vote, the Committee         ratified these transactions.        The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial         outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period         ahead.       The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that the economy         continued to expand in the third quarter, though the tenor of incoming         reports was mixed. Data on household and business spending had been solid         for the most part, and residential construction remained high. Motor vehicle         production provided a sizable boost to economic activity, but other factory         output changed little on net. Employment continued to expand unevenly,         while labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend. Overall price         inflation had fallen over the past year, reflecting favorable developments         in the food and energy sectors and a decline in core inflation.       Aggregate labor market conditions had been mixed in recent months. While         nonfarm payroll employment registered further small gains in July and         August, the aggregate hours worked by production or nonsupervisory workers         declined on balance over the two-month period. The manufacturing and retail         trade sectors registered sharp job losses in August, but those were more         than offset by hiring in the services and construction sectors. A hefty         increase in government jobs at the federal, state, and local levels also         boosted payroll employment. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.7         percent in August despite advances in claims for unemployment insurance.       Industrial production declined in August, largely offsetting July’s         rise. Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing output was unchanged in         both July and August after sizable advances in the first half of the year.         Production in the high-tech sector jumped in August, the manufacture of         aircraft and parts fell further, and output in the remainder of the industrial         sector was mixed. Capacity utilization in manufacturing changed little         in August and was substantially below its long-run average.       Retail sales remained relatively brisk in August despite further decreases         in stock prices and consumer confidence. Households boosted their already         high level of spending on motor vehicles in response to zero percent financing         and larger cash incentives offered by auto manufacturers, and household         purchases of goods other than motor vehicles continued to advance at a         moderate pace. According to the latest available data, outlays for services         rose moderately in July.       Residential housing activity slowed a little in July and August from         the robust pace of the second quarter as further declines in mortgage         rates apparently helped to support housing activity in an environment         of sluggish employment and diminishing household wealth. Starts of single-family         units fell in August to their lowest rate since last November, while starts         in the multifamily sector in the July-August period were at their average         rate for the first half of the year. Sales of new single-family homes         posted a record high in July, and the inventory of unsold new homes remained         low. Sales of existing single-family homes in July partially retraced         a large drop in June.       Based on the limited information available, business investment in equipment         and software seemed to be advancing at a solid pace in the third quarter.         This reflected an acceleration in spending that was associated importantly         with notably stronger motor vehicle sales and a halt to the contraction         in aircraft expenditures. Outside the transportation sector, outlays on         equipment continued to expand at a moderate pace; in addition, the level         of orders in July (latest data) moved above shipments for the first time         since early last year, and the backlog of unfilled orders edged up. Nonresidential         construction activity remained on a steep downtrend in July, with further         reductions of spending in all major categories except office buildings.        The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor         vehicles registered a second straight monthly gain in July after many         months of heavy liquidation. Despite the rise in stocks, gains in sales         and shipments drove inventory-sales ratios to even lower levels across         the manufacturing, wholesale, and retail sectors. Survey and anecdotal         information suggested that few industries were burdened with sizable inventory         overhangs.       The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed appreciably in         July after two quarters of large increases. The smaller deficit in July         reflected continued strong expansion of the value of exports coupled with         a decrease in the value of imports. The step-up in goods exports occurred         mostly in motor vehicles and aircraft, while the gain in exports of services         was spread across travel and other private services. The decline in imports         was concentrated in consumer and capital goods, royalties, and license         fees. The very limited available information on economic activity abroad         in the third quarter suggested continued sluggish expansion in the euro         area and Japan, moderate growth in the United Kingdom, further brisk recovery         in Canada, and ongoing recovery in emerging Asia. Conditions in South         America remained fragile: Economic activity was still very weak in Argentina         and Venezuela, and the Brazilian economy had been adversely affected by         the turbulence in financial markets, though those markets had stabilized         recently. By contrast, Mexico experienced brisk growth in the second quarter.       Despite a slight pickup in consumer price inflation in August, the increase         in consumer prices (measured by either the consumer price index or the         chain-indexed personal consumption expenditure index) for the year ending         in August was considerably smaller than that for the previous twelve-month         period. Much of the drop in inflation reflected developments in the food         and energy sectors, but core inflation also declined noticeably. Producer         prices for core finished goods likewise signaled a drop in inflation over         the last year. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of         production or nonsupervisory workers decelerated sharply over the twelve         months ended in August, reflecting the effects of both the rise in unemployment         and the drop in consumer price inflation.       At its meeting on August 13, 2002, the Committee retained a directive         that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with         keeping the intended level of the federal funds rate at 1-3/4 percent,         but it shifted from a statement of a neutral balance of risks to one that         was tilted toward economic weakness in the foreseeable future. Market         participants read the tilt and the wording of the announcement as indicating         that economic activity in the coming months likely would be weaker than         had been expected, and some short-term interest rates eased slightly while         broad indexes of equity prices moved lower. The following day’s         deadline for the recertification of corporate financial statements passed         uneventfully and equity markets rallied. Subsequently, however, a weaker         tone to incoming data on production and employment, a gloomier outlook         for business profits, and heightening tensions over Iraq seemed to lead         investors to revise down their outlook for the economy. Over the intermeeting         period, intermediate- and longer-term Treasury security yields and broad         equity indexes fell considerably on balance.       In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar         in terms of the major foreign currencies appreciated slightly on balance         over the intermeeting period as projections for growth of foreign industrial         countries, particularly Germany and Japan, were marked down more than         those for the United States. The dollar moved within narrow ranges against         most major currencies but rose somewhat against the yen and the currencies         of other important trading partners.       M2 growth remained elevated in August, though somewhat below July’s         rapid pace. Much of the strength of the aggregate’s liquid components         likely was associated with the continuing historically low opportunity         costs of holding such deposits, the recent surge in mortgage refinancing         activity, and the safe haven provided from volatile equity prices. Borrowing         by domestic nonfinancial businesses remained weak, likely reflecting reduced         requirements for funds to finance capital spending projects and perhaps         the improved tone in the corporate bond market and a modest increase in         the issuance of corporate debt.        The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, in light         of weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, the expansion of economic         activity would pick up more gradually but would still reach a relatively         brisk pace late next year. The considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus         already in place, continuing gains in structural productivity, and improving         business confidence would provide significant impetus for spending. Inventory         overhangs appeared to have been largely eliminated, and business capital         stocks appeared to have moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence,         a gradually improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs,         and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment         and software were expected to boost business investment spending. However,         a less robust pickup in final sales was now expected over the forecast         period, which would put somewhat less pressure on resource margins than         had been anticipated previously, and the level of activity would remain         below that of the economy’s potential for a longer time. The persistence         of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core         price inflation.       In the Committee’s discussion of current and prospective economic         conditions, members commented that economic growth appeared to have picked         up in the third quarter but that the most recent information had been         mixed, raising questions about whether the pace of the expansion going         forward would be strong enough to erode margins of underutilized labor         and capital resources. For now, a high degree of business caution in the         context of substantial uncertainties, exacerbated recently by apparently         increased concerns about the geopolitical outlook, continued to restrain         business investment and hiring. Even so, the economy appeared to be well         positioned for solid gains over time in light of the progress that had         been made in bringing inventories and capital stocks into better alignment         with sales, the stimulus provided by accommodative fiscal and monetary         policies, and the implications of the strong uptrend in productivity for         profitable investment opportunities and growth in consumer incomes. With         the growth of economic activity nonetheless expected to remain below the         economy’s potential for some time, pressures on labor and other         resources would be limited and in turn wage and price increases likely         would continue to edge lower.        In their review of developments in and prospects for key sectors of         the economy, members commented that household spending had continued to         be well maintained. Buttressed by exceptional strength in sales of motor         vehicles, consumer spending had displayed solid growth during the summer         months. While survey indicators of consumer confidence had declined this         year, the high levels of consumer spending on homes, motor vehicles, and         other big-ticket items were, in the view of at least some members, perhaps         a better gauge of consumer confidence. The value of homes had continued         to rise in most areas, and unusually low interest rates were inducing         people to refinance mortgages and in the process to extract and spend         some of the embedded equity gains. Increasing home equity values probably         were also providing some counterweight to the impact on consumer spending         of the negative wealth effects associated with the declines in stock market         prices since the spring of 2000. Other positive factors cited as helping         to undergird the persisting strength in consumer spending included reductions         in federal income tax rates; the availability of financing for consumer         durable goods at relatively attractive interest rates, including zero         interest rates for selected motor vehicles; and the cumulative effects         of productivity gains on current and expected real consumer incomes. Looking         ahead, sales of motor vehicles likely would moderate to some extent over         coming months from their currently unsustainable levels, and some members         referred to indications of slower growth in retail sales in late summer         and somewhat downbeat forecasts for coming months reported by a number         of retailer contacts. Moreover, the absence of significant growth in employment,         should it persist, could at some point have significant adverse repercussions         on consumer spending. On balance, consumer spending was seen as likely         to remain a positive but possibly a more limited source of support for         the expansion over the next several quarters.       In the context of sustained growth in incomes, low mortgage interest         rates, by facilitating the extraction of homeowners’ equity, had         played a key role in inducing a high level of spending on residential         structures and home improvement expenditures. Tending to confirm currently         available data on housing activity, members cited persisting anecdotal         reports of robust home sales and residential construction in many regions,         though indications of softening were noted in some areas and market segments,         particularly in the high-price sector of the housing market. Some members         questioned whether generally rising housing prices and elevated levels         of refinancings would persist. However, given the anticipated continuation         of accommodative conditions in mortgage markets and forecasts of rising         incomes, the overall outlook for housing remained favorable.       Business fixed investment remained a significant question mark in the         outlook for economic expansion. Recent readings on business spending for         equipment and software pointed to gradual improvement, but nonresidential         construction activity continued to be severely depressed in many areas.         It was unclear whether the recent strength in orders and shipments signaled         a significant acceleration in capital outlays, and in this regard the         new information that would become available in the next few weeks might         provide important evidence on the outlook for capital spending and thus         for the performance of the economy more generally. At least for now, however,         anecdotal reports suggested that a high degree of caution continued to         characterize business investment decisions in the face of an elevated         level of uncertainty. Much of the current spending for equipment and software         reportedly represented replacement demand largely associated with the         short useful lives of various types of equipment, and there appeared to         be little spending that would entail capital deepening. At the same time,         several positive factors in the outlook for capital spending could be         cited including the greater productivity of new capital equipment, the         temporary accelerated expensing tax incentives, generally strong business         cash positions, and the relatively rapid depreciation of existing capital         equipment. For the present, however, business contacts widely reported         that because of prevailing uncertainties they were deferring major investment         initiatives until they saw clear evidence of an increased need for capital         to meet growing demand.       Business firms appeared to be in the process of moving from inventory         liquidation to accumulation, and the available evidence suggested that         inventory positions were getting tighter. Accordingly, prospective growth         in final demand would have to be met through increased production. And         as demand rose over the next several quarters, businesses were expected         to accumulate inventories to maintain desired inventory-sales ratios,         adding in the process some limited impetus to the growth of GDP.       The growth of economic activity in most major foreign countries appeared         to be falling below expectations earlier in the year, with adverse implications         for U.S. exports. Among those nations, only Canada had experienced a robust         economic recovery thus far this year. Current forecasts continued to anticipate         strengthening activity abroad, but as in the case of the U.S. economy         substantial uncertainties surrounded the timing and pace of the improvement.       In the context of limited demand pressures on labor and other resources,         current forecasts continued to point to quite low and perhaps declining         inflation over the next several quarters, although there appeared to be         significant crosscurrents in the outlook for prices. Rapid increases in         healthcare and other insurance costs and the lagged passthrough of large         increases in oil prices would tend to maintain upward pressure on prices.         Tending to oppose those forces, though, were the effects on resource use         of an extended period of economic activity below the economy’s potential         as well as the effects of robust productivity gains on costs, apparently         declining inflation expectations, and the persistent absence of pricing         power in highly competitive markets. Indeed, the members did not rule         out the emergence of appreciably lower inflation. In this regard, some         observed that a significant decline in inflation from current levels could         imply an unwelcome tightening of monetary policy in real terms. In addition,         further sizable disinflation that resulted in a nominal inflation rate         near zero could create problems for the implementation of monetary policy         through conventional means in the event of an adverse shock to the economy         that called for negative real policy interest rates.       In the Committee’s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period         ahead, all but two of the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged         policy stance. In the view of all the members, current forecasts clearly         were subject to the risk that economic growth would not be sufficient         to reduce excess capacity in labor and capital markets. However, the members         who favored a steady policy course noted that the recent data on household         and business spending had been a bit stronger than expected and that a         number of factors pointed to solid growth over time. In these circumstances,         they believed that in the context of prevailing uncertainties more evidence         of subpar expansion was desirable before policy was eased further. It         was noted in this regard that the information that would become available         over the next several weeks should provide an improved basis for assessing         the recent anecdotal reports from around the nation that pointed to a         possibly slowing expansion. Several members indicated that if compelling         evidence of a weak economy were to materialize they would be prepared         to ease promptly. Two members preferred an immediate easing action because         they were persuaded by what they viewed as already strong evidence of         a persisting unsatisfactory, and perhaps weakening, economic performance.         While the current stance of policy was already accommodative, they felt         that greater stimulus was now called for to foster an acceptable pace         of economic expansion.       All the members agreed that the risks to the economy remained tilted         toward weakness and that such an assessment needed to be incorporated         in the statement to be released shortly after today’s meeting. The         members also accepted a proposal to add a reference in the statement regarding         what they viewed as recently heightened geopolitical risks that appeared         to constitute a major source of the uncertainty currently prevailing in         the economy. The addition was not intended to signal that any particular         policy response would be forthcoming in the event of a crisis. Rather,         consistent with its usual practice, the Committee would assess the implications         of any such development for the domestic economy before deciding on an         action. Indeed, if the geopolitical uncertainties were to ease significantly         along with what already were apparently diminishing concerns about corporate         governance issues, the resulting improvement in business and consumer         sentiment could generate a more robust economic expansion.        At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize         and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed         otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance         with the following domestic policy directive.                  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions           that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.           To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future           seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the           federal funds rate at an average of around 1-3/4 percent. The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in         the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable           economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee           believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions           that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.Votes for this action: Messrs.

Gramlich and McTeer dissented because they preferred to ease         monetary policy at this meeting. The economic expansion, which resumed         almost a year ago, had recently lost momentum, and job growth had been         minimal over the past year. With inflation already low and likely to decline         further in the face of economic slack and rapid productivity growth, the         potential cost of additional stimulus seemed low compared with the risk         of further weakness. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on         Wednesday, November 6, 2002.

Attended portion of meeting relating to the discussion of alternatives to holding Treasury securities in the System Open Market Account. Return to text By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market         Committee held on September 24, 2002, were approved.      \\t The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.      \\t The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period September 24, 2002, through November 5, 2002.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth had slowed from the moderate pace of the third quarter. Residential construction activity remained high, but consumer spending had softened and business investment was still sluggish. Industrial production had slipped in recent months and private payroll employment had changed little, while labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend. Overall price inflation had fallen over the past year, reflecting both favorable developments in the food and energy sectors and a continuing decline in core inflation.Aggregate labor market conditions weakened further in October. Private nonfarm payroll employment declined in September and October after four previous months of modest gains in hiring. The number of jobs in manufacturing and related industries continued to fall, with losses widely spread. The construction, transportation, and utilities industries also registered further job losses. By contrast, the services sector continued to expand despite job reductions in the help-supply industry, and the strong housing market and mortgage refinancing activity led to brisk hiring in the finance, insurance, and real estate industries. Total hours worked by private production workers moved down in October, and initial claims for unemployment insurance were at a relatively elevated rate. The civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.7 percent in October.Industrial production decreased slightly further in September, and available weekly information pointed to another reduction in output in October. Softness in the manufacturing sector was widespread. In the high-tech sector, output continued to rise, but much less rapidly than earlier in the year. Motor vehicle assemblies ebbed a little from the robust third-quarter pace. Elsewhere in manufacturing, production weakened in many categories, including commercial aircraft, non-auto consumer goods, and various types of business equipment. Capacity utilization in manufacturing edged lower in September and was substantially below its long-run average.In the context of limited gains in personal income and declining consumer confidence, retail sales weakened in September after two months of robust increases. The earlier gains were fueled mainly by very large manufacturer discounts on 2002 models of motor vehicles. Incentives on 2003 models were smaller in September, and consumer response was tepid. Retail sales of non-auto goods also decreased in September after having registered only modest growth in July and August. Outlays for services edged up in September.Residential housing activity, supported by mortgage rates near historical lows, remained very strong in September despite an environment of sluggish employment and declining household wealth. Starts of single-family units reached a twenty-three year high in September, and starts in the multifamily sector were a little above their average since January of this year. Sales of new homes edged up to a record level in September, and sales of existing homes continued to be brisk, though a little below the exceptional pace of the first half of the year. The strength of housing demand was also reflected in further rapid gains in home prices.Business fixed investment edged up in the third quarter, as a pickup in expenditures for equipment and software nearly offset a further sharp decline in spending on nonresidential structures. The return to positive growth of spending for equipment and software was led by robust business outlays for computers and peripheral equipment and for motor vehicles. By contrast, investment in telecommunications equipment and aircraft remained on a steep downward trend. Nonresidential construction activity also continued to decline rapidly, with considerable further reductions in all major categories.The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles registered consecutive gains in July and August after months of heavy liquidation. Despite the recent accumulation, inventory-sales ratios in most industries were at, or near, historic lows.The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened in August, and the average deficit for July and August was virtually unchanged from that for the second quarter. The value of both imports and exports changed little in the July-August period. The available information on economic activity abroad in the third quarter suggested mixed results. Canada apparently grew briskly, and the United Kingdom recorded further moderate economic expansion. In the euro area and Japan, growth appeared to be weakening. The pace of recovery in most of emerging Asia also appeared to have slowed, though China evidently remained on a path of robust expansion. In South America, economic conditions generally remained fragile. Economic activity was still very weak in Argentina and Venezuela, and the Brazilian economy continued to be adversely affected by uncertainties concerning the economic policies of the incoming government. Mexico has been largely unaffected by the financial and political problems of major South American countries, but it nonetheless experienced slower economic growth in the third quarter.Consumer price inflation continued to trend downward in September. The rise in consumer prices for the year ending in September was considerably smaller than that for the previous twelve-month period. While much of that drop reflected developments in the food and energy sectors, core inflation also declined noticeably. Judged by consumer surveys, slower price increases over the past year apparently led consumers to lower their expectations of near-term inflation.  At the producer level, prices for core finished goods likewise decelerated over the twelve months ended in September. With regard to labor costs, growth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers declined significantly over the twelve months ended in September, evidently reflecting the effects of both the rise in unemployment and the drop in consumer price inflation.At its meeting on September 24, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-3/4 percent, and it also retained a balance of risks statement that was tilted toward economic weakness in the foreseeable future. Market participants had anticipated the unchanged policy stance and risk assessment, but the inclusion in the policy announcement of a reference to heightened geopolitical risks led to downward revisions to expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate. The subsequent release of better-than-expected news on profits for several major corporations buoyed equity prices and lifted market interest rates and predicted policy rates. Later in the intermeeting period, weaker-than-anticipated economic data along with press reports suggesting that the FOMC was inclined to ease by year-end led again to downward revisions of the expected path of the federal funds rate target. Over the intermeeting period as a whole, broad equity indexes registered sizable gains and intermediate- and longer-term bond yields increased somewhat.The dollar traded in a narrow range in foreign exchange markets during the intermeeting period. It depreciated slightly in terms of an index of major foreign currencies and was little changed on balance against the currencies of other important trading partners.M2 grew more moderately on average in September and October, with aggregate spending apparently softening, the effects of past monetary easing actions wearing off, and significantly weaker foreign demand for currency emerging. By contrast, the high level of mortgage refinancing activity provided a continuing boost to deposit growth.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, in light of further weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, the expansion of economic activity would be relatively muted for some time. Moreover, current and prospective sluggish economic growth among major trading partners would damp U.S. exports, and businesses and households were likely to hold their spending down while faced with the possibility of a military conflict as well as persisting concerns about the near-term course of economic activity and corporate earnings. Nonetheless, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time and economic activity strengthen gradually. The considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place, continuing gains in structural productivity, and anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus for spending. Inventory overhangs already had been largely eliminated, and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to boost business investment spending. Even so, a less robust pickup in final sales was now expected over the forecast period, which would put somewhat less pressure on resource margins than had been anticipated previously, and the level of activity would remain below the economy's potential for a longer time. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster a slight moderation in core price inflation.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the recent data on the performance of the economy had been disappointing and had tended to confirm widespread anecdotal indications that economic growth had slowed to a pace well below that experienced earlier in the year. Even so, the members acknowledged that the economy had displayed remarkable resiliency over the past year despite being subjected to severe adverse shocks. While the latter clearly had taken their toll on confidence, notably in the business sector, consumer spending had held up relatively well.  Business investment expenditures continued to be constrained by a high degree of uncertainty and related caution. Looking beyond the near term, the members anticipated that as the prevailing uncertainties began to diminish, the economy's resiliency abetted by broadly accommodative monetary and fiscal polices and the continuation of a strong uptrend in productivity would underpin a gradual economic recovery. Indeed, some members commented that an even more robust recovery could not be ruled out in the absence of further major shocks to confidence. With pressures on labor and other resources expected to be limited over coming quarters, inflation was likely to remain subdued and perhaps even to edge a little lower.In their review of developments and prospects in key expenditure sectors of the economy, members noted that consumer spending appeared to have decelerated since midsummer, while an anticipated and hopefully compensating strengthening in business investment had not yet materialized. Factors cited by the members that appeared to help account for the recent softness in consumer demand included substantial decreases in equity wealth, declining consumer confidence in the context of geopolitical and other uncertainties, the waning effects of earlier income tax cuts, and the failure of the most recent round of motor vehicle sales incentives to maintain the extraordinary level of sales seen during the summer. Looking ahead, some members referred to subdued expectations among their retailer contacts regarding the upcoming holiday season, with sales prospects likely to be held back at least marginally by the lingering effects of the recent West Coast dock strike on the availability of merchandise.  There also was some question as to whether funds extracted from rising home equity values would continue to provide as important a source of financing for purchases of consumer durables as they had for some time unless mortgage interest rates declined from their already low levels. Members also mentioned a number of favorable factors bearing on the longer-term outlook for consumer spending. These included the prospect of strengthening consumer confidence  if geopolitical uncertainties began to dissipate, the gradual diminution of the negative wealth effects from earlier stock market declines, and importantly the outlook for continued robust growth in structural labor productivity and its favorable effects over time on wages and salaries. High and persisting uncertainty and concomitant aversion to risk among business executives apparently continued to hold down business investment spending. While such expenditures remained at a high level, members saw few signs of a significant pickup in the nearer term. Apart from notably adverse business sentiment and disappointing growth in sales and profits, factors that were curbing capital expenditures cited by members included persisting capital overhangs stemming from what were now seen as excessive earlier buildups in equipment and software and substantial idle capacity in many industrial and commercial structures. Some divergence of opinion was expressed regarding the overall extent of capital overhangs, though it was clearly evident in some industries and in high vacancy rates in nonresidential buildings in many areas of the country. Looking to the future, the timing and strength of a decisive upturn in capital expenditures, a key factor in the outlook for some improvement in the performance of the overall economy, would depend critically on the dissipation of prevailing uncertainties, including those associated with geopolitical risks, and increasing prospects for profits. In the latter regard, it was suggested that in the context of rising productivity, profits could prove to be stronger than many now expected, with favorable implications for cash flows and in turn investment activity. Cautious business attitudes and expectations of sluggish sales over coming months were inducing business firms to continue to hold down what were already generally lean inventories. Nonetheless, some members commented that inventory accumulation was likely to provide some limited impetus to the economy over the next several quarters to the extent that an acceleration in economic activity occurred and businesses sought to maintain an acceptable balance between their inventories and sales. Indeed, with inventories at unusually low levels in many industries, efforts to rebuild such inventories appeared inevitable.Housing activity had remained at a generally elevated level in recent months and in the context of low mortgage interest rates likely would continue to provide important support to the economy over the forecast period. Most regional reports indicated persisting strength in the housing sector, though there was evidence of modestly flagging activity in some areas. In this regard, it was noted that the declining trend in mortgage interest rates probably would not continue once forecasts of a strengthening economic expansion began to materialize. Indeed, the rise in bond yields since the September meeting associated with the improvement in the stock market had induced a small increase in mortgage rates from their very low levels. At some point the extraordinary levels of cash-outs from mortgage refinancings and home sales would undoubtedly moderate, with adverse implications for spending on home improvements and consumer durables more generally. Still, household spending probably would continue to be supported by the increases in income and wealth associated with strengthening economic expansion and rising productivity.    Members commented that fiscal policy remained accommodative, but an analysis cited at this meeting suggested that the stimulus embodied in current legislation had diminished considerably since earlier in the year. Reference also was made to the partial expensing provision of the tax legislation enacted in March of this year, which was seen as a positive but not in itself a compelling factor in inducing expenditures on business equipment and software. Some members observed that further federal tax cuts, should they be enacted, would likely take effect too late to foster much added spending over the year ahead. At the state and local government levels, efforts to control very large deficits likely would lead to tax and spending legislation that would offset at least part of the remaining stimulus inherent in the federal budget.Members commented that little if any stimulus could be expected from the export sector of the economy in light of current and prospective shortfalls in the economic performance of important U.S. trading partners. Indeed, recent forecasts incorporated downward revisions to the growth of overall foreign economic activity.With the economy evidently on a lower-than-anticipated growth path and with slack in labor and product markets at elevated levels, members anticipated that inflation would remain quite subdued over the year ahead even in the context of some anticipated acceleration in economic activity.  Indeed, the prospect of some persisting slack in resource use over coming quarters pointed to further disinflation. In this regard, some members referred to the possibility, which they viewed as remote, of a period of deflation in the event of a strongly negative demand shock.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members favored a proposal to reduce the target for the intended federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1-1/4 percent. While the current stance of monetary policy was still accommodative and was providing important support to economic activity, the members were concerned that the generally disappointing data since the previous meeting, reinforcing the general thrust of the anecdotal evidence in recent months, pointed to a longer-lasting spell of subpar economic performance than they had anticipated earlier.  In the circumstances, a relatively aggressive easing action could help to ensure that the current soft spot in the economy would prove to be temporary and enhance the odds of a robust rebound in economic activity next year. A further reason cited by some members for a sizable easing move related to their perceptions of a diminishing stimulus from earlier policy easing actions and indications that overall financial conditions, including bank lending terms, had become more restrictive this year even though the nominal federal funds rate target had not been changed since late 2001. The members agreed that monetary policy could do little to improve the performance of the economy in the near term, but some emphasized that a 50 basis point easing likely would feed through to some degree to market interest rates, with favorable implications for spending next year.Members commented that the potential costs of a policy easing action that later proved not to have been needed were quite limited in that there was little risk that such a move would foster inflationary pressures under likely economic conditions over the next several quarters. Moreover, the policy easing could readily be unwound without significant effects on financial markets if the reversal appeared to be warranted by growing pressures on resources in a strengthening economy. In contrast, a failure to take an action that was needed because of a faltering economic performance would increase the odds of a cumulatively weakening economy and possibly even attendant deflation. An effort to offset such a development, should it appear to be materializing, would present difficult policy implementation problems. All the members indicated that, in light of the contemplated 50 basis point easing action, they could support a shift in the Committee's assessment of the risks to the economy from tilted toward economic weakness to balanced for the foreseeable future, although some voiced reservations about the need for such a shift. The economy probably would continue to underperform in the period immediately ahead, but in the absence of unpredictable adverse shocks this sluggish performance was more likely to be balanced by subsequent economic strength in light of the policy action. A 50 basis point move would tend to have a more pronounced effect than usual in financial markets, at least initially, because it would be largely unexpected and would come after an extended hiatus in implementing policy changes. In the view of many members, retaining the assessment that the risks were tilted toward weakness would raise the odds of an overreaction in financial markets, which might well misread the Committee's decision as a sign that the members were more concerned about the potential for greater economic weakness than was in fact the case and that therefore the Committee currently saw a likely need for further easing later. Some members saw a lesser risk of such a development, partly because of widespread market expectations that even with a sizable reduction in the intended federal funds rate the Committee would not change its assessment of unbalanced risks to the economy in present circumstances. Although they had at least a marginal preference for retaining the current tilt toward weakness, these members were willing to accept a balanced statement in light of the uncertainties that surrounded prospective market reactions. While the possible market response was not a primary factor determining the desirability of a  policy action, the Committee needed to take it into account in gauging the potential effects of particular policy moves.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:                 The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 1-1/4 percent.The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in         the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are balanced with respect to prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future.Votes for this action:  Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Gramlich, Jordan, Kohn, McTeer, Olson, Santomero, and Stern.    Votes against this action: None.Use of Alternative Assets in Open Market OperationsAt this meeting the Committee provided further guidance to the staff on priorities for the continuing study of alternatives to Treasury securities in the conduct of System open market operations. At its meeting in March of this year, the Committee had reaffirmed its preference for the use of Treasury securities to implement the System's monetary policy, contingent upon the continued availability of a sufficient outstanding volume of such obligations to accommodate the System's very large operations.  As was already apparent at the time of the March meeting, fiscal policy developments made it clear that earlier concerns about a contracting supply of securities in the U.S. government securities market would not likely impose constraints on the System's open market operations in the near term.  Even so, the members expressed a consensus in favor of continuing to study alternatives to Treasury obligations for potential future use. Pursuant to the Committee's instructions in March, the staff had activated its study of the possible employment of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Maes) in outright System open market operations. Such obligations were already being utilized for temporary additions to the System's portfolio through repurchase agreements.  During their discussion at this meeting, the members recognized that outright purchases of Ginnie Maes for permanent additions to the System's portfolio would present a number of difficulties and would require extensive preparations for their effective integration, if deemed desirable at a later date, into the conduct of outright System open market operations. Still, in view of their possible advantages in helping to meet SOMA portfolio objectives at some point in the future, the Committee instructed the staff to continue to focus available resources on the possible use of Ginnie Maes for such operations. The Committee also decided to discontinue further consideration of the possible use of foreign sovereign debt obligations as collateral for repurchase agreements in light of the problems that were envisaged in the employment of such securities.  At this meeting the Committee also reviewed work that had been done on the potential use of an auction credit facility (ACF) that could serve as a partial substitute for Treasury or other securities. In addition, the Committee reviewed a study that considered whether an ACF might be adapted for use in a contingency (CACF) as a full substitute for open market operations. Many of the members commended the staff for its careful assessment of the potential for such operations. The members concluded, however, that significant resources should not be assigned at this time to the further study of these alternatives to open market operations given the prospects for an enlarged supply of Treasury obligations, the decision to focus on Ginnie Maes, and the introduction of a new discount window program, the System's primary credit facility, scheduled for implementation in early 2003. In addition, the CACF had been made unnecessary by the implementation of contingency plans and backup facilities since September 2001. The members concurred with the staff's recommendation that the staff studies prepared for the Committee in January 2001, when it discussed in detail various alternatives to holding U.S. government securities, should be released to the public after light editing was completed.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, December 10, 2002.

Elsasser and Furlong, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of New York and San Francisco respectivelyBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on November 6, 2002, were approved.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.\\t\\tThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period November 6, 2002, through December 9, 2002.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth had been sluggish on balance since midsummer. Housing demand remained strong, but business fixed investment was still in the doldrums and consumer spending had flagged in late summer before apparently picking up somewhat in the autumn. Payroll employment had changed little since midyear, and industrial production still seemed to be on a downward trend. Most price indexes continued to indicate that inflation had declined over the past year.Private nonfarm payroll employment remained stagnant in the third quarter and edged down in October and November. Job losses in manufacturing were again large in the two months, and employment declined in construction and in the wholesale and retail trade industries. By contrast, services (except help-supply) and the finance, insurance, and real estate grouping recorded further solid gains. The unemployment rate rose to 6 percent in November, a level more consonant with other recent labor market indicators. Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector continued to climb briskly, with the advance over the last four quarters being the largest since 1973.Industrial production dropped sharply further in October, with roughly half of the decline related to a slowdown in motor vehicle assemblies and the manufacture of related parts. The rest of the manufacturing sector also was weak on balance, with output down in almost all market groups. The high-tech sector was an exception, although the rise in output of computers and semiconductors in October was smaller than earlier in the year and the production of communications equipment continued to fall. Consistent with the poor performance of industrial production, capacity utilization in manufacturing fell again in October and remained substantially below its long-run average.Against the backdrop of smaller gains in disposable personal income and low readings on consumer confidence, growth of consumer spending had been quite sluggish in the last several months. Much of the weakness reflected a falloff in spending on new motor vehicles in September and October, largely because of reduced manufacturer discounts. Apart from motor vehicles, personal consumption expenditures picked up in October following two months of softness. Increases in outlays for services in September and October remained modest and about equal to the average rate of rise earlier in the year.Housing starts dropped moderately in October, which was an unusually wet month across much of the country. However, residential housing activity had been very strong on balance this year despite an environment of sluggish employment and declining household wealth. Mortgage rates near historical lows had provided important support for single-family housing demand, and sales of new and existing homes had remained buoyant. In the multifamily sector, starts plunged in October to the slowest pace in almost six years. While some of the decline likely was attributable to inclement weather, apartment vacancy rates had risen significantly over the past year, perhaps partly in response to the single-family housing boom.Business spending on equipment and software increased moderately in the third quarter, but the recent monthly pattern of data on shipments and orders for nondefense capital goods, along with anecdotal reports from businesses, signaled renewed weakness. Shipments of nondefense capital goods rebounded in October, led by a rise in computing equipment. In contrast, shipments of communications equipment plunged. Construction in the nonresidential sector slowed sharply further in the third quarter, but a few signs, including a rise in activity in October, suggested some moderation in the rate of decline.The aggregate book value of manufacturing inventories changed little in October: declines in stocks of many types of durable goods were offset by modest stockbuilding of nondurables, and the ratio of stocks to shipments remained very low. Anecdotal information suggested that disruptions of West Coast dock operations stemming from a labor dispute had been quite small.The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services changed little in September and the third quarter. The available information on economic activity abroad in the third quarter indicated that economic expansion remained moderate in the United Kingdom and sluggish in the euro area. Economic growth subsided somewhat from elevated second-quarter rates in Canada, Japan, and emerging Asia. Economic conditions in South America were generally still fragile.Core consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) and the chain-weighted personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, continued to trend lower in October. Inflation, in terms of both indexes, was down over the last twelve months when compared with the previous twelve-month period. At the producer level, core price inflation for finished goods over the twelve months ended in October was at a very low rate. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased moderately in November, and the growth in those earnings over the last twelve months fell considerably, evidently reflecting the slack in labor markets.At its meeting on November 6, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for lowering the target for the intended federal funds rate by 50 basis points, to 1-1/4 percent. The Committee also agreed that, in light of the decision to ease, it would be appropriate to indicate in the press release that the risks were balanced for the foreseeable future. Market participants had expected a 25 basis point cut and retention of a statement of risks toward weakness. The unexpectedly large reduction in the federal funds rate target led to an initial decline in Treasury coupon yields. That drop was reversed when market participants apparently focused on the shift to balanced risks and concluded that the odds of pronounced economic weakness had fallen. The subsequent release of better-than-expected economic data and earnings news provided reassurance to investors, though more mixed economic reports became available late in the intermeeting period. Over the period as a whole, major equity indexes registered mixed changes, and yields on longer-term Treasury bonds increased somewhat. In private debt markets, rates on investment-grade debt issues eased a little, and those on speculative-grade bonds fell considerably more.  The dollar appreciated slightly in terms of an index of major foreign currencies, principally against the yen, and changed little against the currencies of other important trading partners. The dollar edged lower against most major currencies in the aftermath of the policy easing on November 6, but those losses were subsequently retraced after the release of U.S. economic data that were seen as suggesting relatively better economic conditions in the United States.M2 growth slowed a little in November from October's elevated pace. The further advance again was concentrated in liquid deposits. The low level of opportunity costs and heavy mortgage financing continued to support the demand for liquid assets.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would be relatively muted over the near term. Faced with heightened geopolitical tensions as well as persisting concerns about the near-term course of economic activity and corporate earnings, businesses and households were likely to hold down their spending, and the outlook for continued sluggish economic growth among most major trading partners would damp U.S. exports. However, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time, and the considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place, continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to provide a gradual boost to business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster a slight moderation in core price inflation.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members noted that the recent information had continued on the whole to suggest quite sluggish economic growth. Uncertainties about the outlook remained substantial, and downside risks stemming from potential shocks, notably those associated with a high level of geopolitical risks, could not be dismissed. Nonetheless, the behavior of financial markets in recent weeks suggested that investor concerns about an actual downturn in the economy had diminished, as data on economic developments took on a more mixed tone after having been somewhat negative for some time. The improvement in financial markets reinforced the members' expectations that a gradual strengthening of the economic expansion was likely over coming quarters, with the growth in economic activity gaining momentum over time in the absence of major adverse shocks to business and consumer confidence. Their assessment took account of the currently very accommodative stance of monetary policy, likely further fiscal policy stimulus, and the positive effects on business and consumer spending of a strong uptrend in labor productivity.  With regard to the outlook for inflation, the gap between actual and potential output was anticipated to diminish only slowly unless aggregate demand expanded much more rapidly than the members currently foresaw. Given the persistence of limited pressures on resources, cost and price increases were expected to remain subdued and possibly to edge lower.The improvement of overall conditions in financial markets had provided an additional positive element to the economic outlook. The improvement began before the November meeting and had been given added impetus by the Committee's sizable easing at that meeting. The general calming of financial markets was reflected in some decline in risk spreads from very high levels and sizable new issuance in private bond markets; in equity markets, issuance had edged up and stock prices, though recently declining somewhat, were still well above the lows of early October. Some of this improvement in financial markets seemed to be related to apparently lessening concerns about new revelations of corporate governance issues as a result of the passage of time without further significant incidents. In addition, many business firms had continued to enhance their prospects for rising profits through productivity improvements and debt restructurings that were strengthening their balance sheets and liquidity. Concurrently, indicators of credit quality in the household sector appeared to have remained essentially stable. Reference also was made to the continued robust growth in reserve and money measures.The better tone in financial markets might also have been signaling a modest reduction in uncertainty and risk aversion among business executives from the extraordinarily elevated levels that had been constraining investment spending. Lingering excess capacity in a number of industries undoubtedly was continuing to inhibit new investment outlays as well. The members agreed that a pickup in capital spending remained the essential factor in the outlook for substantial strengthening of economic activity. On the positive side, spending for business equipment had turned up since early this year, and with efforts to reduce excess capacity seemingly well under way or completed in many industries, further firming in such capital expenditures was anticipated as the year 2003 progressed. However, nonresidential building was expected to continue to lag, especially given high vacancy rates in industrial and office structures in many major markets.The household sector of the economy had continued to provide major support to the recovery in economic activity. The increase in consumer spending evidently had moderated in the current quarter, largely as a result of a decline in sales of motor vehicles from an extraordinary pace during the summer. However, the latest information on retail sales, including anecdotal reports, pointed to some improvement in recent weeks, and key measures of consumer confidence had turned up from their recent lows. While some uncertainty surrounded the prospects for consumer spending, members cited continued sizable increases in income, more stable wealth-to-income ratios, and the ongoing stimulus of equity extractions from housing as favorable factors in the outlook for consumer expenditures.Housing activity had continued to display solid overall strength, though members mentioned weakness in multifamily construction and the high-end sector of the single-family market. Historically low mortgage interest rates along with rising incomes evidently were continuing to sustain the robust demand for housing.  In addition, large extractions of equity from appreciated housing values continued to foster not only added consumer spending but also improvement in the financial condition of many households through debt consolidation and repayments and reduced interest charges. However, there were anecdotal indications of decreasing refinancing activity in the housing sector.The outcome of the recent Congressional elections had fostered expectations that fiscal policy might be more expansive than previously anticipated, although the size, timing, and composition of federal budget initiatives were subject to substantial uncertainty.  Members commented that added fiscal stimulus might prove to be a useful complement to an accommodative monetary policy in the period immediately ahead when economic activity was likely to remain below the economy's potential. In this regard, some observed that additional stimulus on the federal level would be an offset to measures that were being taken by numerous state and local governments to address severe budget deficits. At the same time, a number of members expressed the hope that new fiscal legislation would not endanger the prospects for federal budget discipline over the longer run, given the desirability of supporting national saving and capital accumulation.With regard to the external sector, members commented that the growth of the nation's important trading partners had remained sluggish, and there seemed to be little basis for anticipating any appreciable impetus to the U.S. economy from significant strengthening in demand for U.S. exports. Indeed, economic growth abroad was widely viewed as dependent to a significant extent on the performance of the U.S. economy. Conditions in some major Latin American countries were especially problematic, and adverse developments there could have negative repercussions on international financial markets and trade.Members believed that the economy probably would continue to operate with significant margins of slack in both labor and product markets. Moreover, in an environment characterized by highly competitive markets and the absence of pricing power, business firms would persist in their efforts to hold down or reduce costs, with favorable implications for productivity. In these circumstances, inflation pressures could be expected to remain subdued and some further disinflation might well occur. In this regard, members commented that appreciable disinflation seemed unlikely, but if that were to occur it could present difficult problems for monetary policy.  One member noted, however, that declining inflation or even some deflation in the context of rapid growth in productivity could turn out to be relatively benign.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to retain the current stance of policy. The members agreed that, given what was now a quite accommodative policy following the relatively aggressive easing move in November, monetary policy was well positioned to support a strengthening economic expansion in line with their expectations for coming quarters. Although it was uncertain how long the current period of below-par growth would persist, the economic outlook remained subject to upside as well as downside risks. Indeed, all the members also supported the retention of the current balanced-risks statement in the post-meeting press release, with some commenting that recent developments had established a firmer basis for such a risk assessment than at the November meeting when it was adopted. The November easing had contributed to some improvement in financial markets that, in conjunction with prospects for further stimulus from fiscal policy, should bolster the anticipated acceleration of economic activity. At the same time, the members saw little risk of any significant increase in inflationary pressures over the foreseeable future. Against this background, the members concluded that there was no need to change the stance of monetary policy; they would continue to assess emerging economic and financial developments, retaining the flexibility to adjust monetary policy as emerging conditions might warrant.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:    The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1-1/4 percent.  The vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are balanced with respect to prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future. \\t         Votes for this action:  Messrs.

The Authorization as amended read as follows:AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS(Amended January 28, 2003) The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; provided that the aggregate amount of U.S. Government and Federal agency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments) at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not be increased or decreased by more than $12.0 billion during the period commencing with the opening of business on the day following such a meeting and ending with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting; (b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account.     (c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States to dealers for System Open Market Account under agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers.In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be determined by competitive bidding.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and apply reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue that may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each dealer may borrow.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could facilitate a dealer\\'s ability to control a single issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such foreign and international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Bank.  Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.In the execution of the Committee\\'s decision regarding policy during any intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate.  Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee\\'s discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period.  Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any adjustment.With Mr. Broaddus dissenting, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive were reaffirmed as shown below.AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS(Reaffirmed January 28, 2003)The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent necessary to carry out the Committee\\'s foreign currency directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time to time:\\t     A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Treasury, with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with other international financial institutions:Canadian dollarsDanish kronerEuroPounds sterlingJapanese yenMexican pesosNorwegian kronerSwedish kronorSwiss francs     B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above.     C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.     D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding $25.0 billion.  For this purpose, the overall open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies.  The net position in a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (\"swap\" arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity:Foreign bankAmount of arrangement(millions of dollars equivalent)Bank of Canada2,000Bank of Mexico3,000Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates.  For the purpose of providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign currencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at nonmarket exchange rates.It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions.  In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  When appropriate in connection with arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency holdings, U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign central banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar days.All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee.  The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, his alternate).  Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the request of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), for the purposes of reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other matters relating to his responsibilities.  At the request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open Market Committee.The Chairman is authorized:     A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the Treasury;     B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary on policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;     C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors\\' Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE(Reaffirmed January 28, 2003) System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1.To achieve this end the System shall:     A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign exchange.     B. Maintain reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with selected foreign central banks.     C. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other countries and with international monetary institutions.Transactions may also be undertaken:       A. To adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies.     B. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund.     C. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the Committee.System foreign currency operations shall be conducted: A. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the United States              Treasury;     B. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary authorities; and     C. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United States in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange arrangements under the IMF Article IV.Mr. Broaddus dissented in the votes on the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive because they provide the foundation for foreign exchange market intervention. For the same reasons he had given in the past when he had dissented on these policy instruments, he continued to believe that the Federal Reserve\\'s participation in foreign exchange market intervention compromises its ability to conduct monetary policy effectively.By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations were reaffirmed in the form shown below.  PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TOFOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS(Reaffirmed January 28, 2003)         In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), shall be guided by the following procedural understandings with respect to consultations and clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee.  All operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available): A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.      B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the System\\'s net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with repayment of swap drawings.      C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change in the System\\'s net position in that currency might be less than the limits specified in 1.B.      D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):        A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.      B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any operations that are not of a routine character.By unanimous vote, the Committee approved the repeal of paragraphs 3 through 6 of the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations in Federal Agency Issues. The Committee initially suspended these paragraphs in August 1999 and subsequently extended the suspension annually for the years through 2002. Paragraphs 1 and 2, which provide general guidance for the conduct of System open market operations in federal agency obligations, were retained in their existing form.  GUIDELINES FOR THE CONDUCT OF SYSTEM OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS IN FEDERAL AGENCY ISSUES(Amended January 28, 2003)System open market operations in Federal agency issues are an integral part of total System open market operations designed to influence bank reserves, money market conditions, and monetary aggregates.System open market operations in Federal agency issues are not designed to support individual sectors of the market or to channel funds into issues of particular agencies.By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Program for Security of FOMC Information on January 28, 2003, to update references to the classification of confidential documents and to clarify some of its instructions for safeguarding confidential information. By unanimous vote, the Committee amended the Temporary Authority to Operate the System Account to authorize the Chairman to appoint an interim manager of the System Open Market Account in emergency circumstances. The amended Temporary Authority read as follows:TEMPORARY AUTHORITY TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM ACCOUNT(Amended January 28, 2003)The Chairman of the Committee is authorized to appoint a Federal Reserve Bank as agent to operate the System Account temporarily in case the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is unable to function.   In the event the Chairman exercises such authority, the Chairman also is authorized to appoint a Federal Reserve official to act temporarily as Manager of the System Account.By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 10, 2002, were approved.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period December 10, 2002, through January 28, 2003.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.At this meeting the Committee discussed staff presentations on whether policy adjustments incorporating gradual movements in the federal funds rate were desirable in terms of optimally achieving the Committee\\'s macroeconomic objectives.  The staff presentations examined whether policy adjustments historically had been implemented gradually or whether, instead, the observed tendency for the federal funds rate to move slowly through time reflected the behavior of the underlying variables to which policy was responding. Members expressed a range of views regarding the evidence and its implications for policy, including potential situations that might call for relatively aggressive policy actions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth was very slow in the fourth quarter. Housing demand and consumer spending firmed toward the end of the year, but capital spending remained quite weak in an environment of substantial business uncertainty and pessimism. A sharp drop in motor vehicle output held down overall industrial production, and the labor market deteriorated further. Core consumer price inflation continued to decline through the end of the year.Private nonfarm payroll employment fell again in December and was at its lowest level since September 1999. Job losses in manufacturing continued to be sizable, and employment in retail trade plunged, although part of that decline might have been attributable to lower-than-usual hiring of temporary sales help for the holiday season. By contrast, hiring in the services industry picked up, and employment in the finance, insurance, and real estate group continued to expand. The unemployment rate held at 6 percent in December, a level consistent with other labor market indicators. Industrial production slowed a little further in December, reflecting another sharp drop in motor vehicle assemblies and a decline in electricity generation. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output increased slightly following small declines in October and November. Production of high-tech goods continued to rise in December, and output in industries other than high-tech and transportation increased for the first time since August. Despite the uptick in production in some areas of manufacturing, capacity utilization in manufacturing fell again in December and was substantially below its long-run average.Retail sales increased appreciably in November and December even though disposable personal income posted relatively modest gains and readings on consumer confidence were generally low. Purchases of new motor vehicles were brisk and were accompanied by moderate further increases in other categories of retail sales. Residential housing activity remained strong through the end of the year, despite continued sluggish employment and additional declines in household wealth. With mortgage rates remaining near historical lows, single-family housing starts increased further in November and December, and the backlog of unused permits along with other information suggested that starts likely would remain strong in coming months. New home sales reached yet another record high in December, and existing home sales neared their record level established in January 2002. In the multifamily sector, starts rebounded in November and December from a sharp drop in October. Nonetheless, multifamily homebuilding was at a relatively low level at year-end, reflecting falling rents and high vacancy rates.Business spending on equipment and software appeared to have little or no forward momentum in the fourth quarter and to have been weaker than might have been suggested by the recent pattern of business output, corporate cash flow, and the user cost of capital. Both shipments of and orders for nondefense capital goods turned down in the fourth quarter, with aircraft and communications equipment registering the steepest declines in shipments. In the nonresidential sector, construction activity slowed only a little further in October and November following a sharp drop in the third quarter. However, current weakness in rents and property values suggested continued deterioration in activity.The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles dropped sharply in October and changed little in November. Manufacturers trimmed stocks in both months, though durable goods manufacturers increased their inventories sharply in December. Wholesalers cut their inventories substantially in October and held them steady in November. Retail inventories changed little over the two-month period. Aggregate inventory-sales ratios in all three categories remained at very low levels.The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened significantly in November, with the value of imports rising more than that of exports. Combining October and November, imports increased from the third-quarter average while exports declined somewhat. Available information on economic activity abroad in the fourth quarter suggested slower growth on average in the major foreign economies. Economic expansion in Japan appeared to have slowed markedly, and growth in the euro area remained sluggish. By contrast, the Canadian economy continued to expand briskly while activity in the United Kingdom seemed to be growing more moderately. In the emerging market economies, conditions in South America were generally still fragile, the pace of economic recovery in Mexico appeared to have slowed, and growth had softened in much of emerging Asia. Economic growth in China remained strong.Core consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) and the chain-weighted personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, continued to edge lower through the end of the year. However, the sizable run-up in energy prices last year boosted overall consumer price inflation somewhat on a year-over-year basis. At the producer level, core prices for finished goods declined in November and December, but for the year as a whole the jump in energy prices pushed overall producer prices for finished goods up slightly. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased moderately in December, but the change in those earnings over the year was considerably smaller than in 2001, evidently reflecting the slack in labor markets.At its meeting on December 10, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-1/4 percent and retained an assessment that the risks to its longer-term objectives were balanced. The Committee noted that monetary policy was quite accommodative and well positioned to support a strengthening economic expansion in line with the members\\' expectations for coming quarters. The Committee\\'s decision was widely anticipated and elicited little reaction. Financial markets were sensitive, however, to shifting perceptions of global risks, economic releases that generally were seen as having a disappointing tone, pessimistic expectations for fourth-quarter corporate profits, and the Administration\\'s announcement of an economic stimulus package larger than had been anticipated. Against that backdrop, longer-term Treasury yields declined somewhat while, in private debt markets, a sense of reduced concern about governance issues and perhaps some increased appetite for risk-taking led to a substantial decline in yields across the credit spectrum that further narrowed risk spreads. Major stock price indexes moved widely during the intermeeting period, but most finished the period a little lower.The dollar depreciated substantially in terms of an index of major foreign currencies, with particularly large declines against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss franc. Market worries about growing tensions over Iraq and North Korea appeared to be a key factor, but concerns about the downbeat tone of recent U.S. economic data and the potential vulnerability of the dollar to a general pullback of international capital further damped market sentiment. The drop of the dollar occurred despite continued signs of weak growth in the euro area and Japan and sizable reductions in the yields of their long-term government securities.Growth of M2 fell considerably in December. Much of the deceleration was concentrated in the liquid components of the aggregate, likely reflecting in part an adjustment in the volume of mortgage refinancings and the associated prepayments on mortgage-backed securities.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would be muted in the very near term. Faced with intensified geopolitical tensions as well as continuing pessimism about the near-term course of economic activity, labor market conditions, and corporate earnings, businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending. In addition, continued sluggish economic growth among most major trading partners would tend to damp U.S. exports. However, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time.  The considerable monetary ease already in place, the prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus, the continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and the anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated, and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to gradually boost business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources would tend to foster some moderation in core price inflation.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members emphasized that their forecasts were subject to substantial uncertainties, dominated at this point by the geopolitical situation, but they continued to view a pickup in economic growth as a reasonable expectation for the year ahead. Household spending had been well maintained over the course of recent months, but a high degree of caution had induced business firms to continue to hold down their spending and hiring. It was suggested that the uncertainties relating to geopolitical tensions and possible war in Iraq, important factors contributing to business caution, might be at least partly resolved in the near term, helping to roll back some of the recent increase in oil prices and likely having favorable implications for consumer and business spending. Even so, the response of the economy was hard to anticipate because of the difficulty of disentangling the effects of current geopolitical tensions from the underlying momentum of the economy. Moreover, even a short and successful military campaign could give rise to a variety of disruptions that might limit at least for a time an improvement in business and consumer confidence. The members nonetheless saw a number of favorable factors that could be expected to foster a relatively robust economic expansion over time. These included a stimulative monetary policy along with generally accommodative financial conditions, the prospect of additional fiscal stimulus, an increasing need for expenditures by business firms to replace depreciated equipment and to maintain acceptable inventory levels, and continued vigorous growth in productivity that would support profits and incomes. With regard to the outlook for inflation, prospective growth of spending in line with the members\\' forecasts likely would continue to be associated with only muted pressures on labor and other resources over the year ahead, and given current trends in productivity, members anticipated that consumer price inflation would remain subdued; indeed, modest further disinflation might occur over the year ahead.      In preparing for the semiannual monetary policy report to Congress, the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents provided individual projections of the growth of GDP, civilian unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2003. The members agreed that because of the unusual uncertainties that clouded their current forecasts, the latter should be viewed as having extremely wide confidence bands. Their forecasts envisaged a strengthening economic recovery but not one that was likely to induce a material, if any, decline in the unemployment rate over the year ahead. Their forecasts of growth in real GDP for 2003 had a central tendency of 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent and a full range of 3 to 3-3/4 percent, measured as the change between the fourth quarter of 2002 and the fourth quarter of 2003. Their projections of the civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year were all in a range of 5-3/4 to 6 percent. Their forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, with a full range of 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 percent.In the Committee\\'s discussion of developments in key sectors of the economy, members continued to place emphasis on the critical role of business spending and hiring decisions in determining the strength of the expansion. An elevated level of business caution clearly was holding back investment spending, and there were few signs of a pickup in the near term. Given an eventual reduction in prevailing uncertainties, however, a number of members noted that the outlook for business spending was favorable, and they did not rule out a sharp snapback in business expenditures as the year progressed. Factors cited in support of this view included the wide availability and low cost of capital, the increasing need for replacing worn and outdated capital equipment with the passage of time, a decline in overall stocks of capital in relation to the economy\\'s growing potential, and the anticipated continuation of what appeared to be an upward trend in sales, cash flows, and profits. Some members also referred to the positive effects on some business decisions of the temporary federal tax incentives for expenditures on business equipment and software. The members agreed that the strength and timing of the prospective improvement remained subject to a high degree of uncertainty.  Indeed, a number of members commented that it was possible that some easing of geopolitical tensions would not lead to a major near-term upturn in business confidence and business expenditures.  Such an outcome would be especially likely if oil supplies were disrupted, a threat that could not be ruled out, with adverse consequences for oil prices and business costs.  Moreover, the current excess capacity would permit many firms to meet likely demands for some period of time without a significant increase in capital investments.The evident uncertainty and pessimism in the business community were also reflected in tight inventory control policies. Despite continuing gains in final sales, inventories were estimated to have changed little in the fourth quarter and currently were at levels that were widely viewed as unusually low in relation to sales. In these circumstances, an easing at some point of current uncertainties and strengthening confidence should induce inventory rebuilding, with positive implications, at least for a time, for the expansion of economic activity. The household sector had continued to provide vital support to overall demand in recent months despite a deteriorating trend in consumer confidence. While numerous contacts reported generally disappointing holiday sales in an environment of atypically large and widespread discounting, a surge in motor vehicle sales in December fostered by aggressive sales incentives and some pickup in retail sales late in the holiday season helped to sustain moderate overall growth in consumer spending through the year-end. Looking ahead, a number of factors seemed likely to undergird consumer spending, including the positive effects on permanent incomes of robust ongoing growth in productivity, the possibly accelerated phase-in of tax reductions stemming from earlier legislation, the prospects for additional reductions in federal taxes affecting household incomes, and more generally the continued favorable effects of low interest rates and widely available financing on consumer purchases of motor vehicles and other durables. At the same time, some members expressed concern about the potential for adverse effects on consumer incomes and confidence should stagnant conditions persist in labor markets and equity markets weaken further.  Reference also was made to the possibility suggested by some analysts that the value of housing wealth might be leveling off.  In that event mortgage refinancings might moderate once mortgage rates stabilized, reducing the impetus to consumer spending from this source. Statistical indicators of housing activity and anecdotal reports from numerous parts of the country pointed to persisting strength in homebuilding, with no signs of a slowdown in most areas. Members generally anticipated that activity in this sector of the economy would be well maintained in the context of low mortgage rates and further growth in incomes, but a few expressed reservations about forecasts of a further pickup this year. The members anticipated the enactment of new legislation that would add to the fiscal stimulus that was already incorporated in earlier legislation. While greater fiscal stimulus appeared to be desirable to counter near-term weakness in the economy, the new legislation probably could not be enacted in time to begin to exert an expansionary impact on the economy before the latter part of this year when the anticipated strengthening of the economy might already be well under way.  Members also observed that, given the competing legislative proposals currently under consideration, the eventual components and size of that legislation were very uncertain at this point, though they were likely to be importantly influenced by the performance of the economy and especially labor market conditions over coming months. A number of members expressed the hope that the legislation would not encompass provisions that would lead to permanently large federal deficits with negative consequences for the economy over the longer term. As they had at previous meetings, members also commented on the severe fiscal problems being experienced by numerous state and local governments. It was noted that state revenue shortfalls were being aggravated by federally mandated costs related to homeland security that were not, at least currently, being reimbursed by the federal government. Another problem related to certain tax proposals under consideration in the Congress, notably the exclusion of dividends from income, that could have adverse consequences for the revenues of numerous state and local governments that linked their taxable incomes to those reported on federal returns. More generally, while state and local efforts to redress budget imbalances were likely to offset only a small part of the probable stimulus in forthcoming federal legislation, some members commented that those efforts might well involve more fiscal restraint than was currently foreseen by some analysts. Largely reflecting their expectations of ongoing, albeit diminishing, slack in labor and product markets, the members anticipated that consumer price inflation probably would edge down over the next several quarters from an already low level. Members also referred to a number of crosscurrents bearing on the outlook for prices that included the adverse effects of recent declines in the dollar and higher oil prices but also the opposing effects of a strong uptrend in productivity and highly competitive markets in holding down prices and costs. With regard to labor costs, members cited anecdotal evidence of persisting weakness in numerous regional labor markets and, given the current reluctance of employers to add to their workforces, the prospect that job gains and labor compensation would tend to lag the anticipated strengthening in economic activity, as they often had in the past. In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. While the economy had continued to grow slowly, monetary policy and overall financial conditions had remained accommodative and the prospects for an appreciable strengthening of the economic expansion over time were favorable. As some of the prevailing uncertainties currently impairing spending began to lift, possibly in the near term with regard to military developments in the Middle East, the Committee should be in a much better position to assess the underlying strength of the economy and the appropriate policy response. At this point, the Committee could not rule out a range of plausible economic outcomes, including the possibility of a persisting subpar economic performance or a much stronger than forecast acceleration of the expansion. Indeed, the Committee could envision circumstances when it might find it desirable to adjust its policy stance substantially and promptly in one direction or the other in the months ahead. The members concluded that a wait-and-see policy stance was desirable pending an improved basis for judging the ongoing performance of the economy. They also agreed that the accommodative stance of policy, developments over the intermeeting period, and their current forecasts in the context of tensions abroad argued for retaining a balanced risks assessment to be included in the statement that would be made public shortly after this meeting.At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:            The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1-1/4 percent.  The votes encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting.             Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are balanced with respect to prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, and Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, and Parry.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.\\t\\tThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period January 29, 2003, through March 17, 2003. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity remained subpar in the opening months of the year. While the underlying demand for residential housing continued to be robust and government outlays evidently were rising, the expansion of consumer spending seemed to have slowed, and outlays for capital spending were still very sluggish in an environment of business uncertainty and pessimism. Declining motor vehicle output held down overall industrial production, and the labor market weakened further. Consumer price inflation as measured by the core CPI decelerated over the past year, but steep increases in energy prices boosted overall price inflation.Private nonfarm payroll employment had fallen sharply on balance in recent months, though the quite large February decline may have been exaggerated by bad weather, military reserve call-ups, and seasonal adjustment difficulties. February job losses in manufacturing were at about the same pace as seen over the past year. However, layoffs in construction surged, likely reflecting the unusually adverse winter weather conditions over much of the country. There were widespread declines in employment in the service sector, particularly in industries that had experienced steady growth last year. Job losses in the transportation industry seemed to have been associated in part with higher fuel costs. The unemployment rate inched up to 5.8 percent in February, and the most recent readings on initial claims for unemployment insurance suggested that labor market conditions remained soft in March. Industrial production edged up in February after a sharp rise in January. Electricity generation increased substantially in response to unseasonably cold weather in much of the East, and mining production picked up. Manufacturing was pulled down in February by a slump in motor vehicle assemblies, but the output of high-tech goods registered another sizable gain, reflecting continuing growth in the production of semiconductors and computers, and output of goods other than motor vehicles and high-tech goods was unchanged. With manufacturing production lower, capacity utilization in manufacturing slipped somewhat in February to a rate substantially below its long-run average.Retail sales were lower on balance in January and February, partly reflecting a decline in motor vehicle sales in both months and snowstorms that kept many consumers at home in February. In addition, rising energy prices eroded part of the sluggish gains in consumer incomes, and both consumer sentiment and net worth deteriorated noticeably.With mortgage rates remaining near historical lows, strength in residential housing demand carried through the early part of this year. However, bad weather in February disrupted single-family construction activity and single-family starts fell sharply from January's very high level. Sales of both new and existing homes slipped noticeably in January but remained at elevated levels. In the multifamily sector, where vacancy rates are high and rents have fallen, starts dropped considerably to about the average pace recorded over the past three years.Business investment on equipment and software increased briskly in the fourth quarter of last year as outlays for aircraft climbed sharply and other major categories recorded gains. In January, a rise in shipments of nontransportation capital equipment suggested that the demand for such goods on the part of businesses was beginning to respond to continued increases in output and further declines in the cost of capital. In the high-tech sector, shipments of computing equipment surged in January, and shipments of communications equipment registered sizable gains. Outside  the high-tech sector, however, shipments edged down. Data on orders for durable equipment placed in December and January suggested that shipments could strengthen in the coming months. In the nonresidential sector, construction activity slowed further in the fourth quarter, with most categories recording sizable declines in expenditures. Many indicators of market conditions in the nonresidential sector continued to weaken, with vacancy rates rising and rents generally falling, but an upturn in property values suggested that a turnaround in rents might be near.The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles edged down in January following buildups of stocks in the third and fourth quarters of last year. The aggregate inventory-sales ratio for this sector had trended down from the high levels recorded in mid-2001 and reached a new low in January, with few imbalances evident across industries.The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed substantially in January as the value of exports partially reversed a large December decline and the value of imports fell from elevated November and December levels. The rise in exports and the drop in imports were broadly spread across goods categories. Available information on economic activity abroad indicated that most of the major foreign economies experienced sluggish growth late in 2002 that seemed likely to persist in the first quarter. Economic expansion in the euro area weakened further in the fourth quarter and Canadian output decelerated sharply, but growth in Japan was relatively well sustained at a modest pace. In the emerging-market economies, conditions in South America generally remained fragile, the pace of economic recovery in Mexico appeared to have slowed somewhat, and growth was generally restrained in much of emerging Asia. Economic growth in China remained strong.Most measures of core consumer prices and labor costs decelerated in the twelve-month period ended in January. However, the recent jump in gasoline and heating oil prices, reflecting a sharp run-up in crude oil prices and unusually cold weather in the Midwest and East, significantly boosted overall consumer price inflation in the twelve months ended in January. At the producer level, core price inflation for finished goods eased in the twelve-month interval ending in February. With regard to labor costs, hourly compensation for private industry workers decelerated noticeably in 2002, with growth of both the salary and benefits components slowing on a year-over-year basis. Growth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers also slowed in the twelve months ending in February. The deceleration in both labor measures likely reflected in part the slack in labor markets.At its meeting on January 28-29, 2003, the Committee agreed on a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-1/4 percent and retained a balanced risks assessment. The Committee noted that the economy continued to grow slowly, but monetary policy and financial conditions were quite accommodative and the prospects for an appreciable strengthening of the economic expansion over time remained favorable. The Committee concluded that a wait-and-see policy stance was desirable pending an improved basis for judging the ongoing performance of the economy. The Committee's decision was widely anticipated and elicited little reaction in financial markets. However, with the likelihood of war perceived to have increased, investor wariness apparently intensified downward pressure on equity prices and interest rates over the intermeeting period. Treasury bond yields declined somewhat, perhaps reflecting both expectations of lower policy rates and greater investor demands for safety. Rates in private debt markets fell by somewhat more than comparable-maturity Treasury yields. Declines in major equity indexes were amplified by lackluster earnings reports and disappointing data on auto sales, labor market conditions, and consumer confidence. The dollar changed little on balance over the intermeeting period in terms of an index of major foreign currencies, though the dollar fluctuated widely in the latter part of the period in reflection of market concerns about geopolitical uncertainties. The dollar depreciated against the Canadian dollar, which was supported by a small monetary tightening action by the Bank of Canada to trim inflationary pressures. By contrast, the dollar appreciated slightly against the British pound, partly in response to an unexpected easing by the Bank of England to counter downward pressures on economic activity. The European Central Bank also cut its key policy rates in response to further signs of economic weakness in major euro-area countries. The dollar was also little changed against an index of the currencies of other important U.S. trading partners. M2 grew rapidly in February, owing mainly to robust inflows to liquid deposits. Earlier filings for tax refunds and hefty mortgage prepayments associated with refinancing activity likely were factors in the strength of M2. In addition, investors might have seen liquid deposits as a safe haven at a time of considerable volatility in equity markets.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that economic expansion would be muted for a time. Faced with the likely onset of war in the very near term and the large uncertainties relating to its aftermath, businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending. In addition, continued sluggish economic growth among most major U.S. trading partners was expected to damp U.S. exports. Nonetheless, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time. The considerable monetary ease already in place and the likely prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus would combine with expected continuing strong gains in structural productivity and improving business and consumer confidence to provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to gradually boost business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to maintain some downward pressure on core price inflation over the forecast period.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that an unusually high degree of uncertainty had made it very difficult to assess the factors underlying the performance of the economy. Widespread indications of a strengthening economy near the end of last year through the first part of this year had given way to a disappointing economic performance more recently. It seemed clear that an outbreak of war with Iraq was imminent and that this prospect was having a damping effect on the economy. Uncertainty about the effects of the war had contributed to higher energy prices, lower equity prices, declines in measures of household confidence, and a tendency for households and especially businesses to postpone making commitments. But it was also possible that a part of the recent weakness might reflect underlying economic conditions. In the circumstances, some clarification of the Iraqi situation, which might occur in the relatively near future, should improve the Committee's ability to assess ongoing developments, though uncertainties would remain. Beyond the near term, members acknowledged that relatively subdued growth for a time could not be ruled out, but many commented that the conditions were in place for a strengthening expansion. In this regard they referred to the positive effects on business profits and consumer incomes of persisting gains in productivity, stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, and accommodative financial and bank lending markets. The likelihood of continued low or even declining inflation was high, especially given expectations of persisting slack in resource utilization.In the course of the Committee's review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members underscored the retarding effects of reduced confidence and heightened caution on household and business spending but noted that it was difficult to attribute the relative contributions of geopolitical risk and worries about the economy to the emergence of weaker spending. In any event, consumer expenditures appeared to have been held back recently by the impact of higher energy costs, weak labor markets, and severe winter weather in the eastern part of the United States. Sales of motor vehicles had declined substantially since the start of the year despite the introduction of enhanced sales incentives. Non-automotive retail sales, after a pickup at the end of 2002 that had extended through the first several weeks of this year, had weakened more recently. Whether the recent experience augured further softening in consumer spending was uncertain, but some members commented that this weak performance was not reassuring with regard to forecasts of substantial strengthening of the expansion later this year. Many observed, however, that a favorable outcome to the hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices in line with quotations in futures markets should generate a positive response in equity markets, boost consumer sentiment, and foster a rebound in consumer spending as the year progressed.    Housing activity had held up well on the whole, despite a negative report on housing starts for February, and indeed was displaying continued strength in many parts of the nation. In numerous areas, however, sales of high-end homes had continued to lag and there were reports of a softening in the middle-market single-family sector in some areas. Members also cited indications of overbuilding in some parts of the country, notably of multifamily housing. On balance, generally robust homebuilding activity was expected to persist against the backdrop of low mortgage interest rates and rising household incomes. With regard to the outlook for business capital expenditures, members commented that a variety of factors likely would induce business firms to continue to hold back on new investment initiatives, at least over the near term. Indeed, there was as yet no persuasive evidence that business fixed investment would provide the needed support for the strengthening in overall economic activity. Geopolitical uncertainties, notably those relating to developments in Iraq, frequently were cited by business contacts as a major reason for caution, but other factors inhibiting capital expenditures evidently included excess capacity and limited prospects for profits because of increased energy, insurance, pension, and other costs and a concomitant inability to raise selling prices.  At the same time, there was only limited evidence thus far that the partial-expensing tax incentive, scheduled to expire in September 2004, was having a measurable effect on outlays for new equipment and software. The outlook for commercial construction activity was especially downbeat because of high vacancy rates in industrial and office structures in many areas, and a general upturn in such construction was viewed as unlikely to occur for an extended period of time. While resolution of some of the uncertainties relating to Iraq seemed likely in the relatively near term, many business contacts reported that they would continue to hold down their capital investments until demand for their goods and services and related profit opportunities displayed clear signs of significant improvement. Some members nonetheless referred to indications of increasing expenditures for various categories of high-tech equipment and software, and they noted that impetus to demand from a positive outcome in the war against Iraq should have a favorable effect on business capital spending, especially if it were accompanied by a rally in the stock market. Many firms were trying to keep their inventories at especially low levels in light of their concerns that projected sales might not materialize. Members cited the resulting lean inventories as a positive element in the outlook for economic activity, given likely efforts by business firms to maintain inventories in broad aligment with anticipated growth over time in final sales. Federal government spending continued to rise rapidly, led by large increases in defense and homeland security expenditures, and members noted that the resulting impetus to growth might be augmented by passage of a fiscal stimulus package in line with that proposed by the Administration. Considerable uncertainty surrounded the eventual size of such a package or even whether it would be enacted this year. A partial offset to the federal fiscal stimulus stemmed from efforts to address deepening budget crises in a number of states and their adverse implications for many local economies.   Against the background of persistent strength in productivity growth and continued low levels of capital and labor utilization, inflation would likely remain subdued going forward. Indeed, members saw further disinflation in core prices as a distinct possibility over the next several quarters. At the same time, the outlook for oil prices and energy prices more generally was uncertain and, despite market expectations, oil prices might remain relatively high in the event of adverse developments in Iraq and in some other major oil producing countries that were experiencing serious economic and political problems. However, high oil prices, should they persist, were likely to have more of an effect in damping demand than in raising inflation, given well-entrenched expectations of low inflation.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members unanimously supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. While the economic expansion had displayed signs of faltering in recent weeks, the reasons for and hence the duration of any period of weakness could not be reliably ascertained. In that regard, members commented that as key geopolitical uncertainties diminished or were resolved, the Committee would be in a much better position to assess economic trends and a desirable course for monetary policy. Monetary policy was positioned to accommodate a strengthening economic performance that seemed likely to materialize once key uncertainties and related concerns began to decrease, perhaps in the relatively near future, and business and consumer sentiment started to improve. To be sure, the timing and speed of a pickup in economic activity were not clear, and some members saw continued growth below potential as the primary risk for the near term. The members concluded that the prudent course in current circumstances was to maintain a steady policy stance, a high degree of vigilance, and a readiness to respond promptly as needed to the emergence of clearer evidence relating to the performance of the economy. In the latter regard, some members cautioned that the Committee might well need to adjust its policy in circumstances that continued to be characterized by a substantial degree of uncertainty.The Committee decided to omit its usual statement regarding the balance of risks from the press release to be made public shortly after the meeting. Most members believed that the major uncertainties surrounding the geopolitical situation made it impossible to assign reasonable probabilities to plausible alternative economic outcomes and that any effort to do so would provide a misleading impression of the Committee's confidence and knowledge about the economic outlook. In light of these considerable uncertainties, the members agreed that heightened surveillance of evolving economic trends would be especially useful in the weeks ahead. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1-1/4 percent.Votes for this action:  Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, and Parry.    Votes against this action: None. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 6, 2003.   The meeting adjourned at 12:50 p.m. Following the outbreak of war in Iraq, the members of the Committee participated in a series of conference calls held on March 25, April 1, April 8, and April 16 in order to keep abreast of the latest information and to exchange views regarding the possible implications of current developments for the economic outlook and monetary policy. No policy decisions were made in this period. Vincent R.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.\\t\\tThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period January 29, 2003, through March 17, 2003. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity remained subpar in the opening months of the year. While the underlying demand for residential housing continued to be robust and government outlays evidently were rising, the expansion of consumer spending seemed to have slowed, and outlays for capital spending were still very sluggish in an environment of business uncertainty and pessimism. Declining motor vehicle output held down overall industrial production, and the labor market weakened further. Consumer price inflation as measured by the core CPI decelerated over the past year, but steep increases in energy prices boosted overall price inflation.Private nonfarm payroll employment had fallen sharply on balance in recent months, though the quite large February decline may have been exaggerated by bad weather, military reserve call-ups, and seasonal adjustment difficulties. February job losses in manufacturing were at about the same pace as seen over the past year. However, layoffs in construction surged, likely reflecting the unusually adverse winter weather conditions over much of the country. There were widespread declines in employment in the service sector, particularly in industries that had experienced steady growth last year. Job losses in the transportation industry seemed to have been associated in part with higher fuel costs. The unemployment rate inched up to 5.8 percent in February, and the most recent readings on initial claims for unemployment insurance suggested that labor market conditions remained soft in March. Industrial production edged up in February after a sharp rise in January. Electricity generation increased substantially in response to unseasonably cold weather in much of the East, and mining production picked up. Manufacturing was pulled down in February by a slump in motor vehicle assemblies, but the output of high-tech goods registered another sizable gain, reflecting continuing growth in the production of semiconductors and computers, and output of goods other than motor vehicles and high-tech goods was unchanged. With manufacturing production lower, capacity utilization in manufacturing slipped somewhat in February to a rate substantially below its long-run average.Retail sales were lower on balance in January and February, partly reflecting a decline in motor vehicle sales in both months and snowstorms that kept many consumers at home in February. In addition, rising energy prices eroded part of the sluggish gains in consumer incomes, and both consumer sentiment and net worth deteriorated noticeably.With mortgage rates remaining near historical lows, strength in residential housing demand carried through the early part of this year. However, bad weather in February disrupted single-family construction activity and single-family starts fell sharply from January's very high level. Sales of both new and existing homes slipped noticeably in January but remained at elevated levels. In the multifamily sector, where vacancy rates are high and rents have fallen, starts dropped considerably to about the average pace recorded over the past three years.Business investment on equipment and software increased briskly in the fourth quarter of last year as outlays for aircraft climbed sharply and other major categories recorded gains. In January, a rise in shipments of nontransportation capital equipment suggested that the demand for such goods on the part of businesses was beginning to respond to continued increases in output and further declines in the cost of capital. In the high-tech sector, shipments of computing equipment surged in January, and shipments of communications equipment registered sizable gains. Outside  the high-tech sector, however, shipments edged down. Data on orders for durable equipment placed in December and January suggested that shipments could strengthen in the coming months. In the nonresidential sector, construction activity slowed further in the fourth quarter, with most categories recording sizable declines in expenditures. Many indicators of market conditions in the nonresidential sector continued to weaken, with vacancy rates rising and rents generally falling, but an upturn in property values suggested that a turnaround in rents might be near.The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles edged down in January following buildups of stocks in the third and fourth quarters of last year. The aggregate inventory-sales ratio for this sector had trended down from the high levels recorded in mid-2001 and reached a new low in January, with few imbalances evident across industries.The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed substantially in January as the value of exports partially reversed a large December decline and the value of imports fell from elevated November and December levels. The rise in exports and the drop in imports were broadly spread across goods categories. Available information on economic activity abroad indicated that most of the major foreign economies experienced sluggish growth late in 2002 that seemed likely to persist in the first quarter. Economic expansion in the euro area weakened further in the fourth quarter and Canadian output decelerated sharply, but growth in Japan was relatively well sustained at a modest pace. In the emerging-market economies, conditions in South America generally remained fragile, the pace of economic recovery in Mexico appeared to have slowed somewhat, and growth was generally restrained in much of emerging Asia. Economic growth in China remained strong.Most measures of core consumer prices and labor costs decelerated in the twelve-month period ended in January. However, the recent jump in gasoline and heating oil prices, reflecting a sharp run-up in crude oil prices and unusually cold weather in the Midwest and East, significantly boosted overall consumer price inflation in the twelve months ended in January. At the producer level, core price inflation for finished goods eased in the twelve-month interval ending in February. With regard to labor costs, hourly compensation for private industry workers decelerated noticeably in 2002, with growth of both the salary and benefits components slowing on a year-over-year basis. Growth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers also slowed in the twelve months ending in February. The deceleration in both labor measures likely reflected in part the slack in labor markets.At its meeting on January 28-29, 2003, the Committee agreed on a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-1/4 percent and retained a balanced risks assessment. The Committee noted that the economy continued to grow slowly, but monetary policy and financial conditions were quite accommodative and the prospects for an appreciable strengthening of the economic expansion over time remained favorable. The Committee concluded that a wait-and-see policy stance was desirable pending an improved basis for judging the ongoing performance of the economy. The Committee's decision was widely anticipated and elicited little reaction in financial markets. However, with the likelihood of war perceived to have increased, investor wariness apparently intensified downward pressure on equity prices and interest rates over the intermeeting period. Treasury bond yields declined somewhat, perhaps reflecting both expectations of lower policy rates and greater investor demands for safety. Rates in private debt markets fell by somewhat more than comparable-maturity Treasury yields. Declines in major equity indexes were amplified by lackluster earnings reports and disappointing data on auto sales, labor market conditions, and consumer confidence. The dollar changed little on balance over the intermeeting period in terms of an index of major foreign currencies, though the dollar fluctuated widely in the latter part of the period in reflection of market concerns about geopolitical uncertainties. The dollar depreciated against the Canadian dollar, which was supported by a small monetary tightening action by the Bank of Canada to trim inflationary pressures. By contrast, the dollar appreciated slightly against the British pound, partly in response to an unexpected easing by the Bank of England to counter downward pressures on economic activity. The European Central Bank also cut its key policy rates in response to further signs of economic weakness in major euro-area countries. The dollar was also little changed against an index of the currencies of other important U.S. trading partners. M2 grew rapidly in February, owing mainly to robust inflows to liquid deposits. Earlier filings for tax refunds and hefty mortgage prepayments associated with refinancing activity likely were factors in the strength of M2. In addition, investors might have seen liquid deposits as a safe haven at a time of considerable volatility in equity markets.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that economic expansion would be muted for a time. Faced with the likely onset of war in the very near term and the large uncertainties relating to its aftermath, businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending. In addition, continued sluggish economic growth among most major U.S. trading partners was expected to damp U.S. exports. Nonetheless, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time. The considerable monetary ease already in place and the likely prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus would combine with expected continuing strong gains in structural productivity and improving business and consumer confidence to provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to gradually boost business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to maintain some downward pressure on core price inflation over the forecast period.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that an unusually high degree of uncertainty had made it very difficult to assess the factors underlying the performance of the economy. Widespread indications of a strengthening economy near the end of last year through the first part of this year had given way to a disappointing economic performance more recently. It seemed clear that an outbreak of war with Iraq was imminent and that this prospect was having a damping effect on the economy. Uncertainty about the effects of the war had contributed to higher energy prices, lower equity prices, declines in measures of household confidence, and a tendency for households and especially businesses to postpone making commitments. But it was also possible that a part of the recent weakness might reflect underlying economic conditions. In the circumstances, some clarification of the Iraqi situation, which might occur in the relatively near future, should improve the Committee's ability to assess ongoing developments, though uncertainties would remain. Beyond the near term, members acknowledged that relatively subdued growth for a time could not be ruled out, but many commented that the conditions were in place for a strengthening expansion. In this regard they referred to the positive effects on business profits and consumer incomes of persisting gains in productivity, stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, and accommodative financial and bank lending markets. The likelihood of continued low or even declining inflation was high, especially given expectations of persisting slack in resource utilization.In the course of the Committee's review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members underscored the retarding effects of reduced confidence and heightened caution on household and business spending but noted that it was difficult to attribute the relative contributions of geopolitical risk and worries about the economy to the emergence of weaker spending. In any event, consumer expenditures appeared to have been held back recently by the impact of higher energy costs, weak labor markets, and severe winter weather in the eastern part of the United States. Sales of motor vehicles had declined substantially since the start of the year despite the introduction of enhanced sales incentives. Non-automotive retail sales, after a pickup at the end of 2002 that had extended through the first several weeks of this year, had weakened more recently. Whether the recent experience augured further softening in consumer spending was uncertain, but some members commented that this weak performance was not reassuring with regard to forecasts of substantial strengthening of the expansion later this year. Many observed, however, that a favorable outcome to the hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices in line with quotations in futures markets should generate a positive response in equity markets, boost consumer sentiment, and foster a rebound in consumer spending as the year progressed.    Housing activity had held up well on the whole, despite a negative report on housing starts for February, and indeed was displaying continued strength in many parts of the nation. In numerous areas, however, sales of high-end homes had continued to lag and there were reports of a softening in the middle-market single-family sector in some areas. Members also cited indications of overbuilding in some parts of the country, notably of multifamily housing. On balance, generally robust homebuilding activity was expected to persist against the backdrop of low mortgage interest rates and rising household incomes. With regard to the outlook for business capital expenditures, members commented that a variety of factors likely would induce business firms to continue to hold back on new investment initiatives, at least over the near term. Indeed, there was as yet no persuasive evidence that business fixed investment would provide the needed support for the strengthening in overall economic activity. Geopolitical uncertainties, notably those relating to developments in Iraq, frequently were cited by business contacts as a major reason for caution, but other factors inhibiting capital expenditures evidently included excess capacity and limited prospects for profits because of increased energy, insurance, pension, and other costs and a concomitant inability to raise selling prices.  At the same time, there was only limited evidence thus far that the partial-expensing tax incentive, scheduled to expire in September 2004, was having a measurable effect on outlays for new equipment and software. The outlook for commercial construction activity was especially downbeat because of high vacancy rates in industrial and office structures in many areas, and a general upturn in such construction was viewed as unlikely to occur for an extended period of time. While resolution of some of the uncertainties relating to Iraq seemed likely in the relatively near term, many business contacts reported that they would continue to hold down their capital investments until demand for their goods and services and related profit opportunities displayed clear signs of significant improvement. Some members nonetheless referred to indications of increasing expenditures for various categories of high-tech equipment and software, and they noted that impetus to demand from a positive outcome in the war against Iraq should have a favorable effect on business capital spending, especially if it were accompanied by a rally in the stock market. Many firms were trying to keep their inventories at especially low levels in light of their concerns that projected sales might not materialize. Members cited the resulting lean inventories as a positive element in the outlook for economic activity, given likely efforts by business firms to maintain inventories in broad aligment with anticipated growth over time in final sales. Federal government spending continued to rise rapidly, led by large increases in defense and homeland security expenditures, and members noted that the resulting impetus to growth might be augmented by passage of a fiscal stimulus package in line with that proposed by the Administration. Considerable uncertainty surrounded the eventual size of such a package or even whether it would be enacted this year. A partial offset to the federal fiscal stimulus stemmed from efforts to address deepening budget crises in a number of states and their adverse implications for many local economies.   Against the background of persistent strength in productivity growth and continued low levels of capital and labor utilization, inflation would likely remain subdued going forward. Indeed, members saw further disinflation in core prices as a distinct possibility over the next several quarters. At the same time, the outlook for oil prices and energy prices more generally was uncertain and, despite market expectations, oil prices might remain relatively high in the event of adverse developments in Iraq and in some other major oil producing countries that were experiencing serious economic and political problems. However, high oil prices, should they persist, were likely to have more of an effect in damping demand than in raising inflation, given well-entrenched expectations of low inflation.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members unanimously supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. While the economic expansion had displayed signs of faltering in recent weeks, the reasons for and hence the duration of any period of weakness could not be reliably ascertained. In that regard, members commented that as key geopolitical uncertainties diminished or were resolved, the Committee would be in a much better position to assess economic trends and a desirable course for monetary policy. Monetary policy was positioned to accommodate a strengthening economic performance that seemed likely to materialize once key uncertainties and related concerns began to decrease, perhaps in the relatively near future, and business and consumer sentiment started to improve. To be sure, the timing and speed of a pickup in economic activity were not clear, and some members saw continued growth below potential as the primary risk for the near term. The members concluded that the prudent course in current circumstances was to maintain a steady policy stance, a high degree of vigilance, and a readiness to respond promptly as needed to the emergence of clearer evidence relating to the performance of the economy. In the latter regard, some members cautioned that the Committee might well need to adjust its policy in circumstances that continued to be characterized by a substantial degree of uncertainty.The Committee decided to omit its usual statement regarding the balance of risks from the press release to be made public shortly after the meeting. Most members believed that the major uncertainties surrounding the geopolitical situation made it impossible to assign reasonable probabilities to plausible alternative economic outcomes and that any effort to do so would provide a misleading impression of the Committee's confidence and knowledge about the economic outlook. In light of these considerable uncertainties, the members agreed that heightened surveillance of evolving economic trends would be especially useful in the weeks ahead. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1-1/4 percent.Votes for this action:  Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, and Parry.    Votes against this action: None. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 6, 2003.   The meeting adjourned at 12:50 p.m. Following the outbreak of war in Iraq, the members of the Committee participated in a series of conference calls held on March 25, April 1, April 8, and April 16 in order to keep abreast of the latest information and to exchange views regarding the possible implications of current developments for the economic outlook and monetary policy. No policy decisions were made in this period. Vincent R.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.\\t\\tThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period January 29, 2003, through March 17, 2003. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity remained subpar in the opening months of the year. While the underlying demand for residential housing continued to be robust and government outlays evidently were rising, the expansion of consumer spending seemed to have slowed, and outlays for capital spending were still very sluggish in an environment of business uncertainty and pessimism. Declining motor vehicle output held down overall industrial production, and the labor market weakened further. Consumer price inflation as measured by the core CPI decelerated over the past year, but steep increases in energy prices boosted overall price inflation.Private nonfarm payroll employment had fallen sharply on balance in recent months, though the quite large February decline may have been exaggerated by bad weather, military reserve call-ups, and seasonal adjustment difficulties. February job losses in manufacturing were at about the same pace as seen over the past year. However, layoffs in construction surged, likely reflecting the unusually adverse winter weather conditions over much of the country. There were widespread declines in employment in the service sector, particularly in industries that had experienced steady growth last year. Job losses in the transportation industry seemed to have been associated in part with higher fuel costs. The unemployment rate inched up to 5.8 percent in February, and the most recent readings on initial claims for unemployment insurance suggested that labor market conditions remained soft in March. Industrial production edged up in February after a sharp rise in January. Electricity generation increased substantially in response to unseasonably cold weather in much of the East, and mining production picked up. Manufacturing was pulled down in February by a slump in motor vehicle assemblies, but the output of high-tech goods registered another sizable gain, reflecting continuing growth in the production of semiconductors and computers, and output of goods other than motor vehicles and high-tech goods was unchanged. With manufacturing production lower, capacity utilization in manufacturing slipped somewhat in February to a rate substantially below its long-run average.Retail sales were lower on balance in January and February, partly reflecting a decline in motor vehicle sales in both months and snowstorms that kept many consumers at home in February. In addition, rising energy prices eroded part of the sluggish gains in consumer incomes, and both consumer sentiment and net worth deteriorated noticeably.With mortgage rates remaining near historical lows, strength in residential housing demand carried through the early part of this year. However, bad weather in February disrupted single-family construction activity and single-family starts fell sharply from January's very high level. Sales of both new and existing homes slipped noticeably in January but remained at elevated levels. In the multifamily sector, where vacancy rates are high and rents have fallen, starts dropped considerably to about the average pace recorded over the past three years.Business investment on equipment and software increased briskly in the fourth quarter of last year as outlays for aircraft climbed sharply and other major categories recorded gains. In January, a rise in shipments of nontransportation capital equipment suggested that the demand for such goods on the part of businesses was beginning to respond to continued increases in output and further declines in the cost of capital. In the high-tech sector, shipments of computing equipment surged in January, and shipments of communications equipment registered sizable gains. Outside  the high-tech sector, however, shipments edged down. Data on orders for durable equipment placed in December and January suggested that shipments could strengthen in the coming months. In the nonresidential sector, construction activity slowed further in the fourth quarter, with most categories recording sizable declines in expenditures. Many indicators of market conditions in the nonresidential sector continued to weaken, with vacancy rates rising and rents generally falling, but an upturn in property values suggested that a turnaround in rents might be near.The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles edged down in January following buildups of stocks in the third and fourth quarters of last year. The aggregate inventory-sales ratio for this sector had trended down from the high levels recorded in mid-2001 and reached a new low in January, with few imbalances evident across industries.The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed substantially in January as the value of exports partially reversed a large December decline and the value of imports fell from elevated November and December levels. The rise in exports and the drop in imports were broadly spread across goods categories. Available information on economic activity abroad indicated that most of the major foreign economies experienced sluggish growth late in 2002 that seemed likely to persist in the first quarter. Economic expansion in the euro area weakened further in the fourth quarter and Canadian output decelerated sharply, but growth in Japan was relatively well sustained at a modest pace. In the emerging-market economies, conditions in South America generally remained fragile, the pace of economic recovery in Mexico appeared to have slowed somewhat, and growth was generally restrained in much of emerging Asia. Economic growth in China remained strong.Most measures of core consumer prices and labor costs decelerated in the twelve-month period ended in January. However, the recent jump in gasoline and heating oil prices, reflecting a sharp run-up in crude oil prices and unusually cold weather in the Midwest and East, significantly boosted overall consumer price inflation in the twelve months ended in January. At the producer level, core price inflation for finished goods eased in the twelve-month interval ending in February. With regard to labor costs, hourly compensation for private industry workers decelerated noticeably in 2002, with growth of both the salary and benefits components slowing on a year-over-year basis. Growth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers also slowed in the twelve months ending in February. The deceleration in both labor measures likely reflected in part the slack in labor markets.At its meeting on January 28-29, 2003, the Committee agreed on a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-1/4 percent and retained a balanced risks assessment. The Committee noted that the economy continued to grow slowly, but monetary policy and financial conditions were quite accommodative and the prospects for an appreciable strengthening of the economic expansion over time remained favorable. The Committee concluded that a wait-and-see policy stance was desirable pending an improved basis for judging the ongoing performance of the economy. The Committee's decision was widely anticipated and elicited little reaction in financial markets. However, with the likelihood of war perceived to have increased, investor wariness apparently intensified downward pressure on equity prices and interest rates over the intermeeting period. Treasury bond yields declined somewhat, perhaps reflecting both expectations of lower policy rates and greater investor demands for safety. Rates in private debt markets fell by somewhat more than comparable-maturity Treasury yields. Declines in major equity indexes were amplified by lackluster earnings reports and disappointing data on auto sales, labor market conditions, and consumer confidence. The dollar changed little on balance over the intermeeting period in terms of an index of major foreign currencies, though the dollar fluctuated widely in the latter part of the period in reflection of market concerns about geopolitical uncertainties. The dollar depreciated against the Canadian dollar, which was supported by a small monetary tightening action by the Bank of Canada to trim inflationary pressures. By contrast, the dollar appreciated slightly against the British pound, partly in response to an unexpected easing by the Bank of England to counter downward pressures on economic activity. The European Central Bank also cut its key policy rates in response to further signs of economic weakness in major euro-area countries. The dollar was also little changed against an index of the currencies of other important U.S. trading partners. M2 grew rapidly in February, owing mainly to robust inflows to liquid deposits. Earlier filings for tax refunds and hefty mortgage prepayments associated with refinancing activity likely were factors in the strength of M2. In addition, investors might have seen liquid deposits as a safe haven at a time of considerable volatility in equity markets.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that economic expansion would be muted for a time. Faced with the likely onset of war in the very near term and the large uncertainties relating to its aftermath, businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending. In addition, continued sluggish economic growth among most major U.S. trading partners was expected to damp U.S. exports. Nonetheless, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time.

Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to gradually boost business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to maintain some downward pressure on core price inflation over the forecast period.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that an unusually high degree of uncertainty had made it very difficult to assess the factors underlying the performance of the economy. Widespread indications of a strengthening economy near the end of last year through the first part of this year had given way to a disappointing economic performance more recently. It seemed clear that an outbreak of war with Iraq was imminent and that this prospect was having a damping effect on the economy. Uncertainty about the effects of the war had contributed to higher energy prices, lower equity prices, declines in measures of household confidence, and a tendency for households and especially businesses to postpone making commitments. But it was also possible that a part of the recent weakness might reflect underlying economic conditions. In the circumstances, some clarification of the Iraqi situation, which might occur in the relatively near future, should improve the Committee's ability to assess ongoing developments, though uncertainties would remain. Beyond the near term, members acknowledged that relatively subdued growth for a time could not be ruled out, but many commented that the conditions were in place for a strengthening expansion. In this regard they referred to the positive effects on business profits and consumer incomes of persisting gains in productivity, stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, and accommodative financial and bank lending markets. The likelihood of continued low or even declining inflation was high, especially given expectations of persisting slack in resource utilization.In the course of the Committee's review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members underscored the retarding effects of reduced confidence and heightened caution on household and business spending but noted that it was difficult to attribute the relative contributions of geopolitical risk and worries about the economy to the emergence of weaker spending.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.\\t\\tThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period January 29, 2003, through March 17, 2003. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity remained subpar in the opening months of the year. While the underlying demand for residential housing continued to be robust and government outlays evidently were rising, the expansion of consumer spending seemed to have slowed, and outlays for capital spending were still very sluggish in an environment of business uncertainty and pessimism. Declining motor vehicle output held down overall industrial production, and the labor market weakened further. Consumer price inflation as measured by the core CPI decelerated over the past year, but steep increases in energy prices boosted overall price inflation.Private nonfarm payroll employment had fallen sharply on balance in recent months, though the quite large February decline may have been exaggerated by bad weather, military reserve call-ups, and seasonal adjustment difficulties. February job losses in manufacturing were at about the same pace as seen over the past year. However, layoffs in construction surged, likely reflecting the unusually adverse winter weather conditions over much of the country. There were widespread declines in employment in the service sector, particularly in industries that had experienced steady growth last year. Job losses in the transportation industry seemed to have been associated in part with higher fuel costs. The unemployment rate inched up to 5.8 percent in February, and the most recent readings on initial claims for unemployment insurance suggested that labor market conditions remained soft in March. Industrial production edged up in February after a sharp rise in January. Electricity generation increased substantially in response to unseasonably cold weather in much of the East, and mining production picked up. Manufacturing was pulled down in February by a slump in motor vehicle assemblies, but the output of high-tech goods registered another sizable gain, reflecting continuing growth in the production of semiconductors and computers, and output of goods other than motor vehicles and high-tech goods was unchanged. With manufacturing production lower, capacity utilization in manufacturing slipped somewhat in February to a rate substantially below its long-run average.Retail sales were lower on balance in January and February, partly reflecting a decline in motor vehicle sales in both months and snowstorms that kept many consumers at home in February. In addition, rising energy prices eroded part of the sluggish gains in consumer incomes, and both consumer sentiment and net worth deteriorated noticeably.With mortgage rates remaining near historical lows, strength in residential housing demand carried through the early part of this year. However, bad weather in February disrupted single-family construction activity and single-family starts fell sharply from January's very high level. Sales of both new and existing homes slipped noticeably in January but remained at elevated levels. In the multifamily sector, where vacancy rates are high and rents have fallen, starts dropped considerably to about the average pace recorded over the past three years.Business investment on equipment and software increased briskly in the fourth quarter of last year as outlays for aircraft climbed sharply and other major categories recorded gains. In January, a rise in shipments of nontransportation capital equipment suggested that the demand for such goods on the part of businesses was beginning to respond to continued increases in output and further declines in the cost of capital. In the high-tech sector, shipments of computing equipment surged in January, and shipments of communications equipment registered sizable gains. Outside  the high-tech sector, however, shipments edged down. Data on orders for durable equipment placed in December and January suggested that shipments could strengthen in the coming months. In the nonresidential sector, construction activity slowed further in the fourth quarter, with most categories recording sizable declines in expenditures. Many indicators of market conditions in the nonresidential sector continued to weaken, with vacancy rates rising and rents generally falling, but an upturn in property values suggested that a turnaround in rents might be near.The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles edged down in January following buildups of stocks in the third and fourth quarters of last year. The aggregate inventory-sales ratio for this sector had trended down from the high levels recorded in mid-2001 and reached a new low in January, with few imbalances evident across industries.The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed substantially in January as the value of exports partially reversed a large December decline and the value of imports fell from elevated November and December levels. The rise in exports and the drop in imports were broadly spread across goods categories. Available information on economic activity abroad indicated that most of the major foreign economies experienced sluggish growth late in 2002 that seemed likely to persist in the first quarter. Economic expansion in the euro area weakened further in the fourth quarter and Canadian output decelerated sharply, but growth in Japan was relatively well sustained at a modest pace. In the emerging-market economies, conditions in South America generally remained fragile, the pace of economic recovery in Mexico appeared to have slowed somewhat, and growth was generally restrained in much of emerging Asia. Economic growth in China remained strong.Most measures of core consumer prices and labor costs decelerated in the twelve-month period ended in January. However, the recent jump in gasoline and heating oil prices, reflecting a sharp run-up in crude oil prices and unusually cold weather in the Midwest and East, significantly boosted overall consumer price inflation in the twelve months ended in January. At the producer level, core price inflation for finished goods eased in the twelve-month interval ending in February. With regard to labor costs, hourly compensation for private industry workers decelerated noticeably in 2002, with growth of both the salary and benefits components slowing on a year-over-year basis. Growth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers also slowed in the twelve months ending in February. The deceleration in both labor measures likely reflected in part the slack in labor markets.At its meeting on January 28-29, 2003, the Committee agreed on a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-1/4 percent and retained a balanced risks assessment. The Committee noted that the economy continued to grow slowly, but monetary policy and financial conditions were quite accommodative and the prospects for an appreciable strengthening of the economic expansion over time remained favorable. The Committee concluded that a wait-and-see policy stance was desirable pending an improved basis for judging the ongoing performance of the economy. The Committee's decision was widely anticipated and elicited little reaction in financial markets. However, with the likelihood of war perceived to have increased, investor wariness apparently intensified downward pressure on equity prices and interest rates over the intermeeting period. Treasury bond yields declined somewhat, perhaps reflecting both expectations of lower policy rates and greater investor demands for safety. Rates in private debt markets fell by somewhat more than comparable-maturity Treasury yields. Declines in major equity indexes were amplified by lackluster earnings reports and disappointing data on auto sales, labor market conditions, and consumer confidence. The dollar changed little on balance over the intermeeting period in terms of an index of major foreign currencies, though the dollar fluctuated widely in the latter part of the period in reflection of market concerns about geopolitical uncertainties. The dollar depreciated against the Canadian dollar, which was supported by a small monetary tightening action by the Bank of Canada to trim inflationary pressures. By contrast, the dollar appreciated slightly against the British pound, partly in response to an unexpected easing by the Bank of England to counter downward pressures on economic activity. The European Central Bank also cut its key policy rates in response to further signs of economic weakness in major euro-area countries. The dollar was also little changed against an index of the currencies of other important U.S. trading partners. M2 grew rapidly in February, owing mainly to robust inflows to liquid deposits. Earlier filings for tax refunds and hefty mortgage prepayments associated with refinancing activity likely were factors in the strength of M2. In addition, investors might have seen liquid deposits as a safe haven at a time of considerable volatility in equity markets.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that economic expansion would be muted for a time. Faced with the likely onset of war in the very near term and the large uncertainties relating to its aftermath, businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending. In addition, continued sluggish economic growth among most major U.S. trading partners was expected to damp U.S. exports. Nonetheless, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time. The considerable monetary ease already in place and the likely prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus would combine with expected continuing strong gains in structural productivity and improving business and consumer confidence to provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to gradually boost business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to maintain some downward pressure on core price inflation over the forecast period.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that an unusually high degree of uncertainty had made it very difficult to assess the factors underlying the performance of the economy. Widespread indications of a strengthening economy near the end of last year through the first part of this year had given way to a disappointing economic performance more recently. It seemed clear that an outbreak of war with Iraq was imminent and that this prospect was having a damping effect on the economy. Uncertainty about the effects of the war had contributed to higher energy prices, lower equity prices, declines in measures of household confidence, and a tendency for households and especially businesses to postpone making commitments. But it was also possible that a part of the recent weakness might reflect underlying economic conditions. In the circumstances, some clarification of the Iraqi situation, which might occur in the relatively near future, should improve the Committee's ability to assess ongoing developments, though uncertainties would remain. Beyond the near term, members acknowledged that relatively subdued growth for a time could not be ruled out, but many commented that the conditions were in place for a strengthening expansion. In this regard they referred to the positive effects on business profits and consumer incomes of persisting gains in productivity, stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, and accommodative financial and bank lending markets. The likelihood of continued low or even declining inflation was high, especially given expectations of persisting slack in resource utilization.In the course of the Committee's review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members underscored the retarding effects of reduced confidence and heightened caution on household and business spending but noted that it was difficult to attribute the relative contributions of geopolitical risk and worries about the economy to the emergence of weaker spending. In any event, consumer expenditures appeared to have been held back recently by the impact of higher energy costs, weak labor markets, and severe winter weather in the eastern part of the United States. Sales of motor vehicles had declined substantially since the start of the year despite the introduction of enhanced sales incentives. Non-automotive retail sales, after a pickup at the end of 2002 that had extended through the first several weeks of this year, had weakened more recently. Whether the recent experience augured further softening in consumer spending was uncertain, but some members commented that this weak performance was not reassuring with regard to forecasts of substantial strengthening of the expansion later this year. Many observed, however, that a favorable outcome to the hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices in line with quotations in futures markets should generate a positive response in equity markets, boost consumer sentiment, and foster a rebound in consumer spending as the year progressed.    Housing activity had held up well on the whole, despite a negative report on housing starts for February, and indeed was displaying continued strength in many parts of the nation. In numerous areas, however, sales of high-end homes had continued to lag and there were reports of a softening in the middle-market single-family sector in some areas. Members also cited indications of overbuilding in some parts of the country, notably of multifamily housing. On balance, generally robust homebuilding activity was expected to persist against the backdrop of low mortgage interest rates and rising household incomes. With regard to the outlook for business capital expenditures, members commented that a variety of factors likely would induce business firms to continue to hold back on new investment initiatives, at least over the near term. Indeed, there was as yet no persuasive evidence that business fixed investment would provide the needed support for the strengthening in overall economic activity. Geopolitical uncertainties, notably those relating to developments in Iraq, frequently were cited by business contacts as a major reason for caution, but other factors inhibiting capital expenditures evidently included excess capacity and limited prospects for profits because of increased energy, insurance, pension, and other costs and a concomitant inability to raise selling prices.  At the same time, there was only limited evidence thus far that the partial-expensing tax incentive, scheduled to expire in September 2004, was having a measurable effect on outlays for new equipment and software. The outlook for commercial construction activity was especially downbeat because of high vacancy rates in industrial and office structures in many areas, and a general upturn in such construction was viewed as unlikely to occur for an extended period of time. While resolution of some of the uncertainties relating to Iraq seemed likely in the relatively near term, many business contacts reported that they would continue to hold down their capital investments until demand for their goods and services and related profit opportunities displayed clear signs of significant improvement. Some members nonetheless referred to indications of increasing expenditures for various categories of high-tech equipment and software, and they noted that impetus to demand from a positive outcome in the war against Iraq should have a favorable effect on business capital spending, especially if it were accompanied by a rally in the stock market. Many firms were trying to keep their inventories at especially low levels in light of their concerns that projected sales might not materialize. Members cited the resulting lean inventories as a positive element in the outlook for economic activity, given likely efforts by business firms to maintain inventories in broad aligment with anticipated growth over time in final sales. Federal government spending continued to rise rapidly, led by large increases in defense and homeland security expenditures, and members noted that the resulting impetus to growth might be augmented by passage of a fiscal stimulus package in line with that proposed by the Administration. Considerable uncertainty surrounded the eventual size of such a package or even whether it would be enacted this year. A partial offset to the federal fiscal stimulus stemmed from efforts to address deepening budget crises in a number of states and their adverse implications for many local economies.   Against the background of persistent strength in productivity growth and continued low levels of capital and labor utilization, inflation would likely remain subdued going forward. Indeed, members saw further disinflation in core prices as a distinct possibility over the next several quarters. At the same time, the outlook for oil prices and energy prices more generally was uncertain and, despite market expectations, oil prices might remain relatively high in the event of adverse developments in Iraq and in some other major oil producing countries that were experiencing serious economic and political problems. However, high oil prices, should they persist, were likely to have more of an effect in damping demand than in raising inflation, given well-entrenched expectations of low inflation.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members unanimously supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. While the economic expansion had displayed signs of faltering in recent weeks, the reasons for and hence the duration of any period of weakness could not be reliably ascertained. In that regard, members commented that as key geopolitical uncertainties diminished or were resolved, the Committee would be in a much better position to assess economic trends and a desirable course for monetary policy. Monetary policy was positioned to accommodate a strengthening economic performance that seemed likely to materialize once key uncertainties and related concerns began to decrease, perhaps in the relatively near future, and business and consumer sentiment started to improve. To be sure, the timing and speed of a pickup in economic activity were not clear, and some members saw continued growth below potential as the primary risk for the near term. The members concluded that the prudent course in current circumstances was to maintain a steady policy stance, a high degree of vigilance, and a readiness to respond promptly as needed to the emergence of clearer evidence relating to the performance of the economy. In the latter regard, some members cautioned that the Committee might well need to adjust its policy in circumstances that continued to be characterized by a substantial degree of uncertainty.The Committee decided to omit its usual statement regarding the balance of risks from the press release to be made public shortly after the meeting. Most members believed that the major uncertainties surrounding the geopolitical situation made it impossible to assign reasonable probabilities to plausible alternative economic outcomes and that any effort to do so would provide a misleading impression of the Committee's confidence and knowledge about the economic outlook. In light of these considerable uncertainties, the members agreed that heightened surveillance of evolving economic trends would be especially useful in the weeks ahead. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1-1/4 percent.Votes for this action:  Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, and Parry.    Votes against this action: None. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 6, 2003.   The meeting adjourned at 12:50 p.m. Following the outbreak of war in Iraq, the members of the Committee participated in a series of conference calls held on March 25, April 1, April 8, and April 16 in order to keep abreast of the latest information and to exchange views regarding the possible implications of current developments for the economic outlook and monetary policy. No policy decisions were made in this period. Vincent R.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.\\t\\tThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period January 29, 2003, through March 17, 2003. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that growth of economic activity remained subpar in the opening months of the year. While the underlying demand for residential housing continued to be robust and government outlays evidently were rising, the expansion of consumer spending seemed to have slowed, and outlays for capital spending were still very sluggish in an environment of business uncertainty and pessimism. Declining motor vehicle output held down overall industrial production, and the labor market weakened further. Consumer price inflation as measured by the core CPI decelerated over the past year, but steep increases in energy prices boosted overall price inflation.Private nonfarm payroll employment had fallen sharply on balance in recent months, though the quite large February decline may have been exaggerated by bad weather, military reserve call-ups, and seasonal adjustment difficulties. February job losses in manufacturing were at about the same pace as seen over the past year. However, layoffs in construction surged, likely reflecting the unusually adverse winter weather conditions over much of the country. There were widespread declines in employment in the service sector, particularly in industries that had experienced steady growth last year. Job losses in the transportation industry seemed to have been associated in part with higher fuel costs. The unemployment rate inched up to 5.8 percent in February, and the most recent readings on initial claims for unemployment insurance suggested that labor market conditions remained soft in March. Industrial production edged up in February after a sharp rise in January. Electricity generation increased substantially in response to unseasonably cold weather in much of the East, and mining production picked up. Manufacturing was pulled down in February by a slump in motor vehicle assemblies, but the output of high-tech goods registered another sizable gain, reflecting continuing growth in the production of semiconductors and computers, and output of goods other than motor vehicles and high-tech goods was unchanged. With manufacturing production lower, capacity utilization in manufacturing slipped somewhat in February to a rate substantially below its long-run average.Retail sales were lower on balance in January and February, partly reflecting a decline in motor vehicle sales in both months and snowstorms that kept many consumers at home in February. In addition, rising energy prices eroded part of the sluggish gains in consumer incomes, and both consumer sentiment and net worth deteriorated noticeably.With mortgage rates remaining near historical lows, strength in residential housing demand carried through the early part of this year. However, bad weather in February disrupted single-family construction activity and single-family starts fell sharply from January's very high level. Sales of both new and existing homes slipped noticeably in January but remained at elevated levels. In the multifamily sector, where vacancy rates are high and rents have fallen, starts dropped considerably to about the average pace recorded over the past three years.Business investment on equipment and software increased briskly in the fourth quarter of last year as outlays for aircraft climbed sharply and other major categories recorded gains. In January, a rise in shipments of nontransportation capital equipment suggested that the demand for such goods on the part of businesses was beginning to respond to continued increases in output and further declines in the cost of capital. In the high-tech sector, shipments of computing equipment surged in January, and shipments of communications equipment registered sizable gains. Outside  the high-tech sector, however, shipments edged down. Data on orders for durable equipment placed in December and January suggested that shipments could strengthen in the coming months. In the nonresidential sector, construction activity slowed further in the fourth quarter, with most categories recording sizable declines in expenditures. Many indicators of market conditions in the nonresidential sector continued to weaken, with vacancy rates rising and rents generally falling, but an upturn in property values suggested that a turnaround in rents might be near.The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles edged down in January following buildups of stocks in the third and fourth quarters of last year. The aggregate inventory-sales ratio for this sector had trended down from the high levels recorded in mid-2001 and reached a new low in January, with few imbalances evident across industries.The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed substantially in January as the value of exports partially reversed a large December decline and the value of imports fell from elevated November and December levels. The rise in exports and the drop in imports were broadly spread across goods categories. Available information on economic activity abroad indicated that most of the major foreign economies experienced sluggish growth late in 2002 that seemed likely to persist in the first quarter. Economic expansion in the euro area weakened further in the fourth quarter and Canadian output decelerated sharply, but growth in Japan was relatively well sustained at a modest pace. In the emerging-market economies, conditions in South America generally remained fragile, the pace of economic recovery in Mexico appeared to have slowed somewhat, and growth was generally restrained in much of emerging Asia. Economic growth in China remained strong.Most measures of core consumer prices and labor costs decelerated in the twelve-month period ended in January. However, the recent jump in gasoline and heating oil prices, reflecting a sharp run-up in crude oil prices and unusually cold weather in the Midwest and East, significantly boosted overall consumer price inflation in the twelve months ended in January. At the producer level, core price inflation for finished goods eased in the twelve-month interval ending in February. With regard to labor costs, hourly compensation for private industry workers decelerated noticeably in 2002, with growth of both the salary and benefits components slowing on a year-over-year basis. Growth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers also slowed in the twelve months ending in February. The deceleration in both labor measures likely reflected in part the slack in labor markets.At its meeting on January 28-29, 2003, the Committee agreed on a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-1/4 percent and retained a balanced risks assessment. The Committee noted that the economy continued to grow slowly, but monetary policy and financial conditions were quite accommodative and the prospects for an appreciable strengthening of the economic expansion over time remained favorable. The Committee concluded that a wait-and-see policy stance was desirable pending an improved basis for judging the ongoing performance of the economy. The Committee's decision was widely anticipated and elicited little reaction in financial markets. However, with the likelihood of war perceived to have increased, investor wariness apparently intensified downward pressure on equity prices and interest rates over the intermeeting period. Treasury bond yields declined somewhat, perhaps reflecting both expectations of lower policy rates and greater investor demands for safety. Rates in private debt markets fell by somewhat more than comparable-maturity Treasury yields. Declines in major equity indexes were amplified by lackluster earnings reports and disappointing data on auto sales, labor market conditions, and consumer confidence.

The European Central Bank also cut its key policy rates in response to further signs of economic weakness in major euro-area countries. The dollar was also little changed against an index of the currencies of other important U.S. trading partners. M2 grew rapidly in February, owing mainly to robust inflows to liquid deposits. Earlier filings for tax refunds and hefty mortgage prepayments associated with refinancing activity likely were factors in the strength of M2. In addition, investors might have seen liquid deposits as a safe haven at a time of considerable volatility in equity markets.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that economic expansion would be muted for a time. Faced with the likely onset of war in the very near term and the large uncertainties relating to its aftermath, businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending. In addition, continued sluggish economic growth among most major U.S. trading partners was expected to damp U.S. exports. Nonetheless, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time. The considerable monetary ease already in place and the likely prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus would combine with expected continuing strong gains in structural productivity and improving business and consumer confidence to provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to gradually boost business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to maintain some downward pressure on core price inflation over the forecast period.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that an unusually high degree of uncertainty had made it very difficult to assess the factors underlying the performance of the economy. Widespread indications of a strengthening economy near the end of last year through the first part of this year had given way to a disappointing economic performance more recently. It seemed clear that an outbreak of war with Iraq was imminent and that this prospect was having a damping effect on the economy. Uncertainty about the effects of the war had contributed to higher energy prices, lower equity prices, declines in measures of household confidence, and a tendency for households and especially businesses to postpone making commitments. But it was also possible that a part of the recent weakness might reflect underlying economic conditions. In the circumstances, some clarification of the Iraqi situation, which might occur in the relatively near future, should improve the Committee's ability to assess ongoing developments, though uncertainties would remain. Beyond the near term, members acknowledged that relatively subdued growth for a time could not be ruled out, but many commented that the conditions were in place for a strengthening expansion. In this regard they referred to the positive effects on business profits and consumer incomes of persisting gains in productivity, stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, and accommodative financial and bank lending markets. The likelihood of continued low or even declining inflation was high, especially given expectations of persisting slack in resource utilization.In the course of the Committee's review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members underscored the retarding effects of reduced confidence and heightened caution on household and business spending but noted that it was difficult to attribute the relative contributions of geopolitical risk and worries about the economy to the emergence of weaker spending. In any event, consumer expenditures appeared to have been held back recently by the impact of higher energy costs, weak labor markets, and severe winter weather in the eastern part of the United States. Sales of motor vehicles had declined substantially since the start of the year despite the introduction of enhanced sales incentives. Non-automotive retail sales, after a pickup at the end of 2002 that had extended through the first several weeks of this year, had weakened more recently. Whether the recent experience augured further softening in consumer spending was uncertain, but some members commented that this weak performance was not reassuring with regard to forecasts of substantial strengthening of the expansion later this year. Many observed, however, that a favorable outcome to the hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices in line with quotations in futures markets should generate a positive response in equity markets, boost consumer sentiment, and foster a rebound in consumer spending as the year progressed.    Housing activity had held up well on the whole, despite a negative report on housing starts for February, and indeed was displaying continued strength in many parts of the nation. In numerous areas, however, sales of high-end homes had continued to lag and there were reports of a softening in the middle-market single-family sector in some areas. Members also cited indications of overbuilding in some parts of the country, notably of multifamily housing. On balance, generally robust homebuilding activity was expected to persist against the backdrop of low mortgage interest rates and rising household incomes. With regard to the outlook for business capital expenditures, members commented that a variety of factors likely would induce business firms to continue to hold back on new investment initiatives, at least over the near term. Indeed, there was as yet no persuasive evidence that business fixed investment would provide the needed support for the strengthening in overall economic activity. Geopolitical uncertainties, notably those relating to developments in Iraq, frequently were cited by business contacts as a major reason for caution, but other factors inhibiting capital expenditures evidently included excess capacity and limited prospects for profits because of increased energy, insurance, pension, and other costs and a concomitant inability to raise selling prices.  At the same time, there was only limited evidence thus far that the partial-expensing tax incentive, scheduled to expire in September 2004, was having a measurable effect on outlays for new equipment and software. The outlook for commercial construction activity was especially downbeat because of high vacancy rates in industrial and office structures in many areas, and a general upturn in such construction was viewed as unlikely to occur for an extended period of time. While resolution of some of the uncertainties relating to Iraq seemed likely in the relatively near term, many business contacts reported that they would continue to hold down their capital investments until demand for their goods and services and related profit opportunities displayed clear signs of significant improvement. Some members nonetheless referred to indications of increasing expenditures for various categories of high-tech equipment and software, and they noted that impetus to demand from a positive outcome in the war against Iraq should have a favorable effect on business capital spending, especially if it were accompanied by a rally in the stock market. Many firms were trying to keep their inventories at especially low levels in light of their concerns that projected sales might not materialize. Members cited the resulting lean inventories as a positive element in the outlook for economic activity, given likely efforts by business firms to maintain inventories in broad aligment with anticipated growth over time in final sales. Federal government spending continued to rise rapidly, led by large increases in defense and homeland security expenditures, and members noted that the resulting impetus to growth might be augmented by passage of a fiscal stimulus package in line with that proposed by the Administration. Considerable uncertainty surrounded the eventual size of such a package or even whether it would be enacted this year. A partial offset to the federal fiscal stimulus stemmed from efforts to address deepening budget crises in a number of states and their adverse implications for many local economies.   Against the background of persistent strength in productivity growth and continued low levels of capital and labor utilization, inflation would likely remain subdued going forward. Indeed, members saw further disinflation in core prices as a distinct possibility over the next several quarters. At the same time, the outlook for oil prices and energy prices more generally was uncertain and, despite market expectations, oil prices might remain relatively high in the event of adverse developments in Iraq and in some other major oil producing countries that were experiencing serious economic and political problems. However, high oil prices, should they persist, were likely to have more of an effect in damping demand than in raising inflation, given well-entrenched expectations of low inflation.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, the members unanimously supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance. While the economic expansion had displayed signs of faltering in recent weeks, the reasons for and hence the duration of any period of weakness could not be reliably ascertained. In that regard, members commented that as key geopolitical uncertainties diminished or were resolved, the Committee would be in a much better position to assess economic trends and a desirable course for monetary policy. Monetary policy was positioned to accommodate a strengthening economic performance that seemed likely to materialize once key uncertainties and related concerns began to decrease, perhaps in the relatively near future, and business and consumer sentiment started to improve. To be sure, the timing and speed of a pickup in economic activity were not clear, and some members saw continued growth below potential as the primary risk for the near term. The members concluded that the prudent course in current circumstances was to maintain a steady policy stance, a high degree of vigilance, and a readiness to respond promptly as needed to the emergence of clearer evidence relating to the performance of the economy. In the latter regard, some members cautioned that the Committee might well need to adjust its policy in circumstances that continued to be characterized by a substantial degree of uncertainty.The Committee decided to omit its usual statement regarding the balance of risks from the press release to be made public shortly after the meeting. Most members believed that the major uncertainties surrounding the geopolitical situation made it impossible to assign reasonable probabilities to plausible alternative economic outcomes and that any effort to do so would provide a misleading impression of the Committee's confidence and knowledge about the economic outlook. In light of these considerable uncertainties, the members agreed that heightened surveillance of evolving economic trends would be especially useful in the weeks ahead. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1-1/4 percent.Votes for this action:  Messrs. Greenspan, McDonough, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, and Parry.    Votes against this action: None. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 6, 2003.   The meeting adjourned at 12:50 p.m. Following the outbreak of war in Iraq, the members of the Committee participated in a series of conference calls held on March 25, April 1, April 8, and April 16 in order to keep abreast of the latest information and to exchange views regarding the possible implications of current developments for the economic outlook and monetary policy. No policy decisions were made in this period. Vincent R.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.\\tThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period March 18, 2003, through May 5, 2003.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions. With Mr. Broaddus dissenting, the Committee voted to extend for one year beginning in mid-December 2003 the reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico.  The arrangement with the Bank of Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent and that with the Bank of Mexico in the amount of $3 billion equivalent.  Both arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve\\'s participation in the North American Framework Agreement.  The vote to renew the System\\'s participation in the swap arrangements maturing in December was taken at this meeting because of the provision that each party must provide six months prior notice of an intention to terminate its participation. Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that the swap lines exist primarily to facilitate foreign exchange market intervention, and he was opposed to such intervention for the reasons he had expressed at the January meeting.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity continued to grow at a subpar pace in recent months.  Consumer spending advanced slightly in the first quarter and housing activity remained at a high level, but business investment slowed.  Industrial production was sluggish, and additional slack accumulated in the labor market.  Core consumer inflation had moved lower, but overall consumer prices had been pushed up recently by sharp rises in energy prices.Private nonfarm payroll employment continued to fall in April.  Manufacturing employment registered widespread losses, and the retail trade, transportation, and utilities industries extended their declines of prior months.  The unemployment rate rose to 6 percent in April, with increases spread widely across most demographic groups.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance remained at an elevated level, suggesting further labor market weakness in May.Industrial production fell in March, and weekly physical product data and other indicators pointed to another drop in April.  Lower output at utilities accounted for some of the decline in overall production in March but manufacturing output, especially motor vehicle assemblies, fell again.  Total industrial capacity utilization declined in March, with capacity utilization in manufacturing reaching a twenty-year low.Real personal consumer expenditures rose in March and for the first quarter as a whole.  Spending on durable goods increased in March but was down a bit for the full quarter.  By contrast, spending on services and nondurable goods fell in March but was up on balance in the first quarter.  Disposable income was unchanged in March.  Measures of consumer confidence rebounded sharply in April after sizable declines in February and March.Residential housing activity remained solid, though some signs of potential moderation emerged.  Supported by continued low mortgage rates, first-quarter housing starts in the single-family sector stayed at the high level of the fourth quarter.  Multifamily starts also changed little in the first three months of the year and vacancy rates in the sector remained high.  Sales of existing homes were off a bit in March, but sales for the first quarter as a whole edged up from the fourth-quarter rate.  New home sales, however, were down from their fourth-quarter pace. Real outlays on equipment and software declined in the first quarter after rising moderately over the three preceding quarters.  A sharp drop in purchases of transportation equipment more than accounted for the first-quarter decline.  The weakness in the transportation category reflected sluggish expenditures for aircraft, medium and heavy trucks, and light vehicles.  By contrast, the high-tech category recorded strong growth owing to a surge in spending for computer and peripheral equipment and an upturn in purchases of communications equipment.  Although investment fundamentals, such as corporate cash flows and reduced costs of capital, remained favorable, reports from businesses were downbeat.  The extended decline in real investment spending on nonresidential structures moderated further in the first quarter, with the smallest decline since the first quarter of 2001.Real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles appeared to have declined a little in the first quarter after accumulating in recent quarters.  The buildup of manufacturing and trade inventories, however, continued in January and February at an average pace similar to that of the second half of 2002.  Relative to sales, non-auto inventory stocks in most sectors were low by recent standards.  According to industry reports, inventories in the motor vehicle industry apparently had risen above desired levels.The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed slightly in February and brought the average deficit for January and February to an annual rate near that of the fourth quarter.  The narrowing in February was accounted for by a small decline in imports and a marginal rise in exports.  Recent indicators suggested continued sluggish economic growth in most foreign industrial nations.  The Japanese economy was about flat in the early months of the year, activity in the euro area remained subdued, and first-quarter growth in the United Kingdom was lackluster.  Canadian domestic demand remained relatively robust but appeared to be slowing.  Economic conditions in other countries were mixed.  In Latin America, Mexican data releases pointed toward increases in economic activity, and the Argentine economy continued to show signs of recovery.  In contrast, Venezuela remained in crisis, and economic activity in Brazil appeared to have moderated despite improved financial market conditions.  In developing Asia, indicators suggested that economic growth had slowed in much of the region.  China, however, registered robust growth in the first quarter.Core consumer price inflation moved down further in the first quarter from its already low level.  A sharp run-up in energy prices, however, pushed up overall consumer prices in the first quarter and in the year ended in March (measured by both the consumer price index and the chain-type personal consumption expenditure index).  Producer prices also were boosted significantly by the jump in energy prices in recent months.  Core producer prices were up appreciably in the first quarter but at a slower pace than overall producer prices.  With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose at a faster rate during the three months ended in March, reflecting increases in wages and salaries and in benefit costs.  The expansion of compensation costs over the twelve months ended in March was virtually the same as in the previous twelve-month period.When the Committee met on March 18, 2003, the nation appeared to be on the brink of war.  At the end of that meeting, the Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1-1/4 percent.  The Committee agreed to indicate in its announcement that in light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation in the short run and their apparent effects on economic decisionmaking, it could not at that time usefully characterize the current balance of risks with respect to the prospects for its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth.  The Committee also agreed that heightened surveillance would be particularly informative.  It was noted that while the recent economic data were mixed, the hesitancy of the economic expansion appeared to owe significantly to oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties.  The Committee believed that as those uncertainties lifted, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with the ongoing growth in productivity, would provide vital support toward fostering improving economic performance over time.The decision to leave policy on hold had been largely anticipated by market participants, but the inclusion in the policy announcement of a reference to \"heightened surveillance\" led initially to downward revisions to expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate.  The abatement of war-related risks was reflected in sizable declines in forward-looking measures of uncertainty in short- and long-term interest rates, exchange rates, and oil and equity prices.  Nearer-term Treasury yields had fallen, but longer-term Treasury yields had changed little since the March meeting.  Risk spreads on corporate debt securities narrowed across the credit quality spectrum.  Broad equity indexes registered notable gains related to better-than-expected corporate earnings reports.In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the major foreign currencies declined over the intermeeting period. The dollar depreciated somewhat more against the euro and the Canadian dollar and only slightly against the Japanese yen. The dollar also declined against an index of currencies of other important trading partners.  Equity markets in the major industrial economies, except Japan, had risen significantly since the March FOMC meeting.Growth in M2 slowed over March and April, but most of the deceleration appeared to be attributable to temporary tax-related flows of funds.  A movement toward earlier electronic filing apparently weakened M2 in March by shifting refund distributions into February.  Reduced M2 growth in April reflected, in part, slower-than-average buildups of deposits associated with final tax payments by individuals.  Substantial net inflows to equity mutual funds occurred during the same period.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that economic expansion would be sluggish in the near term.  Faced with persisting weakness in product and labor markets, businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending.  In addition, continued slow economic growth in most of the nation\\'s major trading partners would tend to restrain U.S. exports, though those restraints were expected to abate over time.  The cumulative effects of an  accommodative monetary policy, likely further reduction in taxes, and robust gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus to spending.  Inventory overhangs had been substantially reduced, and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels.  As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to gradually boost business investment spending.  Given the ongoing slack in resource utilization, downward restraint on core price inflation was expected to persist over the forecast period.In the Committee\\'s discussion, members commented that the recent information bearing on the economic outlook was mixed.  The latest reports on economic activity generally were disappointing, notably those relating to employment and production, but members noted that most of these reports covered developments occurring before the end of hostilities in Iraq.  The successful prosecution of the war had served to reduce geopolitical uncertainties and in turn had helped to foster a marked strengthening of domestic financial markets, a sizable decline in oil prices, and an apparent upturn in consumer confidence. In this improved environment, members anticipated that near-term sluggishness in economic growth would give way to more vigorous expansion as the year progressed. In support of this expectation, it was noted that if the substantial gains in financial markets experienced recently persisted, experience indicated that a stronger economic performance generally would follow.  Favorable factors in the outlook mentioned by members included an accommodative monetary policy, prospective legislation that would increase an already stimulative fiscal policy, and evidence of a persisting uptrend in productivity that provided enhanced investment opportunities and ongoing support for household incomes.  Continued progress in lifting various constraints on economic growth, including the unwinding of excessive or misdirected capital expenditures undertaken in earlier years and the steps taken to address corporate governance and credit problems were also working to strengthen the expansion. Against that backdrop, it was noteworthy that many private-sector forecasters predicted a pronounced upturn in economic growth in the third quarter.  Despite underlying factors that seemed increasingly conducive to an accelerating expansion, members noted that the timing and vigor of a pickup in economic activity remained uncertain, especially in the context of a persistently high degree of caution in the business community with regard to investment and hiring decisions. With the removal of key uncertainties associated with the Iraqi war, the information that would become available in the weeks ahead was expected to provide a clearer basis for assessing future trends in business spending and, more generally, the underlying strength of the economy.  Members anticipated that inflation would remain at a low level for an extended period and indeed that the probability of further disinflation was higher than that of a pickup in inflation, given the current high levels of excess capacity in labor and product markets, which seemed likely to diminish only gradually.Business fixed investment remained a key factor in the prospects for overall economic activity, and persisting weakness in such spending in association with gloomy sentiment and a high degree of risk aversion among business decisionmakers did not bode well for the capital investment outlook, at least for the near term. Anecdotal reports by business contacts tended to emphasize widespread excess capacity as a reason for holding down business capital spending, including high vacancy rates in office and other business structures. In this atmosphere, most business decisionmakers evidently preferred to rely on the increasingly efficient or fuller utilization of existing producer facilities rather than expanding the latter to meet growth in demand. Indeed, according to business contacts, investment expenditures generally were limited to replacement and to some extent to upgrading of existing facilities rather than for expansion. In some cases, businesses reportedly were acquiring used capital equipment and unoccupied building space at greatly reduced costs, thereby holding down the current production of new capital but also relieving selling firms of some excess capacity. Members nonetheless saw a number of favorable elements in the outlook for business investment expenditures. These included a decline in the cost of business capital, a recent rise in orders and backlogs of nondefense capital goods, persisting gains in productivity that undoubtedly pointed to growing profit opportunities, progress in strengthening business balance sheets, and reduced capital overhangs. With regard to business attitudes, members reported very recent but also widespread indications from their contacts that business confidence might be in the process of improving, though the upturn in confidence was not likely to show through to investment outlays for some time.In the household sector, an appreciable decline in sales of motor vehicles and slower growth in other consumer spending in the first quarter appeared to reflect concerns relating to the Iraqi war and adverse weather conditions in some parts of the country. More recently, attractive sales incentives had boosted consumer purchases of motor vehicles, albeit not as much as some industry contacts had hoped, and members referred to tentative signs of a pickup in retail sales. On balance, however, the members did not see any firm indications of significant acceleration in consumer spending. More positively, they cited recent survey and anecdotal evidence of improving consumer confidence and referred to the gains in the stock market as a source of potential impetus going forward. In the housing markets, activity currently was somewhat uneven across the nation but had remained at a high overall level. While favorable financing would help to sustain the housing sector, members anticipated that any further impetus to growth from that sector was likely to be limited.The members expected economic activity to be supported by substantial fiscal stimulus in coming quarters, with that already built into existing federal legislation likely to be augmented by further initiatives under active consideration in the Congress. However, budgets of numerous state and local governments remained under severe pressure, and efforts to contain spending and raise taxes by those governments would offset some of the federal stimulus this year and next. It was not clear at this point how some state and local governments would resolve their current budgetary crises and what the effects would be on many local economies.A weakening dollar and sluggish economic conditions abroad were key factors impinging on the prospective contribution of the foreign sector to U.S. economic activity. While foreign demand for U.S. products and services would be supported by the dollar\\'s depreciation, relatively weak foreign economic activity would tend to hold down such demand.  On balance, the nation\\'s trade deficit was likely to remain at an elevated level, with moderate gains in exports more than offset by larger increases in imports if forecasts of relatively robust U.S. growth in fact materialized.Even assuming a pickup in the expansion of economic activity in line with current forecasts for this year and next, excess capacity in labor and product markets would remain elevated and might well foster further disinflation over coming quarters. The decline in inflation might be limited to some extent by the depreciated value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets and by the anticipated effects of further large increases in worker benefit costs. Given the pressure of a considerable amount of unused resources, any adverse developments that held down economic expansion would increase the probability of further disinflation. Members commented that substantial additional disinflation would be unwelcome because of the likely negative effects on economic activity and the functioning of financial institutions and markets, and the increased difficulty of conducting an effective monetary policy, at least potentially in the event the economy was subjected to adverse shocks.   Members also agreed that there was only a remote possibility that the process of disinflation would cumulate to the point of a decline for an extended period in the general price level.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members indicated that they could support a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance.  The members acknowledged that a case could be made for easing policy immediately in light of the generally disappointing reports on the recent performance of the economy, the ongoing disinflation trend in a period of already low inflation, and forecasts of persisting excess capacity. Nonetheless, they concluded that, on balance, an easing action was not desirable at this time. They noted that not enough time had elapsed since the end of the Iraqi war to sort out the underlying forces at work in the economy.  In particular, the lifting of key uncertainties relating to the war would provide an improved opportunity to assess whether the favorable factors in the outlook would in fact lead to the anticipated strengthening in economic activity and, at the same time, diminish the risk of appreciable further disinflation. Some members cautioned that persisting uncertainty regarding economic trends should not provide a basis for prolonged inaction in light of the risks of further disinflation and subpar economic growth.  In the absence of convincing indications of an appreciable pickup in economic growth, an easing move might be desirable in the near term, perhaps at the June meeting. With regard to the press announcement to be released shortly after this meeting, the members supported new language that provided separate assessments of the risks to the goal for acceptable economic growth and the risks to the goal of price stability. They recognized that the usual summary statement did not allow for the circumstances in which the Committee saw some probability, albeit minor, of a significant further decline in inflation to an unwelcome level. After discussion, the members generally agreed on separate sentences indicating that the risks to its goal of sustainable economic growth were about balanced but that the probability of some disinflation from an already low level exceeded that of a pickup in inflation. The members also accepted a summary statement stating that, taken together, the balance of risks to the Committee\\'s dual goals was tilted toward the downside over the foreseeable future. There was some concern that including such a summary sentence in the press release might be mistakenly interpreted as an indication of Committee concern about the outlook for economic activity rather than a judgment about the relative odds on further inflation.  Two members saw merit in adopting a balanced risks assessment at this meeting despite the evident shortcomings in present circumstances of the form of such statements in use in recent years.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive.  Consistent with the decision made at the March meeting, the vote did not formally encompass the wording of the press statement to be released shortly after this meeting.The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1-1/4 percent.

Evans, Hilton, and Kuttner, 1 Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, New York, and New York respectivelyBy unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on May 6, 2003, were approved.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period May 6, 2003, through June 24, 2003.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Committee discussed at length alternative means of providing monetary stimulus should the target federal funds rate be reduced to a point where there was little or no latitude for additional easing through this conventional policy instrument. The members agreed that current economic conditions and the prevailing stances of monetary and fiscal policy made the need to use unusual monetary policy tools a quite remote possibility.  Even so, they believed it was useful to discuss that possibility because of the implications for financial markets and institutions and for the conduct of monetary policy of reducing short-term interest rates to very low levels. An environment involving such interest rates could have adverse repercussions on the functioning of some sectors of the money market, but the members agreed that the potential extent of such disruptions would not be sufficient to prevent the Committee from taking advantage of the full scope of conventional easing of the federal funds rate, should that become necessary.  Beyond that, a variety of nonconventional measures for further easing was available. In this regard, the members discussed the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches that, possibly employed in some combination, would alter the size and composition of the System\\'s balance sheet. They also considered aspects of the Committee\\'s communications as a means of underscoring to the public its willingness to follow a sufficiently accommodative path of monetary policy for as long as necessary to foster improved economic performance.  The members did not see the need at this time to reach a consensus on the desirability of any specific nontraditional approach to the implementation of monetary policy, particularly given the low probability of its near-term use.  As experience had shown, at times of economic and financial market stress the specific policy tools used would depend on circumstances. For now, however, they believed that arriving at an understanding of the various options that might be employed prepared them to respond more flexibly and effectively to unanticipated developments. While considerable uncertainty surrounded each individual policy option, the members agreed that the effectiveness of these alternative tools, along with the 125 basis points of conventional easing still available, would allow monetary policy to combat economic weakness and forestall any unexpected tendency for a pernicious deflation to develop.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy continued to expand at a subpar pace in recent months.  Consumer spending increased moderately, housing activity held at a high level, and government outlays grew substantially.  Business investment, however, was still soft.  Industrial production and employment appeared to have stabilized after an extended period of weakness.  Consumer price inflation remained at a very low level.Private nonfarm payrolls changed little on balance in April and May after declines earlier in the year.  Although employment in manufacturing continued to fall in May, hiring in temporary help services, which supplies many of its workers to manufacturing, picked up noticeably.  Construction and financial services continued to add jobs.  Unemployment edged up further in May, to 6.1 percent, and the number of both short-term job losers and longer-term unemployed increased as well.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance remained high.Industrial production increased slightly in May after sizable declines in the preceding two months.  The manufacturing sector recorded broad-based improvement, though automobile assemblies and the output of communications equipment continued to slide.  The effects of strength in the mining sector on the industrial production index were more than offset by a reduction in utility output.  Overall capacity utilization remained very low, with manufacturing utilization near a twenty-year low.Real consumer outlays, excluding cars and trucks, were flat in April but turned up in May.  Spending on motor vehicles rose over the two months from the first-quarter pace.  At the same time, the fundamentals underlying household spending became more favorable:  Real disposable income posted solid gains, and both the stock market and consumer confidence recovered from earlier in the year.Activity in the housing market was reasonably well maintained in April and May.  Despite unusually wet weather in many areas, starts of single-family and multifamily units in the two months were just a little below their strong first-quarter levels.  Building permits for new single-family and multifamily homes were up from a depressed March level.  Sales of both existing and new homes in April and May were above the high levels recorded in recent quarters.Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods were lackluster in April and May.  This sluggish performance followed a first-quarter decline in real outlays on equipment and software that had more than reversed the fourth-quarter gains.  Excluding purchases of transportation equipment, however, outlays grew a bit over the first quarter.  Real investment in nonresidential structures dropped further in that quarter, though the rate of decline slowed. Outlays for office buildings and industrial structures were down sharply, and falling rents and rising vacancy rates in April suggested further weakness in the second quarter.The book value of manufacturing inventories rose moderately further in the first quarter and in April.  Relative to shipments and sales, inventories of manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers have remained at quite low levels thus far this year.The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services edged up in April from the first-quarter rate.  Real GDP growth in the major foreign industrial countries remained weak in the first quarter as external demand sagged amid heightened geopolitical uncertainties.  Real GDP growth continued to slow in the first quarter in Japan and the United Kingdom, and economic activity in the euro area was flat.  By contrast, economic activity accelerated in Canada in the first quarter.  Sharp declines in energy prices pulled down overall consumer prices in April and May, but core consumer prices edged up.  On a year-over-year basis, however, core consumer price inflation eased noticeably.  Core producer price inflation also declined over the year ending in May.  With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers were flat in April and increased moderately in May.   The twelve-month change was somewhat above that for the year earlier.At its May 6, 2003, meeting the Federal Open Market Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate at around 1-1/4 percent.  The Committee discussed a post-meeting release to the press stating that over the next few quarters the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth were roughly equal, but that, in contrast, over the same period the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeded that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level.  The Committee also agreed to a statement that, taken together, the balance of risks to achieving its goals was weighted toward weakness over the foreseeable future.  The Committee noted that, while the geopolitical tensions that had inhibited economic expansion in earlier months appeared to have diminished, the timing and extent of an improving economic performance could not be reliably ascertained.  In the current circumstances, the members concluded the prudent course was to maintain a steady policy stance, a high degree of vigilance, and a readiness to respond promptly as needed to the emergence of clearer evidence relating to the performance of the economy.The Committee\\'s decision at the May meeting relating to the federal funds rate was not a surprise to most market participants.  However, splitting the balance of risks statement into separate assessments about growth and inflation, in addition to noting a concern about a further possible decline of inflation from an already low level, led market participants to mark down their expectations for the federal funds rate.  Consistent with those expectations, Treasury coupon yields declined 35 to 60 basis points.  Yields on corporate bonds also fell about in line with rates on Treasuries even though capital markets absorbed a surge in bond issuance by highly rated firms.  Equity prices, buoyed by the decline in bond yields as well as the improved outlook for economic growth, registered sizable gains over the intermeeting period.The dollar continued to depreciate in terms of an index of major foreign currencies amid growing concerns about the financing burden of the large and growing U.S. current account deficit and questions by market participants about the commitment of U.S authorities to a \"strong dollar\" policy.  Long-term interest rates fell in all major industrial economies, while equity prices rose substantially.Growth of M2 surged in May.  At least part of the acceleration was due to special factors related to strong mortgage refinancing activity and to the flow of funds associated with tax payments.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting once again suggested that the economic expansion would strengthen substantially as the year progressed.  Accommodative financial conditions, recent additional fiscal stimulus, and robust gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus to spending over the months ahead.  Inventory overhangs had been substantially reduced, and business capital stocks likely had moved closer to desired levels.  As a consequence, improving sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected gradually to boost business investment spending.  Given the ongoing slack in resource utilization, downward pressure on core price inflation was expected over the forecast period.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to signs of improvement in some sectors of the economy, but they saw no conclusive evidence of an appreciable overall strengthening in the sluggish economic expansion. On the positive side, they pointed to reports of some pickup in retail sales, indications that labor and product markets might be stabilizing, continued robust activity in housing markets, and ongoing impetus from the federal government sector. Concurrently, however, weakness persisted in business capital expenditures, which members continued to view as the critical factor inhibiting the economic expansion. Looking ahead, they emphasized that favorable underlying conditions were in place to support a substantial acceleration of the expansion, though the timing and dimensions of a significantly improved economic performance remained uncertain. Positive factors bearing on the outlook mentioned by members included the accommodative stance of monetary policy and supportive financial conditions more generally, the persistence of rapid growth in labor productivity, sizable declines in energy prices from elevated levels earlier in the year, and indications of rising consumer confidence and of less negative business sentiment. Members also gave considerable emphasis to the anticipated effects of recent legislation that in short order would add substantially to the degree of fiscal stimulus. In their review of the outlook for inflation, members commented that currently elevated levels of unused labor and other resources were likely to persist for an extended period, even if economic growth turned out to be robust. And until it was substantially reduced, the output gap would undoubtedly preclude any significant acceleration in inflation and could well cause inflation to edge down from its already low level. At the same time, a substantial further decline in inflation was viewed as having a low probability, though disinflation would remain a matter of concern until a sustained pickup in overall economic activity was firmly established.            In preparation for the midyear monetary policy report to Congress, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 2003 and 2004. The members based these forecasts on their individual views as to the appropriate path of policy over the projection period and had the opportunity to update them until July 3. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP had central tendencies of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent for 2003, implying that economic growth would accelerate noticeably in the second half of the year, and 3-3/4 to 4-3/4 percent for 2004. These rates of growth were associated with central tendencies for the civilian rate of unemployment of 6 to 6-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 5-1/2 to 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Forecasts of inflation, as measured by the chain-type price index for personal consumption expenditures, pointed to the persistence of quite low inflation rates centered on ranges of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent for this year and 1 to 1-1/2 percent in 2004.Despite some differences with regard to the timing and strength of the anticipated upturn in the expansion, the members agreed that accommodative monetary and fiscal policies along with much improved financial conditions were likely to foster a better economic performance over time. Growing market perceptions that monetary policy would remain stimulative for a longer period than previously anticipated appeared to have contributed to significant declines in interest rates across maturities and risk classes, and to rising prices in equity markets. The gains in equity prices and a narrowing of risk spreads also appeared to reflect more upbeat assessments of underlying business conditions and, partly in concert with reduced geopolitical risks since the end of major military activity in Iraq, growing convictions that the downside vulnerability of the domestic economy had diminished. Both business firms and households had continued to take advantage of generally improving financial conditions to strengthen their balance sheets through debt restructuring activities, thereby helping to buttress the economy\\'s financial underpinnings and foster sustained expansion.The ongoing stimulative effects of earlier tax cuts and large increases in defense spending had recently been enhanced by added fiscal stimulus that would provide households with more spendable income in the months immediately ahead than had been anticipated earlier. The expected result would be a relatively prompt and sizable boost to consumer expenditures and, over time, to business spending. Some members expressed reservations, however, about the extent of the near-term effects of tax rate reductions on overall consumer spending, given the likelihood that some portion of the funds transferred to households would be used to reduce personal debts or to add to various savings vehicles. Members also noted that measures taken by many state and local governments to raise taxes and trim spending in order to resolve fiscal crises would offset an uncertain--though in the view of most a small--part of the federal sector stimulus over the period ahead.  On balance, given the combined effects of lower tax rates and the outlook for continued high levels of defense spending, the federal sector generally was seen as an important source of stimulus to the economy, both in the near term and over the forecast horizon.With regard to the outlook for key expenditure sectors of the economy, members again commented that the prospects for robust and sustained expansion would depend importantly on business fixed investment, a sector where significant recovery had thus far failed to materialize. A high degree of caution continued to dominate business decisionmaking in the context of weak markets for the output of numerous firms and the related absence of pricing power. And while the low cost and ample availability of financing for most business firms along with the recently raised partial tax expensing provision for certain investment outlays were positive factors, reports from business executives indicated that a key factor inhibiting decisions to invest at this point was the unfavorable outlook for sales growth in the context of substantial margins of excess capacity. Members also noted that the attention of many boards of directors and other senior corporate officials remained focused on corporate governance and accounting issues rather than potential capital projects, and that concerns about vulnerabilities relating to such issues had damped appetites for taking risks. In this environment, investment outlays tended to be limited to the replacement and upgrading of existing facilities rather than expansion. A number of members nonetheless cited faint signs of more positive investment prospects, though not of currently increasing investment expenditures, gleaned from anecdotal commentary and responses to recent capital spending surveys. The latest readings on orders and shipments of durable goods were also seen as a favorable, though not a conclusive, sign of higher investment spending. In general, the members anticipated that current restraints on business investment spending would lift slowly as the expansion gathered momentum and business caution in investing and hiring diminished further in response to increasing demand.Outside the motor vehicle industry, business inventories appeared to be at generally low levels, with many retailers and others reported to be following cautious inventory policies in anticipation of sluggish sales over coming months. As a consequence, some inventory accumulation appeared likely if final demand accelerated in line with the members\\' current forecasts.   Consumer spending, though elevated, had grown at a reduced pace in recent quarters and the members generally saw some acceleration as a likely but not inevitable prospect. An important factor in this outlook was the anticipated effects of sizable additions to disposable incomes stemming from the recent tax legislation. Other favorable factors referenced by the members included indications of growing consumer confidence, the effects of rising stock market wealth on consumer balance sheets, continued opportunities for many consumers to extract equity from the appreciated value of their homes and to reduce interest service burdens by refinancing mortgages, and more fundamentally a continuing uptrend in disposable personal incomes associated in part with robust gains in labor productivity. Some members nonetheless raised a note of caution regarding the potential strength of consumer spending.  They commented in particular that the lack of significant job growth resulting from persisting business reluctance to hire new workers could undermine consumer confidence and spending at some point, though they noted that there was little evidence of this as yet. Some members also referred to the drain on disposable incomes stemming from rising local taxes and fees intended to address the severe budget problems of many state and local governments.  On balance, while they acknowledged the risks of a weaker outcome, the members generally expected the consumer sector to play a key role in their forecasts of a significantly strengthening expansion.The members continued to report a high level of housing demand in numerous parts of the country, with housing construction described as a notably robust sector in many regional economies. The strong performance of the housing industry continued to be attributed in large measure to the lowest mortgage interest rates in several decades. On a more negative note, multifamily construction was reported to be weak in a number of areas, evidently reflecting low occupancy rates and rents.Although current growth in demand from abroad was being held down by the relatively sluggish economies of major U.S. trading partners, the weaker dollar was expected to foster somewhat faster expansion in U.S. exports.  However, downward revisions to foreign growth forecasts for the balance of this year implied continuing restraint on the expansion in foreign demand for U.S. goods and services. Members nonetheless cited some anecdotal evidence of a pickup in foreign orders from U.S. manufacturers. At the same time, many U.S. business contacts continued to express concern about the strength of foreign competition for their products in domestic markets.               With the economy thought likely to continue to operate below its potential for an extended period and productivity growth expected to remain robust, the members believed that the current low-inflation environment would persist over the next several quarters and indeed that some further disinflation could be in store. In this regard, there was concern that inflation could be approaching a level that would begin to complicate the implementation of monetary policy if economic weakness unexpectedly persisted or the economy was subjected to another negative demand shock. However, in the view of at least some members, recent developments had reduced the unwelcome prospect of substantial additional disinflation. Those developments included a recent uptick in core measures of consumer prices, a drop in the dollar on foreign exchange markets, and still elevated energy prices--all against the backdrop of longer-term inflation expectations that were firmly anchored. More importantly, however, the outlook for a strengthening expansion, which might well materialize in the near future, should limit any further disinflationary trend.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but one of the members indicated that they could support a proposal to reduce the target federal funds rate ¼ percentage point to a level of 1 percent. While a significant step-up in the pace of the expansion appeared to be a likely prospect, such an outcome was still a forecast whose eventual realization, including both its timing and extent, remained uncertain. In the circumstances and given currently large margins of unemployed labor and other resources, the members agreed that an easing move was desirable to provide additional insurance that a stronger economy would in fact materialize. Some members noted that at the May meeting they had contemplated the need for an easing action at this meeting unless compelling evidence developed in the interim that the hoped-for acceleration in economic activity was clearly under way. The incoming information since the May meeting, while mildly encouraging, did not provide compelling evidence to warrant forestalling an easing action. Members saw virtually no prospect that the proposed easing, though it would reinforce an already accommodative monetary policy, would incur any significant risk of contributing to rising inflationary pressures, even if the strengthening of the economy proved to be somewhat greater than they had incorporated in their forecasts. Indeed, the proposed reduction in the nominal federal funds rate would about offset the apparent increase in the real federal funds rate stemming from a recent decline in inflation. In this regard, further disinflation seemed likely to be a more significant concern than rising inflation for a considerable period of time.Most of the members expressed a preference for limiting the reduction to ¼ percentage point.  Some commented that a good case could be made for a ½ percentage point easing, though all but one of these members could support the smaller decrease. Views cited in favor of the ¼ percentage point easing included the emergence of firmer signs of a possible upturn in economic activity, the near-term prospect of substantial added fiscal stimulus, and an already very accommodative stance of monetary policy. No member expressed the opinion that a smaller move should be favored because of concerns about dislocations resulting from a very low level of the overnight interest rate. However, some members commented that a larger reduction might be misread as an indication of more concern among policymakers about the economic outlook than was in fact the case.  Moreover, a 50 basis point reduction that was associated with the communication of a Committee view that the risks to achieving its objectives for economic activity were balanced might be mistakenly interpreted in the view of some members as a signal that the Committee had come to the end of its policy easing moves--a judgment they were not prepared to make at this time. The case for a larger 50 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate focused on the desirability of a relatively forceful policy move that would be more likely to promote a strengthening economic expansion and at the same time provide greater assurance of countering any significant disinflation. One member, who interpreted recent economic developments as providing fairly persuasive indications that an upturn in the expansion was already under way, saw merit in keeping policy unchanged but did not oppose a ¼ percentage point easing.Concerning the press statement to be released to the public shortly after today\\'s meeting, the members agreed that it should include a reference to signs of firming economic activity and should highlight the key factors underlying the members\\' outlook for a more robust economic performance over time. Nonetheless, inflation could edge lower and the Committee needed to be cognizant of the risk of substantial further disinflation, which could have potentially adverse effects. With regard to the Committee\\'s assessment of the risks to be incorporated in the press release, the members generally agreed that the risks to the goal of sustainable economic growth were about balanced for the next few quarters and that the probability of appreciable further disinflation from an already low level of inflation exceeded the probability of a rise in inflation. The members also endorsed a general statement stating that, taken together, the balance of risks to the Committee\\'s dual goals was tilted toward the downside for the foreseeable future. During the discussion, several members also stressed the importance of communicating clearly the reasons for the Committee\\'s decisions, thereby helping to assure the success of the Committee\\'s policymaking efforts.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 1 percent.  The vote encompassed the following statement whose substance would be included in the press release to be made available shortly after the meeting:The risks to the Committee\\'s outlook for sustainable economic growth over the next several quarters are balanced; the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next several quarters are weighted toward the downside; and, taken together, the balance of risks to its objectives is weighted toward the downside in the foreseeable future.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, and Stewart. (Mr. Stewart voted as an alternate member.)  Votes against this action: Mr. Parry.Mr. Parry dissented because he preferred a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate target as insurance against continued sluggishness in economic activity and further declines in inflation measures to undesirably low rates.  While he believed that a significant increase in the pace of activity over the next several quarters was likely, he had not yet seen convincing evidence that this process was under way.  Moreover, the current slack in labor and product markets was likely to persist for some time even with a significant pickup in real GDP growth, and this prospect threatened to reduce inflation further.  Finally, recent declines in inflation expectations had raised the real federal funds rate.  In order to offset that increase and provide additional stimulus, he saw a 50 basis point reduction in the rate as desirable.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, August 12, 2003.

Evans and Brian F. Madigan were elected as Associate Economists of the Committee to serve until the election of their successors at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee after December 31, 2003, with the understanding that in the event of the discontinuance of their official connection with the Board of Governors or with a Federal Reserve Bank, they would cease to have any official connection with the Federal Open Market Committee.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.\\t\\tThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period May 6, 2003, through June 24, 2003.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was mixed in late spring and early summer.  The labor market remained weak, and industrial production improved only slightly.  Consumer spending, however, advanced further, with brisk growth in expenditures on autos and other durables and more modest expansion in other categories.  Homebuilding continued at a robust rate, business spending improved somewhat, and federal government expenditures remained elevated, but these gains were partially offset by fiscal restraint at the state and local government levels.  Despite a recent uptick in consumer prices, year-over-year consumer inflation remained at a very low level.   Private nonfarm payroll employment fell in both June and July.  Notable losses occurred in manufacturing over the two months, continuing the trend of previous months.  Wholesale and retail trade, transportation and utilities, as well as information sectors also reduced their workforces further, while the construction, financial activities, and temporary help sectors continued to add jobs.  The average workweek edged down, on net, over June and July.  After rising to 6.4 percent in June, the unemployment rate fell to 6.2 percent in July.Industrial production edged up again in June, with gains in manufacturing offset to some extent by significant weather-related declines in utility production.  Available data for July indicated advances in motor vehicle assemblies and in iron and steel output, and also a surge in energy production that was due to abnormally warm weather. Overall industry capacity utilization was about unchanged in June as higher usage in manufacturing and mining was balanced by a sharp decrease at utilities.Real personal consumption expenditures grew in June and in the second quarter as a whole, largely reflecting a brisk rise in purchases of motor vehicles and other durable goods.  Consumption of other goods rose more moderately.  Declines in spending on energy in June held down growth in services expenditures.  Real disposable income posted a modest gain in the second quarter, and likely was lifted further in July by reduced tax withholding and by refund checks that were mailed out.  Consumer confidence readings were mixed in June and July but remained well above their lows earlier in the year.Boosted by declining mortgage rates, housing construction and sales were robust through June.  Single-family housing starts rose in June to one of the highest levels in the past twenty-five years, and new permit issuance was also strong.  Multifamily housing starts stayed at about the average level of the previous year and a half.  New home sales surged in June, but existing home sales edged down.Business outlays on equipment and software jumped in the second quarter following a lackluster performance over the preceding half year.  Spending on computers and software accelerated sharply, and purchases of communications equipment increased considerably.  The transportation category, by contrast, contracted as business spending on motor vehicles stagnated and investment in aircraft decreased.  Data on orders and shipments for nondefense capital goods in June pointed to growth in nearly all categories.  Expenditures on nonresidential structures turned up in the second quarter as increases in spending on institutional and other structures more than offset declines in expenditures for office and industrial buildings.  Office building vacancy rates changed little in the second quarter, while vacancies in industrial buildings rose to record levels.Nonfarm inventories shrank in the second quarter, with notable declines in manufacturing and wholesale stocks.  Inventories relative to shipments and sales were at low levels by historical standards.The U.S. international trade deficit edged up in May as imports of goods and services increased slightly more than exports.  Recent data generally indicated that growth in foreign industrial countries was weak in the second quarter.  The economies of Japan and the euro area appeared to have remained stagnant. Canadian economic growth was held back by both the SARS outbreak and the discovery of mad cow disease, although a rebound in employment in June suggested that the weakness was temporary.  GDP growth in the United Kingdom showed a moderate rebound in the second quarter.Overall consumer prices rose a bit in June, led by increases in the volatile food and energy categories.  Core consumer prices, however, were unchanged for the month.  Over the twelve-month period ending in June, the increase in core consumer prices as measured by both the consumer price index and the chain-type personal consumption expenditure index was notably lower than the rise of the previous year.  Higher energy costs pushed up the producer price index in June, but core producer prices ticked down for the month, leaving them slightly below their levels twelve months prior.  With regard to labor costs, July average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls advanced at about the same rate as in June.  The employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose less in the second quarter than in the first quarter.  The twelve-month increase was somewhat lower than that for the previous year.At its meeting on June 24-25, the Committee adopted a directive that called for lowering the target for the intended federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 1 percent.  In reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters as roughly equal; however, they viewed the probability, though minor, of a substantial and unwelcome fall in inflation as exceeding that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level.  On balance, the Committee believed that the concern about appreciable disinflation was likely to predominate for the foreseeable future. Longer-term interest rates began to back up after the announcement of the Committee's decision, as market participants had placed substantial odds on a larger policy move and, perhaps, even the release of details on potential unconventional policy actions.  Ten-year Treasury yields rose dramatically over the following weeks.  The increase appeared to be based on a number of factors, including investors' interpretation of the Chairman's congressional testimony, the release of Committee members' relatively bullish economic projections, and incoming news regarding the economy and corporate earnings that was seen as signaling a more likely upturn in economic growth.  In these circumstances, substantial further disinflation probably would not materialize, and the need for further reductions in the federal funds rate or unconventional policy measures would thus be obviated.  Yields on high-grade corporate bonds moved up roughly in line with those on Treasury securities, leaving spreads about unchanged.  Rates on low-grade corporate bonds rose much less, and spreads over Treasuries on such obligations narrowed significantly.  Despite the sharp step-up in Treasury yields, broad equity indexes advanced over the intermeeting period, supported by positive earning reports, strong profit forecasts, and increased confidence regarding economic prospects.The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major foreign currencies index, rose over the intermeeting period as long-term interest rate differentials moved sharply in favor of dollar-denominated assets.  Yields on longer-dated government debt of major foreign economies also increased as did many foreign equity indexes.M2 continued to grow briskly in June and July, reflecting in large part the near-zero opportunity cost of holding money, the effects of mortgage refinancing activity, and the reduction in personal income tax withholdings.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that the economic expansion would strengthen substantially as the year progressed.  Accommodative financial conditions, recent additional fiscal stimulus, and robust gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus to business and consumer spending over the months ahead.  Concurrently, household expenditures, buoyed by recent tax cuts, were expected to be well maintained.  Inventory levels had been substantially reduced, and business capital stocks apparently had continued to move closer to acceptable levels.  As a consequence, improving sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to boost business investment spending gradually.  Given the substantial ongoing slack in resource utilization, some downward pressure on core price inflation was considered a risk in the staff forecast.In their review of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that they were encouraged by the recent data on economic activity and the tone of related anecdotal commentary.  In their view these developments, in the context of stimulative fiscal and monetary policies, receptive financial conditions, and apparently improving business and consumer confidence, had brightened the prospects for substantial further strengthening of the economy. The members acknowledged that the magnitude of the improvement remained subject to considerable uncertainty, notably with regard to the prospects for business expenditures, and they cited both upside and downside risks to forecasts of a more vigorous expansion. Concerning the prospects for inflation, members expressed the view that even if growth somewhat above the economy's potential were to materialize over the next several quarters, which many regarded as a likely scenario, substantial excess margins of labor and other resources would remain and would continue to hold down overall inflation. Indeed, a number of members saw merit in the staff forecast that some further disinflation was a likely prospect in such circumstances.   Members commented that current financial conditions remained a positive factor in the outlook for the economy even after the recent rise in long-term interest rates.  To be sure, the increase would have some restraining effect.  Indeed, mortgage refinancing activity appeared to have declined substantially according to some reports, prospectively lessening the support for some consumer and other spending fostered by the extraction of equity from housing. Even so, a number of factors suggested that the risks from higher interest rates might not be large. These included the possibility that the higher rates in part reflected growing optimism about the economic outlook that would engender a faster pace of business spending, more than offsetting the effects of the higher rates on consumer spending. Moreover, long-term interest rates were still relatively low, risk spreads had narrowed in recent months, and stock prices had held firm recently, perhaps in part as a result of several upside surprises in second-quarter profit reports.Several members reiterated that business spending was the critical factor that would govern to a substantial degree the timing and extent of the acceleration in overall economic activity.  Since the year 2000, business capital expenditures had been mostly limited to replacement demand for equipment and software and, with nonresidential construction activity displaying pronounced weakness, total business fixed investment had until recently been on a declining trend. Members were encouraged, however, by evidence in recent months that an upswing in spending for capital equipment and software might be under way, including more purchases by firms of non-high-tech equipment as well as an ongoing rise in purchases of computing equipment and related peripherals. Members also reported some signs of renewed venture capital activity. Several noted that nonresidential building appeared to have stabilized in various parts of the country after a long period of decline, and there were reports that new construction projects had been initiated in some areas. It was clear, nonetheless, that business sentiment toward capital expenditures remained exceptionally cautious. Looking ahead, much would depend on further growth in demand for business products and services and associated evidence of rising profits, building on indications of strengthening in both in recent months. For now, survey and anecdotal reports on business capital spending intentions were somewhat more encouraging than earlier but were still generally mixed, with only a small number of firms planning robust capital spending programs.  Indeed, in light of the persistence of substantial margins of underutilized capital, many business contacts indicated that they intended to meet growing demand by adding staff before increasing output capacity.The weakness in business inventories that had damped the expansion thus far this year appeared to be continuing in the current quarter according to numerous business contacts. However, cautious inventory policies generally had reduced stocks to very low levels in relation to growing sales, and members saw inventory accumulation, starting perhaps late this year, as a plausible expectation. Indeed, in the view of some members, a normal cyclical swing in the accumulation of inventories that would bring the latter into a more usual alignment with growing sales could begin relatively soon and might well be markedly more pronounced than many now anticipated.  The potential for such a development constituted a sizable upside risk to current  economic forecasts for the quarters ahead.Consumer spending, buttressed by sales of motor vehicles and other consumer durables, had accelerated in the second quarter from an already elevated level and appeared more recently to be increasing considerably further. The available data pointing to improvement in early summer were limited but were supported by anecdotal information from around the country. Positive factors mentioned with regard to the outlook for the consumer sector included the recent tax cuts, the improved performance of the stock market, the ample availability of household credit, and more generally the effects of rapidly rising productivity in sustaining growth in household incomes. A potential negative cited by some members was the possibility that a weak job market, should it persist, would at some point adversely affect overall consumer sentiment and willingness to spend. Residential housing sales and construction had remained at elevated levels, evidently stimulated to an important extent by earlier declines in mortgage rates to unusually low levels. Although the appreciable upturn in those rates since midyear appeared to have slowed mortgage refinancing activity, at least in some areas, housing demand had remained buoyant perhaps in part because many homebuyers were attempting to lock in mortgage financing while rates were still low in relation to historical norms. The potential extent of retardation in housing activity stemming from higher mortgage rates was uncertain, but demand for housing was expected to be relatively well maintained, assuming the realization of forecasts of accelerating economic activity and associated growth in personal incomes.In their comments about the outlook for the foreign sector of the economy, members referred to recent signs of some strengthening in the economies of the nation's important trading partners. However, domestic demand in most of those economies remained relatively weak, and developments abroad were likely to provide little impetus to demand for U.S. exports in the near term.  At this point, business contacts tended to emphasize the persistence of strong foreign competition that was constraining their sales in both foreign and domestic markets.In their review of the outlook for prices, members generally anticipated that key inflation measures would remain near their currently low levels for an extended period. Their assessment focused on the likely persistence of substantial margins of unemployed labor and other resources even if, in line with their expectations, business activity strengthened substantially over coming quarters. Indeed, a number of members expressed the view that some further disinflation was probable over the year ahead. To be sure, inflation would remain subject to a number of crosscurrents. Upward pressures on prices would continue to be exerted by increasing medical insurance and pension costs and, for many manufacturing firms, the rising cost of materials. At the same time, the persistence of very strong competitive pressures, including those arising from foreign competitors, was preventing most business firms from passing on higher costs by raising prices, and this lack of pricing power did not appear to be diminishing. Concurrently, however, many firms were able to maintain or even to increase their profit margins through a variety of cost-cutting and productivity-enhancing measures.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance involving reserve conditions consistent with a target federal funds rate of 1 percent. Members noted that the current stance of monetary policy remained quite accommodative and, given the tenor of the latest information on the performance of the economy in the context of generally favorable financial conditions, they believed that policy was appropriately positioned to foster further strengthening of the economic expansion. While the Committee could not commit itself to a particular policy course over time, many of the members referred to the likelihood that the Committee would want to keep policy accommodative for a longer period than had been the practice in past periods of accelerating economic activity. Reasons for such an approach to policy stemmed from the need to encourage progress toward closing the economy's currently wide output gap and, with inflation already near the low end of what some members regarded as an acceptable range, to resist significant further disinflation. In the view of these members, appreciable added disinflation would potentially blunt the effectiveness of further policy easing in the event of strong adverse shocks to the economy. At the same time, maintaining an accommodative policy stance was seen as involving little risk of inducing rising inflation so long as high levels of excess capacity and very competitive markets continued to characterize economic conditions. The members agreed that, although economic activity had shown signs of firming, the risks to the outlook remained about the same as they had indicated in the previous statement issued after the June meeting. In particular, the risks to the goal of sustainable economic growth were about balanced for the next few quarters and the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation, though minor, exceeded that of a rise in inflation from its currently low level. On balance, the risk of undesirably low inflation was likely to be the Committee's predominant concern for the foreseeable future.  The Committee also decided to include a reference in the announcement to its judgment that under anticipated circumstances policy accommodation could be maintained for a considerable period.Several members commented that the nature of the Committee's communications had evolved substantially over recent meetings and that it might be useful to schedule a separate session to review current practices. They agreed to do so prior to the next scheduled meeting on September 16. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, Parry, and Stewart. (Mr. Stewart voted as an alternate member.)   Votes against this action: None.The vote encompassed the substance of the following statements concerning risks that would be conveyed in the Committee's press release to be made available shortly after the meeting:The risks to the Committee's outlook for sustainable economic growth over the next several quarters are balanced; the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next several quarters are weighted toward the downside; and, taken together, the balance of risks to its objectives is weighted toward the downside in the foreseeable future.It was agreed that the next regular meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, September 16, 2003.    The meeting adjourned at 1:15 p.m. On September 15, 2003, the Committee met to review its practices regarding the communication of its policy decisions and its assessment of the risks to its objectives of fostering sustainable economic growth and price stability.  After a detailed discussion of the issues, the Committee elected not to make substantial changes in its current approach to the policy announcement at this time.  Although a variety of views was expressed, most members felt that current practices were generally appropriate in providing information to the public about the rationale for the Committee's decisions and its views about the risks to future economic performance.  Nonetheless, members recognized that going forward they might, from time to time, consider changes that might improve the Committee's communication of its assessment of the economic situation.Vincent R.

Evans and Brian F. Madigan were elected as Associate Economists of the Committee to serve until the election of their successors at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee after December 31, 2003, with the understanding that in the event of the discontinuance of their official connection with the Board of Governors or with a Federal Reserve Bank, they would cease to have any official connection with the Federal Open Market Committee.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.\\t\\tThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period May 6, 2003, through June 24, 2003.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was mixed in late spring and early summer.  The labor market remained weak, and industrial production improved only slightly.  Consumer spending, however, advanced further, with brisk growth in expenditures on autos and other durables and more modest expansion in other categories.  Homebuilding continued at a robust rate, business spending improved somewhat, and federal government expenditures remained elevated, but these gains were partially offset by fiscal restraint at the state and local government levels.  Despite a recent uptick in consumer prices, year-over-year consumer inflation remained at a very low level.   Private nonfarm payroll employment fell in both June and July.  Notable losses occurred in manufacturing over the two months, continuing the trend of previous months.  Wholesale and retail trade, transportation and utilities, as well as information sectors also reduced their workforces further, while the construction, financial activities, and temporary help sectors continued to add jobs.  The average workweek edged down, on net, over June and July.  After rising to 6.4 percent in June, the unemployment rate fell to 6.2 percent in July.Industrial production edged up again in June, with gains in manufacturing offset to some extent by significant weather-related declines in utility production.  Available data for July indicated advances in motor vehicle assemblies and in iron and steel output, and also a surge in energy production that was due to abnormally warm weather. Overall industry capacity utilization was about unchanged in June as higher usage in manufacturing and mining was balanced by a sharp decrease at utilities.Real personal consumption expenditures grew in June and in the second quarter as a whole, largely reflecting a brisk rise in purchases of motor vehicles and other durable goods.  Consumption of other goods rose more moderately.  Declines in spending on energy in June held down growth in services expenditures.  Real disposable income posted a modest gain in the second quarter, and likely was lifted further in July by reduced tax withholding and by refund checks that were mailed out.  Consumer confidence readings were mixed in June and July but remained well above their lows earlier in the year.Boosted by declining mortgage rates, housing construction and sales were robust through June.  Single-family housing starts rose in June to one of the highest levels in the past twenty-five years, and new permit issuance was also strong.  Multifamily housing starts stayed at about the average level of the previous year and a half.  New home sales surged in June, but existing home sales edged down.Business outlays on equipment and software jumped in the second quarter following a lackluster performance over the preceding half year.  Spending on computers and software accelerated sharply, and purchases of communications equipment increased considerably.  The transportation category, by contrast, contracted as business spending on motor vehicles stagnated and investment in aircraft decreased.  Data on orders and shipments for nondefense capital goods in June pointed to growth in nearly all categories.  Expenditures on nonresidential structures turned up in the second quarter as increases in spending on institutional and other structures more than offset declines in expenditures for office and industrial buildings.  Office building vacancy rates changed little in the second quarter, while vacancies in industrial buildings rose to record levels.Nonfarm inventories shrank in the second quarter, with notable declines in manufacturing and wholesale stocks.  Inventories relative to shipments and sales were at low levels by historical standards.The U.S. international trade deficit edged up in May as imports of goods and services increased slightly more than exports.  Recent data generally indicated that growth in foreign industrial countries was weak in the second quarter.  The economies of Japan and the euro area appeared to have remained stagnant. Canadian economic growth was held back by both the SARS outbreak and the discovery of mad cow disease, although a rebound in employment in June suggested that the weakness was temporary.  GDP growth in the United Kingdom showed a moderate rebound in the second quarter.Overall consumer prices rose a bit in June, led by increases in the volatile food and energy categories.  Core consumer prices, however, were unchanged for the month.  Over the twelve-month period ending in June, the increase in core consumer prices as measured by both the consumer price index and the chain-type personal consumption expenditure index was notably lower than the rise of the previous year.  Higher energy costs pushed up the producer price index in June, but core producer prices ticked down for the month, leaving them slightly below their levels twelve months prior.  With regard to labor costs, July average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls advanced at about the same rate as in June.  The employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose less in the second quarter than in the first quarter.  The twelve-month increase was somewhat lower than that for the previous year.At its meeting on June 24-25, the Committee adopted a directive that called for lowering the target for the intended federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 1 percent.  In reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters as roughly equal; however, they viewed the probability, though minor, of a substantial and unwelcome fall in inflation as exceeding that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level.  On balance, the Committee believed that the concern about appreciable disinflation was likely to predominate for the foreseeable future. Longer-term interest rates began to back up after the announcement of the Committee's decision, as market participants had placed substantial odds on a larger policy move and, perhaps, even the release of details on potential unconventional policy actions.  Ten-year Treasury yields rose dramatically over the following weeks.  The increase appeared to be based on a number of factors, including investors' interpretation of the Chairman's congressional testimony, the release of Committee members' relatively bullish economic projections, and incoming news regarding the economy and corporate earnings that was seen as signaling a more likely upturn in economic growth.  In these circumstances, substantial further disinflation probably would not materialize, and the need for further reductions in the federal funds rate or unconventional policy measures would thus be obviated.  Yields on high-grade corporate bonds moved up roughly in line with those on Treasury securities, leaving spreads about unchanged.  Rates on low-grade corporate bonds rose much less, and spreads over Treasuries on such obligations narrowed significantly.  Despite the sharp step-up in Treasury yields, broad equity indexes advanced over the intermeeting period, supported by positive earning reports, strong profit forecasts, and increased confidence regarding economic prospects.The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major foreign currencies index, rose over the intermeeting period as long-term interest rate differentials moved sharply in favor of dollar-denominated assets.  Yields on longer-dated government debt of major foreign economies also increased as did many foreign equity indexes.M2 continued to grow briskly in June and July, reflecting in large part the near-zero opportunity cost of holding money, the effects of mortgage refinancing activity, and the reduction in personal income tax withholdings.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that the economic expansion would strengthen substantially as the year progressed.  Accommodative financial conditions, recent additional fiscal stimulus, and robust gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus to business and consumer spending over the months ahead.  Concurrently, household expenditures, buoyed by recent tax cuts, were expected to be well maintained.  Inventory levels had been substantially reduced, and business capital stocks apparently had continued to move closer to acceptable levels.  As a consequence, improving sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to boost business investment spending gradually.  Given the substantial ongoing slack in resource utilization, some downward pressure on core price inflation was considered a risk in the staff forecast.In their review of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that they were encouraged by the recent data on economic activity and the tone of related anecdotal commentary.  In their view these developments, in the context of stimulative fiscal and monetary policies, receptive financial conditions, and apparently improving business and consumer confidence, had brightened the prospects for substantial further strengthening of the economy. The members acknowledged that the magnitude of the improvement remained subject to considerable uncertainty, notably with regard to the prospects for business expenditures, and they cited both upside and downside risks to forecasts of a more vigorous expansion. Concerning the prospects for inflation, members expressed the view that even if growth somewhat above the economy's potential were to materialize over the next several quarters, which many regarded as a likely scenario, substantial excess margins of labor and other resources would remain and would continue to hold down overall inflation. Indeed, a number of members saw merit in the staff forecast that some further disinflation was a likely prospect in such circumstances.   Members commented that current financial conditions remained a positive factor in the outlook for the economy even after the recent rise in long-term interest rates.  To be sure, the increase would have some restraining effect.  Indeed, mortgage refinancing activity appeared to have declined substantially according to some reports, prospectively lessening the support for some consumer and other spending fostered by the extraction of equity from housing. Even so, a number of factors suggested that the risks from higher interest rates might not be large. These included the possibility that the higher rates in part reflected growing optimism about the economic outlook that would engender a faster pace of business spending, more than offsetting the effects of the higher rates on consumer spending. Moreover, long-term interest rates were still relatively low, risk spreads had narrowed in recent months, and stock prices had held firm recently, perhaps in part as a result of several upside surprises in second-quarter profit reports.Several members reiterated that business spending was the critical factor that would govern to a substantial degree the timing and extent of the acceleration in overall economic activity.  Since the year 2000, business capital expenditures had been mostly limited to replacement demand for equipment and software and, with nonresidential construction activity displaying pronounced weakness, total business fixed investment had until recently been on a declining trend. Members were encouraged, however, by evidence in recent months that an upswing in spending for capital equipment and software might be under way, including more purchases by firms of non-high-tech equipment as well as an ongoing rise in purchases of computing equipment and related peripherals. Members also reported some signs of renewed venture capital activity. Several noted that nonresidential building appeared to have stabilized in various parts of the country after a long period of decline, and there were reports that new construction projects had been initiated in some areas. It was clear, nonetheless, that business sentiment toward capital expenditures remained exceptionally cautious. Looking ahead, much would depend on further growth in demand for business products and services and associated evidence of rising profits, building on indications of strengthening in both in recent months. For now, survey and anecdotal reports on business capital spending intentions were somewhat more encouraging than earlier but were still generally mixed, with only a small number of firms planning robust capital spending programs.  Indeed, in light of the persistence of substantial margins of underutilized capital, many business contacts indicated that they intended to meet growing demand by adding staff before increasing output capacity.The weakness in business inventories that had damped the expansion thus far this year appeared to be continuing in the current quarter according to numerous business contacts. However, cautious inventory policies generally had reduced stocks to very low levels in relation to growing sales, and members saw inventory accumulation, starting perhaps late this year, as a plausible expectation. Indeed, in the view of some members, a normal cyclical swing in the accumulation of inventories that would bring the latter into a more usual alignment with growing sales could begin relatively soon and might well be markedly more pronounced than many now anticipated.  The potential for such a development constituted a sizable upside risk to current  economic forecasts for the quarters ahead.Consumer spending, buttressed by sales of motor vehicles and other consumer durables, had accelerated in the second quarter from an already elevated level and appeared more recently to be increasing considerably further. The available data pointing to improvement in early summer were limited but were supported by anecdotal information from around the country. Positive factors mentioned with regard to the outlook for the consumer sector included the recent tax cuts, the improved performance of the stock market, the ample availability of household credit, and more generally the effects of rapidly rising productivity in sustaining growth in household incomes. A potential negative cited by some members was the possibility that a weak job market, should it persist, would at some point adversely affect overall consumer sentiment and willingness to spend. Residential housing sales and construction had remained at elevated levels, evidently stimulated to an important extent by earlier declines in mortgage rates to unusually low levels. Although the appreciable upturn in those rates since midyear appeared to have slowed mortgage refinancing activity, at least in some areas, housing demand had remained buoyant perhaps in part because many homebuyers were attempting to lock in mortgage financing while rates were still low in relation to historical norms. The potential extent of retardation in housing activity stemming from higher mortgage rates was uncertain, but demand for housing was expected to be relatively well maintained, assuming the realization of forecasts of accelerating economic activity and associated growth in personal incomes.In their comments about the outlook for the foreign sector of the economy, members referred to recent signs of some strengthening in the economies of the nation's important trading partners. However, domestic demand in most of those economies remained relatively weak, and developments abroad were likely to provide little impetus to demand for U.S. exports in the near term.  At this point, business contacts tended to emphasize the persistence of strong foreign competition that was constraining their sales in both foreign and domestic markets.In their review of the outlook for prices, members generally anticipated that key inflation measures would remain near their currently low levels for an extended period. Their assessment focused on the likely persistence of substantial margins of unemployed labor and other resources even if, in line with their expectations, business activity strengthened substantially over coming quarters. Indeed, a number of members expressed the view that some further disinflation was probable over the year ahead. To be sure, inflation would remain subject to a number of crosscurrents. Upward pressures on prices would continue to be exerted by increasing medical insurance and pension costs and, for many manufacturing firms, the rising cost of materials. At the same time, the persistence of very strong competitive pressures, including those arising from foreign competitors, was preventing most business firms from passing on higher costs by raising prices, and this lack of pricing power did not appear to be diminishing. Concurrently, however, many firms were able to maintain or even to increase their profit margins through a variety of cost-cutting and productivity-enhancing measures.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance involving reserve conditions consistent with a target federal funds rate of 1 percent. Members noted that the current stance of monetary policy remained quite accommodative and, given the tenor of the latest information on the performance of the economy in the context of generally favorable financial conditions, they believed that policy was appropriately positioned to foster further strengthening of the economic expansion. While the Committee could not commit itself to a particular policy course over time, many of the members referred to the likelihood that the Committee would want to keep policy accommodative for a longer period than had been the practice in past periods of accelerating economic activity. Reasons for such an approach to policy stemmed from the need to encourage progress toward closing the economy's currently wide output gap and, with inflation already near the low end of what some members regarded as an acceptable range, to resist significant further disinflation. In the view of these members, appreciable added disinflation would potentially blunt the effectiveness of further policy easing in the event of strong adverse shocks to the economy. At the same time, maintaining an accommodative policy stance was seen as involving little risk of inducing rising inflation so long as high levels of excess capacity and very competitive markets continued to characterize economic conditions. The members agreed that, although economic activity had shown signs of firming, the risks to the outlook remained about the same as they had indicated in the previous statement issued after the June meeting. In particular, the risks to the goal of sustainable economic growth were about balanced for the next few quarters and the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation, though minor, exceeded that of a rise in inflation from its currently low level. On balance, the risk of undesirably low inflation was likely to be the Committee's predominant concern for the foreseeable future.  The Committee also decided to include a reference in the announcement to its judgment that under anticipated circumstances policy accommodation could be maintained for a considerable period.Several members commented that the nature of the Committee's communications had evolved substantially over recent meetings and that it might be useful to schedule a separate session to review current practices. They agreed to do so prior to the next scheduled meeting on September 16. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, Parry, and Stewart. (Mr. Stewart voted as an alternate member.)   Votes against this action: None.The vote encompassed the substance of the following statements concerning risks that would be conveyed in the Committee's press release to be made available shortly after the meeting:The risks to the Committee's outlook for sustainable economic growth over the next several quarters are balanced; the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next several quarters are weighted toward the downside; and, taken together, the balance of risks to its objectives is weighted toward the downside in the foreseeable future.It was agreed that the next regular meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, September 16, 2003.    The meeting adjourned at 1:15 p.m. On September 15, 2003, the Committee met to review its practices regarding the communication of its policy decisions and its assessment of the risks to its objectives of fostering sustainable economic growth and price stability.  After a detailed discussion of the issues, the Committee elected not to make substantial changes in its current approach to the policy announcement at this time.  Although a variety of views was expressed, most members felt that current practices were generally appropriate in providing information to the public about the rationale for the Committee's decisions and its views about the risks to future economic performance.  Nonetheless, members recognized that going forward they might, from time to time, consider changes that might improve the Committee's communication of its assessment of the economic situation.Vincent R.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.\\t\\tThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period August 12, 2003, through September 15, 2003.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had been picking up in recent months, although the data were not uniformly positive.  Domestic final demand had strengthened appreciably, with solid gains in both household and business spending. While industrial production was growing, job losses continued.  Inventories were again drawn down.  Consumer prices had edged up in recent months, but year-over-year consumer inflation remained at a very low level.Private nonfarm payroll employment fell again in August, with a decline similar to those in June and July.  Employment continued to fall in the manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, transportation and utilities, and information categories.  Employment in the service industry was about unchanged as job losses in professional and business services largely offset expansion in non-business services.  Growth in construction employment continued.  Aggregate hours of private production workers edged down in August, reflecting the employment declines, while the average workweek was unchanged.  The unemployment rate fell to 6.1 percent in August. Industrial production posted a solid increase in July after no change in June.  Data available for August suggested increased output at utilities, reflecting abnormally hot weather, but little net change in manufacturing.  Overall capacity utilization rose in July, led by the increase in utility production.Retail sales rose a bit further in August after surging in July.  Real personal consumption spending advanced briskly through July (latest data) as all major categories of outlays recorded increases.  Real disposable income rose substantially in July largely because of the reduction in tax withholdings and the delivery of advance refund checks relating to higher childcare deductions.  The further delivery of such checks in August was expected to have a positive effect on spending in that month as well.  Although the index of consumer sentiment ticked down in August and early September, it remained well above its March low.Housing construction and sales remained very strong in July.  Single-family housing starts rose a bit further from the record level in June, while multifamily housing starts were unchanged. Sales of existing homes were up sharply in July, and new home sales remained robust but were off slightly from their rapid June advance.Data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods in July suggested that the upward trend in real business outlays for equipment and software had carried into the third quarter.  Total shipments of nondefense capital goods rose moderately in July, with continued notable strength in computers and peripheral equipment. Shipments of communications equipment were off only slightly in July after a surge in June.  Orders for nondefense capital goods overall were little changed in July.  A drop in nonresidential construction expenditures in July reversed the gains made in the second quarter, with declines in all categories except non-office commercial structures.Inventories contracted in the second quarter, and partial data for July suggested that the runoff continued into the third quarter.  The book value of manufacturing inventories declined for the month, led by stocks of durable goods.  However, inventories of wholesale goods edged up.  Inventory shipment ratios for the manufacturing sector at book value moved down considerably in July, and book value inventory-sales ratios for wholesalers remained at very low levels by historical standards.The U.S. international trade deficit edged down in June as exports of goods and services increased and imports were unchanged.  For the major foreign industrial countries, economic data for the second quarter were mixed.  While real GDP grew strongly in Japan and growth picked up in the United Kingdom, real GDP edged down in Canada and the euro area.Core consumer prices rose slightly less in August than in July. Both consumer food and energy prices rose somewhat faster than the core components, leaving the overall consumer inflation rate in August slightly higher than in July. Over the twelve-month period ending in August, overall consumer prices were up a bit from the previous year, while core consumer prices decelerated.  After significant declines during the second quarter, overall producer prices edged up in July and rose a bit further in August.  Core producer prices, however, were little changed for the two months and posted only a slight increase over the twelve-month period.  With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls ticked up in August.  The twelve-month change in average hourly earnings was about the same as that in the previous year.At its meeting on August 12, 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate at around 1 percent.  In reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters to be roughly equal; however, they viewed the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation as exceeding that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The Committee judged that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low would remain the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In those circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be maintained for a considerable period.The Committee\\'s decision to leave its target for the federal funds rate and assessment of risks unchanged at the August meeting was widely anticipated.  On net over the intermeeting period, market expectations for the federal funds rate changed little.  However, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates were volatile over the period, with yields on Treasury coupons declining slightly on balance.  Yields on most investment-grade securities moved in line with those on Treasury obligations, but a more optimistic economic outlook among investors contributed to a substantial decline in speculative-grade yields.  Broad stock price indexes rose notably, boosted by improved economic growth prospects and the associated upwardly revised expectations for earnings.On balance, the nominal value of the dollar changed little on a broad trade-weighted basis over the intermeeting period.  Optimism about global recovery reportedly prompted gains in the equity markets of major industrial countries.  Benchmark government bond yields rose in most foreign industrial economies.M2 grew briskly again in August, boosted by the effects of mortgage refinancing activity, a temporary bulge in liquid deposits caused by payment delays related to power outages, and tax rebate disbursements.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest a substantially stronger economic expansion than had occurred earlier in the year. Accommodative financial conditions, recent additional fiscal stimulus, and robust gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus to business and consumer spending over the months ahead. Concurrently, household expenditures, buoyed by recent tax cuts, were expected to be well maintained. Inventory levels had been substantially reduced, and the size of business capital stocks apparently had continued to move closer to acceptable levels. As a consequence, improving sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to boost business investment spending over time. Given the substantial ongoing slack in resource utilization, some slight downward pressure on core consumer price inflation was anticipated in the staff forecast. In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members focused both on the increased evidence of a pickup in the pace of the expansion and on the persisting weakness in labor markets.  The advance in economic activity in recent months reflected continued strength in household spending, reinforced by an increasing contribution from business investment expenditures. The members viewed these and related developments as supporting forecasts of robust  growth in economic activity over coming quarters, consistent with the stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, accommodative conditions in financial markets, and the positive implications of strong productivity growth for both incomes and investment outlays. Members nonetheless cited a number of factors that had the potential to retard the expansion, including the persistence of notably cautious business sentiment, the potential that weak employment conditions, should they persist, would at some point depress consumer spending, and the prospect that sluggish economic activity abroad would curb the growth in U.S. exports.  On balance, the members saw favorable prospects for strong economic growth over the forecast horizon, though they also expected that the gap between actual output and potential output would close only slowly and that growth in employment would remain limited.  Against this background and taking into account the outlook for continued strength in productivity, members anticipated that inflation would remain subdued and perhaps even edge lower despite the expected strength in economic activity.In their comments about developments in various parts of the country, members cited increased examples of an upturn in confidence among their business contacts. This improvement was not universal, notably within manufacturing sectors of the economy, and overall business attitudes toward hiring and investment decisions continued to be described as exceptionally cautious. Members anticipated, however, that such business attitudes would give way to optimism at some point, possibly quite suddenly, as uncertainties relating to the outlook for final demand were replaced by concerns about missing profit opportunities in a strengthening expansion. Comments by many contacts in the banking sector were already quite upbeat with regard to the outlook for business spending and optimism in financial markets clearly had been improving for several months.  In general, financial markets were viewed as well positioned to support more vigorous expansion in economic activity. In their comments about prospective developments in the major components of aggregate demand, members anticipated that the household sector would remain the mainstay of the expansion and that it would be significantly reinforced going forward by an acceleration in business expenditures and, at least over the next several quarters, by substantial further increases in federal government spending. Some softening in motor vehicle sales from the exceptional pace in recent months seemed likely, but overall consumer spending probably would be sustained at a high level by further anticipated gains in disposable incomes bolstered by the stimulus from recent federal tax cuts.  A potential negative in this outlook was the possibility that weakness in employment, if it continued, would at some point exert a more pronounced negative effect on consumer sentiment. In the housing area, residential sales and construction stayed at elevated levels during the summer months, with at least some portion of the strength reportedly stemming from efforts by many homebuyers to move ahead of further increases in mortgage interest rates.  The run-up in mortgage rates since the latter part of June was expected to curb housing demand to a limited extent in coming months, but the outlook for housing activity remained favorable, given an overall economic performance in line with current forecasts of a robust expansion, related growth in incomes, and still relatively attractive mortgage interest rates.Business fixed investment remained a critical factor and also a major source of uncertainty in the outlook for overall economic activity, with the strength of such investment having a key bearing on the pace of the overall expansion.  In this regard, the second-quarter increase in expenditures for equipment and software was an encouraging sign and the available evidence pointed to a larger advance in the third quarter. Looking beyond the near term, members mentioned a number of developments that supported an optimistic outlook for capital expenditures.  These included an appreciable acceleration in final sales since the first quarter, sizable increases in business profits and cash flow this year, the ready availability of business financing on attractive terms, and the temporarily accelerated expensing provision in the tax code. On the constraining side were the persistence of high levels of excess capacity and significant business uncertainty and caution regarding the extent and durability of the acceleration in final sales. To date, businesses had displayed only limited signs of undertaking any investments other than for replacement and cost-cutting purposes. Even so, the recent firming of orders and shipments along with somewhat more upbeat anecdotal reports and surveys of business spending plans pointed to a relatively brisk further advance in business spending for equipment and software, at least over the near term. Nonresidential construction activity remained at a generally depressed level but appeared to have bottomed out, with signs of an upturn in new or planned construction in some areas. Increasing business inventory expenditures to accommodate strengthening final sales were seen as a likely positive factor in the expansion of overall economic activity in coming quarters, though the degree and timing of the impetus from a prospective buildup in inventories were subject to considerable uncertainty. Pointing to anticipated strength in inventory accumulation was the substantial drawdown in stocks that had occurred as final sales picked up this year, a marked resulting drop in inventory-sales ratios, and expectations of accelerating final demand. At the same time, however, the persistence of business uncertainty and related caution were, with some exceptions, continuing to inhibit inventory investment. Moreover, the trend toward improved communication and delivery systems was encouraging business firms to hold inventories at increasingly low levels in relation to expected sales. According to anecdotal reports, even service firms were now increasingly adopting advanced management techniques to hold down their inventories of items used in the process of providing their services. Against this background, it seemed unlikely that businesses would seek to rebuild their inventories sufficiently to restore earlier inventory-sales ratios. Even so, further increases in sales would eventually lead to improved business confidence and induce efforts to accumulate inventories, though probably to a lesser extent than had occurred in earlier cyclical recoveries.Fiscal policy was likely to remain a key source of stimulus to the expansion. Federal spending was expected to increase substantially further, albeit at a diminishing pace over the next year and beyond, and reduced taxes should buoy both consumer and business expenditures. It was not clear at this point to what extent the partial expensing provision was boosting business investment in equipment and software, but the high level of consumer spending clearly was playing a role in fostering such investment. Members commented that the current degree of fiscal stimulus was at its highest level since the World War II period, and some expressed concern in this regard that little legislative consideration was being given to reapplying fiscal restraint as changing economic conditions would warrant over time. The fiscal condition of many state and local governments remained severely stressed, and ongoing efforts by these governments to curb spending and increase tax and other revenues provided a partial offset to the federal sector stimulus. Some members reported, however, that tax receipts recently had improved noticeably in a number of states. In their comments about the outlook for the foreign sector of the economy, members referred to indications of some overall improvement in foreign economic activity, which augured well for the growth in exports.  They also noted that the prospective performance of foreign economies would depend to a significant extent on the strength of the U.S. economy. With the latter displaying relative vigor, the value of domestic imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a substantial margin, thereby tending to perpetuate the large current account deficits that had worrisome implications for the future.  Members also expressed concern about indications of growing protectionism, which characteristically tended to increase in periods of substantial underutilization of labor and other resources, and the adverse effects of that development on competition and inflation. The members agreed that inflation was likely to remain subdued for an extended period, given current forecasts of economic activity and labor productivity trends. Specific views regarding the most probable course of inflation differed to some degree, but many members expected little change over the year ahead and even beyond. Several saw a significant risk of some further disinflation over that period even assuming economic growth at a pace that somewhat exceeded the economy\\'s long-run potential.  In this regard, members referred to their expectations that the gap between actual and potential output was likely to narrow only slowly and possibly not close completely over their forecast horizon. They also noted that the substantial margins of excess capacity in question likely would continue to characterize the international as well as the domestic economy for a considerable period. Tending to counter the resulting disinflationary effects were signs that the expansion in globalization might be slowing.  In particular, difficulties in reaching global trade agreements along with a rise in protectionism could tend to inhibit the increasingly strong competition in worldwide markets that had been a key factor in holding down inflation. The members also cited other factors that would tend to maintain some upward pressure on prices, notably the relatively rapid rise in costs of labor benefits, especially medical and pension benefits.  Increases in the prices of some raw materials were also noted.  In general, the members concluded that the economy would need to grow at a pace above potential for a time before they could be confident that the risks of further unwelcome disinflation had materially diminished. In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance involving reserve conditions consistent with a target rate of 1 percent for the federal funds rate. The members agreed that despite the increasing evidence of some acceleration in the expansion of economic activity, an accommodative policy stance remained appropriate in the context of the currently large and persisting margins of unemployed labor and other resources and very low inflation. Several commented that the recent strengthening of the economy had served to alleviate but had not eliminated their concerns about the possibility of further disinflation. While both downside and upside risks continued to cloud the outlook for economic activity and thus for monetary policy, the economy\\'s sizable output gap strongly suggested that inflation would remain muted over coming quarters even assuming relatively robust economic growth in line with current forecasts. Accordingly, the economy might well expand at a brisk pace for an extended period before inflationary pressures began to emerge and call for an adjustment to monetary policy. In their discussion of the press statement to be issued shortly after this meeting, the members indicated that the Committee\\'s risk assessments relating to economic activity and inflation to be referenced in that statement should remain the same as those in use since the May meeting.  In particular, the risks to the goal of sustainable economic growth were about balanced for the next few quarters and the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation, though minor, exceeded that of a rise in inflation from its currently low level. On balance, the risk of undesirably low inflation was likely to be the Committee\\'s predominant concern for the foreseeable future.          The members also reviewed the further use of the reference concerning the maintenance of an accommodative policy stance \"for a considerable period\" that was included in the press statement issued for the August meeting. Given the uncertainties that characteristically surround the economic outlook and the need for an appropriate policy response to changing economic conditions, the members generally agreed that the Committee should not usually commit itself to a particular policy stance over some pre-established, extended time frame. The course of policy would be determined by the evaluation of the outlook, not the passage of time.  The unusual configuration of already low interest rates and reservations about the strength of the expansion had justified the inclusion of the phrase \"for a considerable period\" in the statement issued in August. While changing circumstances would call for removal of that reference at some point, doing so at this meeting might suggest the members\\' views on the economy had changed markedly.  Accordingly, the Committee decided to release a statement after this meeting that was virtually identical to that used after the August meeting apart from some minor updating to reflect ongoing economic developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, Parry, and Stewart. (Mr. Stewart voted as an alternate member.)    Votes against this action: None.             The vote encompassed the substance of the following statements concerning risks that would be conveyed in the Committee\\'s press release to be made available shortly after the meeting:The risks to the Committee\\'s outlook for sustainable economic growth over the next several quarters are balanced; the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next several quarters are weighted toward the downside; and, taken together, the balance of risks to its objectives is weighted toward the downside in the foreseeable future.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, October 28, 2003.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.\\t\\tThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period September 16, 2003, through October 27, 2003.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  The pace of the economic expansion appeared to have picked up substantially.  Consumer spending and the demand for housing were quite strong in the third quarter and business outlays for capital evidently accelerated.  At the same time, labor markets seemed to be leveling out, and industrial production had firmed in recent months.  While core consumer prices had risen faster in recent months than earlier in the year, the twelve-month increase through September was notably lower than during the preceding year. Labor markets appeared to be stabilizing as private nonfarm payrolls grew in September for the first time since January, and employment losses in July and August turned out to be smaller than data initially had indicated.  The largest employment gain in September was in the business services sector, which includes temporary help supply firms.  Employment also increased in most other major industries in September, with the exceptions of manufacturing and wholesale trade.  Even in these sectors, the pace of job loss was somewhat slower than the declines of previous months. Aggregate hours of private production workers and the average workweek were both unchanged in September.  The unemployment rate in September remained at 6.1 percent.Conditions in the industrial sector had improved somewhat in the previous months.  Industrial output displayed solid growth in the third quarter after declining earlier in the year.  A downturn in motor vehicle assemblies depressed overall manufacturing somewhat in August, but a step-up in auto production boosted it significantly in September.  The strength in manufacturing in September was somewhat offset, however, by a decrease in energy production as temperatures returned to more normal ranges after being unusually high in July and August.  In line with these patterns in output, capacity utilization in manufacturing, which had been at historically low levels, decreased slightly in August, then firmed in September. Real personal consumption expenditures surged in July and August, but available data suggested that consumer spending had fallen back in September, largely reflecting a swing in consumer purchases of motor vehicles.  Even apart from motor vehicles, outlays rose at a solid pace in August, and they seemed to have declined only slightly in September.  Spending was supported in recent months by the sizable boost to disposable personal income from tax cuts as well as by levels of wealth and confidence that were considerably above their values earlier in the year.Housing construction and sales remained very strong in August and September despite some rise in mortgage rates from the very low levels reached in the early summer.  The rapid pace of new single-family home construction eased slightly in August but advanced again in September.  Multifamily home construction remained around its pace of the past several years.  Sales of existing homes reached a record high in August and then climbed further in September.  New home sales rose in August and September at a rate just a bit below the record set in June.Real outlays for equipment and software in the third quarter appeared to have advanced at a faster rate than in the second quarter.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft moved up in September, more than reversing a decline in August.  Orders for these goods rose moderately in September after being flat in August.  Nominal outlays for construction of privately owned buildings were about unchanged, on net, during the twelve months ending in August.  Continued strength in the construction of private institutional structures such as schools, churches, and hospitals was about offset by weakness in other areas of nonresidential construction.Manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles fell further in August after edging down in July.  Manufacturers ran off stocks at a fairly rapid pace in both months, while wholesalers and retailers excluding motor vehicle and parts dealers recorded small declines in stocks in August after accumulations in July.  Generally small changes in shipments and sales in the July-August period kept book-value inventory-sales ratios about flat at very low levels.The U.S. international trade deficit declined in August to its lowest level since February as imports fell more than exports.  Available data for the third quarter generally suggested moderate growth in the major foreign industrial countries. Evidence pointed to a likely resumption of real GDP growth in the third quarter in Canada and the euro area and continued expansion in Japan and the United Kingdom.Core consumer prices rose slightly in August and September, but headline consumer inflation was up a bit more, largely reflecting a run-up in gasoline prices.  Energy prices also boosted overall consumer inflation over the past twelve months, while core consumer inflation moved lower over the same period.  At the producer level, core prices were about unchanged during August and September, but rising energy and food prices led to somewhat larger increases in the prices of total finished goods.  With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls edged down in September.  The increase in earnings during the previous twelve months was a bit below that during the previous year.At its meeting on September 16, 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate at around 1 percent. In reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters to be roughly equal; however, they viewed the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation as exceeding that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The Committee judged that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low would remain the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In those circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be maintained for a considerable period.The Committee's decision to leave its target for the federal funds rate and assessment of risks unchanged at the September meeting was widely anticipated.  Although there was relatively little shift in market expectations for the federal funds rate following the policy decision, longer-dated federal funds futures rates rose significantly in the weeks before the October meeting in the context of better-than-expected economic data, positive announcements of corporate earnings, and a pronounced weakening of the dollar.  Short- and intermediate-term Treasury yields also increased somewhat over the intermeeting period, but yields on longer-term Treasuries were about unchanged.  While rates on investment-grade securities moved about in line with those on Treasuries, yields and spreads on lower-tier obligations registered further significant and broad-based declines.  Major equity indexes rose roughly 2 percent over the intermeeting period.The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies index, fell significantly over the intermeeting period.  Negative market sentiment toward the dollar, apparently reinforced by market participants' interpretation of the G-7 communiqué from Dubai on September 20, was not overcome by several better-than-expected U.S. economic reports, though there were some short-lived gains related to the data releases during the period. M2 contracted moderately in September after growing rapidly in July and August.  The reversal appears to have stemmed mainly from a contraction in deposits resulting from reduced mortgage refinancing activity.  In addition, the temporary effects of a major power blackout in August had boosted M2 growth in that month, and the subsequent runoff of those deposits likely depressed M2 in September.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to point to a substantial strengthening in the economic expansion during the second half of the year. Accommodative financial conditions, recent additional fiscal stimulus, and robust gains in structural productivity were evidently providing significant impetus to business and consumer spending. Inventory levels had been substantially reduced, and the size of business capital stocks apparently had continued to move closer to acceptable levels. As a consequence, improving sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were projected to boost business investment spending over time. Given the substantial ongoing slack in resource utilization, the staff forecast anticipated some slight downward pressure on core consumer price inflation.In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to widespread indications of a marked strengthening in the growth of economic activity. While views regarding the probable vigor of the expansion differed to some extent, the members generally anticipated growth at a pace near or somewhat above the economy's potential over the forecast horizon, assuming no major shocks to the economy. Factors cited as likely to encourage robust and sustained economic growth included substantial fiscal and monetary policy stimulus, accommodative financial conditions, indications of strengthening foreign economies, much improved business earnings and cash flows, and the favorable implications of strongly rising productivity for business investment and worker earnings. Members nonetheless saw some factors that could restrain the degree of vigor in household and business spending and present downside risks to their forecasts. Among the negatives mentioned were the still-cautious business attitudes that continued to inhibit hiring and investment decisions, the potentially adverse effect on household confidence if appreciable further gains in employment should fail to materialize, and the waning impetus over time of the tax reductions that had taken effect this year. On balance, while the factors pointing to a vigorous expansion seemed to predominate, members acknowledged that the economy was emerging from an atypical period that limited the guidance that historical experience provided for evaluating the economic outlook.  Developments in the next few months, notably including the strength of holiday sales, should provide an improved basis for judging the underlying momentum of the expansion. In contrast to the usual experience in economic recoveries during recent decades, the expansion appeared to be gathering momentum at a time when key measures of inflation suggested that price stability had essentially been achieved. Looking ahead, members generally anticipated that an economic performance in line with their expectations would not entirely eliminate currently large margins of unemployed labor and other resources until perhaps the latter part of 2005 or even later.  Accordingly and given the presumed persistence of strong worldwide competition, significant inflationary pressures were not seen as likely.Members commented that the strengthening in final sales had fostered some firming in industrial production and had led purchasing managers to report an improvement in current and anticipated business conditions. Moreover, labor demand had begun to show signs of stabilizing after an extended period of weakness. Anecdotal reports of plans to increase hiring and of actual increases had multiplied. However, the extent to which recently positive labor market developments might be harbingers of substantial further employment gains was unclear at this point, given evidently continuing business efforts to respond to growing demand by improving productivity rather than hiring new workers. Members nonetheless expressed optimism regarding the prospects for substantial employment gains once business firms were persuaded that a major uptrend in final sales was firmly established.          In their comments about the outlook for demand in key sectors of the economy, members continued to view business capital spending as a critical factor in the prospects for the performance of the overall economy. Business expenditures for new equipment and software clearly had turned up since earlier in the year, but anecdotal reports from around the nation continued to suggest that much of this spending was for replacement and upgrading purposes rather than expansion.  Such reports also indicated that business contacts, while more confident, remained  very cautious, with most firms hesitant to expand their facilities or hire permanent workers until they saw firmer indications that the recent upturn in business activity would be sustained. Some firms reportedly were directing capital investments to foreign markets rather than domestically, apparently largely to take advantage of lower labor costs abroad. Members nonetheless expressed the view that in the context of further anticipated increases in profits and sales, business confidence would continue to improve and induce greater investment and workforce expansions. On the negative side, there were few indications of a possible upturn in commercial construction activity.     The recent strength in final sales was associated with sizable inventory liquidation by business firms, and recent surveys and anecdotal commentary suggested that inventories were at unusually low levels in relation to sales, notably in manufacturing. In the circumstances, a continuation of robust final demand could be expected to foster efforts to rebuild inventories, with potentially substantial short-run stimulus to the economy. However, the timing and extent of such restocking were subject to uncertainty, and for now available reports indicated that business firms were continuing to follow a highly cautious approach to inventory investment.As had been true for an extended period, household spending had continued to be the mainstay of what until recent months had been a sluggish economic recovery. Personal consumption expenditures had posted quarterly increases throughout the recent period of limited economic growth. During the summer months, consumer spending evidently was boosted by a surge of disposable income generated by the federal tax cuts, but how long that income effect would stimulate increases in consumer spending remained uncertain. On the encouraging side, according to a number of reports retailers were optimistic about the outlook for sales during the holiday period and about the economy more generally. However, some members expressed concern that unless the recent improvement in labor market conditions was sustained, there could be adverse repercussions on consumer attitudes and spending.   Propelled by still low mortgage interest rates, housing demand had remained at a very high level in recent months. Indeed, record sales were being reported in some regions. There were, however, indications of concern about the longer-term outlook for housing on the part of some real estate contacts.Fiscal policy was expected to be somewhat less expansionary next year, though still an important contributor to economic growth.  Members again mentioned concerns on the part of business contacts regarding the adverse economic implications of very large deficits for the economy over the longer term. In their comments about the external sector of the economy, members referred to indications of strengthening economic activity abroad that in conjunction with a weaker dollar was fostering some improvement in exports.  At the same time, imports continued to expand rapidly, reflecting not only growth in U.S. domestic demand but also the increased availability of foreign products at attractive prices stemming from the rapid expansion of output capacity in a number of foreign countries. In this regard, many business contacts continued to note pressures on their domestic operations from foreign competition. In their review of the outlook for inflation, members emphasized that the prospects for persisting slack in labor and other resources in combination with substantial further increases in productivity were likely to hold inflation to very low levels over the next year or two. Indeed, many saw modest further disinflation as likely, at least over the year ahead, though they also agreed that the probability of substantial and worrisome disinflation had become increasingly remote in light of the recent strengthening in economic activity. Members also cited the weakness in the dollar as a factor that would tend to reduce the degree of any domestic disinflation. Some members emphasized that the outlook for inflation was clouded by a high degree of uncertainty about the underlying trend in productivity. The growth in productivity could remain higher than had earlier been anticipated, damping employment, labor costs, and price pressures. On balance, the members did not view changes in inflation in either direction as likely to generate significant policy concerns over the forecast horizon.  In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members agreed that an unchanged target of 1 percent remained appropriate for the federal funds rate. The current degree of policy ease evidently was contributing to an upturn in the expansion of economic activity. The strengthening economy had reduced concerns of significant further disinflation, but those concerns had not been eliminated. The pickup in demand had yet to materially narrow currently wide margins of idle labor and other resources, and these margins along with the uncertainties that still surrounded current forecasts of robust economic growth suggested that an accommodative monetary policy might remain desirable for a considerable period of time. Members referred to the contrast between their current policy expectations and the typical experience during earlier cyclical upturns when it was felt that policy adjustments needed to be made quite promptly to gain greater assurance that inflation would not rise from what were already relatively elevated levels. In present circumstances, the degree of slack in resources and a rate of inflation that was essentially consistent with price stability suggested that the Committee could wait for more definitive signs that economic expansion would otherwise generate inflationary pressures before making a significant adjustment to its current policy stance.In their discussion of the press statement to be issued shortly after this meeting, the members indicated that the Committee's risk assessments relating to economic activity and inflation to be referenced in that statement should remain the same as those in use since the May meeting.  Some members, while expressing support for this view, also commented that the time for some changes in the current risk assessments might be approaching if the economy continued to strengthen in line with recent experience. At this meeting, the members agreed that the risks to the goal of sustainable economic growth were roughly balanced for the next few quarters and the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation, though minor, exceeded that of a rise in inflation from its currently low level. On balance, the risk of undesirably low inflation was likely to remain the Committee's predominant concern for the foreseeable future. At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee agreed to the release of a press statement after this meeting that was virtually identical to the one used after the September meeting apart from some updating to reflect ongoing economic developments. The Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in  the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn, Moskow, Olson, Parry, and Stewart. (Mr. Stewart voted as an alternate member.)    Votes against this action: None.              The vote encompassed the substance of the following statements concerning risks that would be conveyed in the Committee's press release to be made available shortly after the meeting:The risks to the Committee's outlook for sustainable economic growth over the next several quarters are balanced; the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next several quarters are weighted toward the downside; and, taken together, the balance of risks to its objectives is weighted toward the downside in the foreseeable future.At this meeting the members continued their earlier discussion of how best to communicate the Committee's general assessment of the outlook for economic activity and inflation. The members recognized that changing circumstances required adaptations in the Committee's communications with the ultimate objective of fostering the best possible public understanding of monetary policy decisions. A number of alternative approaches and specific suggestions were discussed, and in the absence of a consensus at this meeting the members agreed that further study under the guidance of a working group comprised of Committee members was desirable. The working group would develop a limited number of specific proposals for consideration at a later meeting.    It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, December 9, 2003.   The meeting adjourned at 2:00 p.m.Vincent R.

Advice had been received that Mr. Timothy F. Geithner had been elected         by the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a member of         the Federal Open Market Committee for the period commencing November 14,         2003, and ending December 31, 2003, and that he had executed his oath         of office.       By unanimous vote, Timothy F. Geithner was elected to serve as Vice Chairman         until the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee after December         31, 2003, with the understanding that in the event of the discontinuance         of his official connection with a Federal Reserve Bank or the Board of         Governors, he would cease to have any official connection to the Committee.       The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments         in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign         currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.       The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets         and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities         issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period October         28, 2003, through December 8, 2003. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified         these transactions.       Real GDP appeared to be advancing at a solid rate in the fourth quarter,         albeit well below its extraordinary pace in the third quarter. Consumer         spending appeared to be on a flatter trajectory, but spending for equipment         and software and residential construction continued to surge. Meanwhile,         the labor market had finally shown signs of some improvement in recent         months, and activity in the industrial sector was continuing to rise.         Consumer price inflation remained quiescent: The twelve-month change in         core consumer prices was notably lower than the increase during the preceding         year.       Private nonfarm payrolls rose moderately in November, although by less         than the substantial gains in September and October. The increases in         November were fairly widespread, with notable advances in temporary help         services, nonbusiness services, and construction. Although employment         continued to fall in manufacturing, the losses had tapered off since the         first half of the year. The average workweek and aggregate hours worked         by nonfarm employees increased significantly, and the average level of         nonfarm employee hours in October and November was noticeably above the         average in the third quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent         in November, down from a recent peak of 6.4 percent at midyear.       Industrial production grew solidly in the third quarter, and the momentum         continued in October apart from the production of motor vehicles and parts,         which fell back from an elevated third-quarter level. High-tech output         accelerated in the third quarter to the fastest pace since the middle         of 2000, and production gains continued at a rapid pace in October. Outside         the manufacturing sector, unseasonably warm weather contributed to an         increase in output at utilities in October, while mining production declined         a bit, largely reflecting a decrease in the production of crude oil. Capacity         utilization edged up in October but remained well below its longer-term         average.       Consumer spending slipped a little on balance in September and October         after soaring in July and August. Much of the recent decline was the result         of a pullback in purchases of motor vehicles; elsewhere, expenditures         were about unchanged in September and rose modestly in October. Spending         was supported by the upturn in employment, continued impetus from the         recently enacted tax cuts, improved confidence, and a level of wealth         that was considerably above that of earlier in the year.       Housing activity surged in October. Single-family housing starts reached         a record high, while multifamily starts moved down but remained in line         with the average pace during the previous two years. Sales of existing         single-family homes in October were only a bit below the record level         set in September. The pace of new home sales also remained brisk in October,         albeit down somewhat from September.       The data on orders for, and shipments of, nondefense capital goods through         October suggested continued momentum in spending on equipment and software,         which grew in the third quarter at the fastest pace since 1998. Robust         gains in spending were posted in the third quarter in all the major categories         except aircraft. The gains were associated with recent increases in business         output and corporate cash flow and with a decline this year in the user         cost of capital. Shipments of high-tech equipment climbed further in October,         while shipments in other nondefense sectors excluding aircraft edged down.         New orders of nondefense equipment excluding aircraft in October continued         the upward trend in place since the beginning of the year and were consistent         with ongoing gains in equipment spending. Outlays for the construction         of private-sector nonresidential buildings fell a bit in October, but         the extended contraction in spending on nonresidential construction appeared         to be ending. Nominal spending on office space edged up in September and         October, while outlays for the construction of other commercial buildings         moved lower. Expenditures on institutional buildings changed little in         recent months.       Real nonfarm inventories fell moderately in the third quarter after declining         substantially in the second. Manufacturers liquidated stocks by a larger         amount in the third quarter than in the previous quarter but added slightly         to their inventories in October. Wholesalers and retailers (excluding         those selling motor vehicles and parts) built up inventories in the third         quarter, and, for wholesalers, the stockbuilding continued in October         (data on retail inventories in October were unavailable). Still, inventory-sales         ratios in all three categories declined a bit further in the third quarter         from already very low levels.       The international trade deficit increased in September as imports of         goods and services rose more than exports. Recent data suggested that         a recovery had taken hold in the major foreign industrial countries. Growth         in real GDP picked up in the third quarter in the euro area, the United         Kingdom, and Canada, and indicators in Japan were consistent with continued         economic expansion.       Core consumer price inflation remained subdued in October, although it         was up from even lower levels in the first part of the year, when it was         depressed by transitory factors. Over the twelve months ending in October,         core consumer prices rose only slightly and noticeably less than in the         previous twelve-month period. Total twelve-month consumer inflation was         unchanged over the period owing to accelerations in food and energy prices.         Producer prices for both core and total finished goods posted unusually         large increases in October, reflecting in part a sizable advance in the         prices of motor vehicles. Twelve-month core producer price inflation,         however, was on balance unchanged over the year ending October, although         the twelve-month change in overall producer prices stood well above its         year-earlier level owing to a jump in food and energy price inflation.         With regard to labor costs, the average hourly earnings of production         or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose slightly in         the twelve months ending in November; the increase was a bit below that         in the previous twelve months. By contrast, the increase in the employment         cost index for hourly compensation in private industry for the twelve         months ending in September was a bit higher than a year earlier, reflecting         a pickup in benefit costs.       At its meeting of October 28, 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee         adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve         markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate at around 1 percent.         In reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the         upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for         the next few quarters to be roughly equal; however, they viewed the probability,         though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation as exceeding that of a         rise in inflation from its already low level. The Committee judged that,         on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remained the         predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In those circumstances,         the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be maintained for         a considerable period.       The Committee\\'s decision at the October meeting to leave its target for         the federal funds rate unchanged had been widely anticipated, and rates         on near-dated federal funds futures were virtually unchanged. However,         the Committee\\'s retention of both an unchanged risk assessment and its         indication that policy could remain accommodative for a considerable period,         which market participants apparently had seen as less certain outcomes,         precipitated a brief rally in Treasury markets. Over the intermeeting         period as a whole, intermediate- and longer-term Treasury yields were         basically unchanged. Upward movements in response to data releases showing         an economy building momentum were offset by the market response to several         statements by policymakers reiterating that policy could remain accommodative         and to the November employment report, which included a smaller gain in         private nonfarm payrolls than market participants had expected. Yields         on investment-grade corporate securities were also essentially unchanged,         while yields on speculative-grade securities declined, continuing the         narrowing of their risk spreads. Major equity indexes were up moderately         over the intermeeting period.       The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies         index, declined somewhat, on net, over the intermeeting period. The dollar         had appreciated in late October and early November following several stronger-than-expected         U.S. economic data releases. But the dollar depreciated, on net, over         the remainder of the intermeeting period, reflecting concerns about an         escalation of trade frictions prompted by the U.S. imposition of import         quotas on Chinese textiles, the ability of the United States to continue         to finance its current account deficit, and risks stemming from developments         in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Turkey.       M2 contracted significantly in November for the third consecutive month.         A sizable part of the declines in these three months appeared to be due         to the falloff in mortgage refinancing activity and the resulting reductions         in associated deposit balances. In addition, rising equity markets may         have made M2 accounts relatively less attractive.       The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the economic         expansion was likely to be sufficiently robust to reduce economic slack         substantially in coming quarters. Accommodative financial conditions,         fiscal stimulus, and substantial gains in structural productivity would         continue to provide significant impetus to business and consumer spending         over the months ahead. In addition, businesses appeared to be shedding         some of the caution that had characterized their behavior for the previous         three years. As a consequence, with sales, profits, and stock prices higher,         the liquidation of inventories appeared to be ending, and the strengthening         of capital investment and pickup in hiring already evident in the data         were projected to continue. Even though the unemployment rate was projected         to decline over coming quarters, some slight downward pressure on core         consumer price inflation was anticipated in the forecast, given ongoing         slack in resource utilization.       In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective economic developments,         members referred to widespread indications that the pickup in the economic         expansion was broadening and becoming more entrenched. The members noted         that spending by households had remained strong even as the effects of         tax cuts and mortgage refinancing began to wane. And with business confidence         on the mend, investment outlays had increased rapidly and employment had         revived. While assessments by individual members of the likely pace of         the expansion going forward differed somewhat, they generally expected         growth to run at a rate that would trim slack in labor and goods markets         over the forecast period, assuming no major shocks to the economy. Factors         supporting this view included stimulative monetary and fiscal policies,         accommodative conditions in financial markets, building business confidence,         a rebound in profits, and the effects on the external sector of the weaker         dollar and pickup in growth abroad. While downside risks to the outlook         had diminished, some members remained concerned that spending could slow         somewhat next year as the effects of fiscal stimulus and mortgage refinancing         faded. Rapid productivity growth also could limit employment gains and         so weigh on consumer confidence. With relatively strong economic growth         nonetheless seemingly more assured, members regarded the risks to inflation         as more nearly balanced than earlier in the year.       In their comments about recent developments around the nation, members         reported improving economic conditions in virtually all regions, with         strength in household spending increasingly augmented by gains in business         outlays. Consumer spending remained firm, and residential construction         continued at a high level. Committee members\\' business contacts generally         expressed increasing confidence that the expansion would be sustained,         and they anticipated further increases in investment outlays and employment         going forward. Even in manufacturing, which had lagged the recovery in         the rest of the economy until recently, output was rising in many subsectors         and employment displayed signs of stabilizing. Some members reported an         easing of downward pressures on prices in selected industries, but anecdotal         reports suggested that competition, including especially competition from         foreign producers, continued to constrain pricing.       In their comments about the outlook for demand in key sectors of the         economy, members indicated greater confidence that the sizable gains in         business spending in recent quarters would continue. It now appeared that         the increase in outlays for equipment and software in the third quarter         was even larger than had been thought, and data on orders and shipments,         as well as anecdotal reports, pointed to further increases. These gains         owed to rising business confidence, substantial gains in profits and cash         flow, and accommodative financial markets. In addition, businesses were         expected to step up investment outlays next year in advance of the expiration         of temporary tax incentives. Some members noted that the commercial real         estate sector, which had been very weak with high vacancy rates and falling         rents, was showing signs of bottoming, as the strengthening economy boosted         demand for office and retail space.       An easing of business caution was also suggested by growing indications         that business firms were shifting from inventory liquidation to restocking.         With the level of inventories still quite low relative to sales and sales         expected to strengthen further, a number of members noted that inventory         investment could be expected to contribute to growth in aggregate demand         in coming quarters.       Household spending had remained solid even as the effects of tax refunds         and mortgage refinancing, which had boosted spending substantially in         the summer, waned. While consumption spending had slowed earlier in the         fall, retail contacts suggested some strengthening more recently and reported         that holiday sales appeared to be running somewhat above last year\\'s pace.         Looking forward, members anticipated that consumer spending would be supported         by further gains in employment as well as by substantial tax refunds in         the first half of next year. And with the expansion picking up momentum,         the risk of a slowdown in such spending clearly seemed to have diminished.         Some members pointed, however, to signs of increased financial stress         that could limit the ability of many households to hold spending at recent         levels, especially if incomes did not rise at a robust pace in line with         current forecasts. In the housing sector, activity remained elevated despite         some increase in mortgage rates since early summer.       Members anticipated that growth in federal government spending, which         had been boosted in recent quarters by a buildup in defense outlays, would         slow going forward, while budget pressures would continue to limit increases         in state and local spending. Although fiscal policy more generally would         probably continue to strengthen aggregate demand next year, this effect         was expected to diminish somewhat even though very large deficits were         likely to persist. Over a longer horizon, some members expressed concern         about the possible adverse effects of such deficits on financial markets         and the economy.       In their remarks about the external sector of the economy, members noted         that an improvement in the economic outlook in many foreign economies,         as well as the lower dollar, was likely to foster a pickup in exports.         While some of the improvement abroad was probably the result of faster         growth in the United States, domestic demand in several major trading         partners appeared to be strengthening. Nonetheless, the value of U.S.         imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a wide margin,         and the resulting large current account deficits and their potential correction         added to uncertainty about the longer-term prospects for the U.S. economy.       In their review of the outlook for prices, members generally anticipated         that persisting, though decreasing, margins of slack in labor and goods         markets and further gains in productivity would keep inflation low, with         a number of members seeing a small further decline in inflation as a distinct         possibility. Even if growth proved fairly robust, downward pressure on         prices could come from a narrowing of profit margins, which were currently         quite high, or from further surprising strength in productivity, which         would reduce labor costs. In addition, some members noted that the current         unemployment rate likely understated the slack in labor markets, since         the labor market participation rate had fallen significantly of late,         and changes in payment and hiring practices had perhaps reduced the level         of unemployment that could be sustained without upward pressure on wages.         However, with growth now seen as more assured, downward risks to inflation         were viewed as considerably reduced relative to earlier in the year, and         the risk of a pernicious deflation in which declining prices reinforced         weakness in demand - a risk that the members had always viewed as small         - was now regarded by most as virtually nil. Indeed, the weaker dollar,         higher commodity prices, and outsized increases in benefit costs were         seen as suggesting some countervailing upward pressure on costs and prices         even though changes in exchange rates and commodity prices generally had         not had a large effect on retail prices in the past. Members also expressed         concern about the potential for an increase in inflation expectations         given highly stimulative macroeconomic policies and economic growth that         seemed to be gathering momentum. Some noted that the rise in recent months         in inflation compensation, as measured by the difference between the yields         on nominal and indexed Treasury securities, could potentially point in         this direction. Nonetheless, on balance, most members currently considered         the upside risks to inflation to be a bit less pressing than those on         the downside for the next few quarters.       In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead,         all the members favored an unchanged policy that continued to incorporate         a target of 1 percent for the federal funds rate. The data and anecdotal         evidence becoming available since the last meeting had made the members         more confident that robust growth in economic activity would persist.         Nonetheless, they felt that the currently accommodative policy stance         remained appropriate in a period characterized by very low inflation,         wide margins of unused labor and other resources, and still considerable         uncertainty about the speed with which those margins would be worked down.         In these circumstances, inflationary pressures appeared likely to remain         subdued well into the future. To be sure, the Committee needed to remain         attentive to any indications of rising inflation pressures and to be prepared         to adjust its policy stance if emerging economic conditions warranted         such a move. At some point, a move in the direction of a less accommodative         and more neutral policy posture might well be necessary should the apparently         vigorous expansion continue and over time promote fuller utilization of         resources. For the near term, however, members saw substantial benefit         in maintaining an unchanged policy stance and considerable risk in taking         preemptive action that could prove to be unneeded against potential inflation,         with associated costs to economic performance.       In their discussion of the announcement to be issued shortly after this         meeting, the members agreed that in addition to updating to reflect recent         economic developments, some rewording was needed to reflect their evolving         assessment of the risks to the economy. In light of the recent acceleration         in economic activity and their expectations of relatively robust growth         ahead, the members believed that the clearest way to convey their changed         assessment was to note that the risks of substantial disinflation had         diminished appreciably. While a number of members saw some slight further         disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material         change in inflation. All could agree that the risks of further disinflation         were substantially reduced and close to balance for overall inflation.         In the circumstances, most members endorsed a proposal to delete as no         longer necessary the previous summary statement relating to the risks         to growth and inflation taken together.       Views differed with regard to the reference in recent statements to maintaining         an accommodative monetary policy \"for a considerable period.\" A number         of members argued that its deletion would serve to enhance the Committee\\'s         flexibility to adjust monetary policy at a later date when that was deemed         appropriate on the basis of evolving economic circumstances. A majority,         however, preferred to retain the phrase, at least for now. They noted         that the changes in their assessment of risk would convey the evolving         views of the Committee and they believed the \"considerable period\" reference         still accurately conveyed the Committee\\'s policy intentions. Given the         decision to retain the reference in question, all the members saw merit         in associating it more clearly with economic conditions, specifically         the persistence of quite low inflation and slack in resource use, as opposed         to having it appear to be linked only to the passage of time.       At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize         and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed         otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance         with the following domestic policy directive.       \"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions           that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.           To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future           seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the           federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.\" The vote encompassed the following statements concerning the risks to         the Committee\\'s outlook for economic growth and inflation. These statements         would be included in the press release to be made available shortly after         the meeting.       The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment           of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. The           probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent           months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.         Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Geithner,           Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Broaddus, Ferguson, Gramlich, Guynn, Kohn,           Moskow, Olson, and Parry. Vote against this action: None. At this meeting Mr. Ferguson reported on the progress of the working         group that was charged at the October 28 meeting with developing some         specific proposals regarding how best to communicate the Committee\\'s assessment         of the outlook for economic activity and inflation. The working group         had solicited and received comments from the members of the Board of Governors         and from the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks regarding potential         approaches for improving communications with the public and enhancing         thereby the latter\\'s understanding of monetary policy decisions. It was         agreed that the working group, with the assistance of staff at the Board         of Governors and the Federal Reserve Banks, would prepare more detailed         proposals together with supporting staff documentation for consideration         at a later meeting of the Committee.       It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on         Tuesday- Wednesday, January 27-28, 2004.       The meeting adjourned at 2:00 p.m.       Vincent R.

By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations         was amended in the form shown below. AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS 1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal         Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most         recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee: (a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities         of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations         of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of         the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and         foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank         of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System         Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange         maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury         or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement;         provided that the aggregate amount of U.S. Government and Federal agency         securities held in such Account (including forward commitments) at the         close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action         is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not be increased         or decreased by more than $12.0 billion during the period commencing with         the opening of business on the day following such a meeting and ending         with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting; (b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations         of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of         the United States, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve         Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities or         obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise         expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive         bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements         with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities         or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by         the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall         be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account. (c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct         obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any         agency of the United States to dealers for System Open Market Account         under agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations         in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly         authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding,         after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with         individual dealers. 2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations,         the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank         of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S. Government securities held         in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be determined         by competitive bidding. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set         a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and         apply reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue that         may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each dealer may         borrow. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could         facilitate a dealer\\'s ability to control a single issue as determined         solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations,         while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign         and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New         York and accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as         fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal         Reserve Act, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs         the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account,         to sell U.S. Government securities to such accounts on the bases set forth         in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts         of those securities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to         those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York         Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to         the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph         l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities,         and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its         own account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agency accounts         maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under         the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate. 4. In the execution of the Committee’s decision regarding policy         during any intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the         Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman         of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the         degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal         funds rate. Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee’s         discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s         long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth,         and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during         the intermeeting period. Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman,         if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any adjustment.The amendment to the authorization for domestic open market operations         involved the addition of a reference in paragraph 3 to accounts held at         the Federal Reserve Bank of New York pursuant to fiscal agency instructions         from the Secretary of the Treasury. Accounts listed in paragraph 3, which         include those maintained by the Bank on behalf of official foreign and         international accounts, are eligible for participation in the Bank’s         short-term investment facility, the so-called “repo pool.”                 By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations was         reaffirmed in the form shown below. AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS 1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal         Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent         necessary to carry out the Committee\\'s foreign currency directive and         express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity         with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time         to time: A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form         of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market         at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Treasury, with         the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the         Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the         Bank for International Settlements, and with other international financial         institutions: Canadian dollars        Danish kroner        Euro        Pounds sterling        Japanese yen        Mexican pesos        Norwegian kroner        Swedish kronor        Swiss francs B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to         receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above. C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars         under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below,         provided that drawings by either party to any such arrangement shall be         fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that         time was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances,         specifically authorizes a delay. D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not         exceeding $25.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open position in         all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net         positions in individual currencies. The net position in a single foreign         currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding         contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery         of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to         sign. 2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank         of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (\"swap\"         arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum         of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated         by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section         214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with         the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity:Foreign bankAmount of arrangement            (millions of dollars equivalent) Bank of Canada2,000Bank of Mexico3,000Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed         terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred         for review and approval to the Committee. 3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph         1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee,         be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of providing an investment         return on System holdings of foreign currencies or for the purpose of         adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings,         transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-market         exchange rates. 4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks         for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In making operating         arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign         currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself         to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open         Market Committee. Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration         of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with         the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5         of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee. 5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate         liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency         portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18         months (calculated as Macaulay duration). When appropriate in connection         with arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency         holdings, U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign central         banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar         days. 6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall         be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee.         The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman         of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such         other member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence         of members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board members         designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice         Chairman of the Committee, his alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee         shall be called at the request of any member, or at the request of the         Manager, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), for the purposes         of reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with         the Manager on other matters relating to his responsibilities. At the         request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such         reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal         Open Market Committee. 7. The Chairman is authorized: A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement         or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division         of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and         the Treasury; B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System         foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary on policy         matters relating to foreign currency operations; C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information         to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial         Policies. 8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent         information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials         of the Treasury Department. 9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency         operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the         Board of Governors\\' Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships         of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944. By unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive was reaffirmed in         the form shown below. FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE 1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed         at countering disorderly         market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar         reflect actions and         behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1. 2. To achieve this end the System shall: A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign exchange. B. Maintain reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with         selected foreign central banks. C. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other countries         and with international         monetary institutions. 3. Transactions may also be undertaken: A. To adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies. B. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular         currencies,         and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. C. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the Committee. 4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted: A. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the United         States Treasury; B. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary authorities;         and C. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United States         in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange arrangements under         IMF Article IV. By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign         Currency Operations were reaffirmed in the form shown below.PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO        FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction         of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the Authorization         for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the         Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, System Open Market         Account (\"Manager\"), shall be guided by the following procedural         understandings with respect to consultations and clearances with the Committee,         the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee.         All operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported         promptly to the Committee. 1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman,         if the Chairman        believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the         time available): A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s overall         open position in foreign        currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the         most recent regular         meeting of the Committee. B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the System\\'s         net position in a         single foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the         operation is         associated with repayment of swap drawings. C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading         in a particular currency by         the System, even though the change in the System\\'s net position in that         currency might be         less than the limits specified in 1.B. D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger         of (i) $200 million         or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement. 2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the Subcommittee,         if the Subcommittee         believes that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible in         the time available, or with         the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee         is not feasible         in the time available): A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s overall         open position in foreign         currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting         of the Committee. B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger         of (i) $200 million or         (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement. 3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman         about proposed swap         drawings by the System and about any operations that are not of a routine         character.On January 9, 2004, the continuing rules, regulations, and other instructions         of the Committee had been distributed with the advice that, in accordance         with procedures approved by the Committee, they were being called to the         Committee\\'s attention before the January 27-28 organization meeting to         give members an opportunity to raise any questions they might have concerning         them. Members were asked to indicate if they wished to have any of the         instruments in question placed on the agenda for consideration at this         meeting, and no requests for consideration were received. Accordingly,         all of these instruments remained in effect in their existing form.  The Committee considered a report from the Manager of the System Open         Market Account that discussed the feasibility and costs of purchasing         mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage         Association (GNMA), a federal government agency. A potential advantage         of transactions in such GNMA obligations was their use to supplement purchases         of direct Treasury securities in periods when large federal surpluses         reduced market supplies of Treasury debt. However, the resumption of large         federal deficits had led to sizable increases in market supplies of Treasury         obligations, which members saw as the preferred vehicle to supply the         need for permanent additions to the System Open Market Account. The report         concluded that outright transactions in mortgage-backed GNMA securities         were feasible but would involve sizeable start-up costs and would tend         to complicate the conduct of System open market operations. Against this         background the Committee decided not to initiate outright transactions         in mortgage-backed GNMA obligations. It was understood, however, that         such GNMA obligations would continue to be eligible as collateral for         System repurchase agreements.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market         Committee held on December 9, 2003, were approved. The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments         in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign         currencies for the        System\\'s Account in the period since the previous meeting.The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets         and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal         agency obligations during the period December 9, 2003 to January 27, 2004.         By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions. At this meeting the Committee engaged in a broad-ranging discussion         of its communication practices.  A portion of this discussion focused on the report of a working group         that had been directed to study how the Committee’s announcements         might be improved. In the course of the discussion, members stressed the         importance that they attached to conveying clearly to the public information         regarding the reasons for policy decisions and how those decisions related         to the Committee’s longer-term objectives. However, only limited         support emerged for the use of particular standard wording to express         the Committee’s appraisals of the economic outlook and views about         the balance of risks. Indeed, several members were in favor of discontinuing         the use of statements regarding the balance of risks to the outlook and         instead focusing mostly on the reasons for their policy decisions in the         announcement. At the same time, all the members indicated that they could         support a flexible approach in which the wording of the Committee’s         announcements, including the assessment of the balance of risks going         forward, would be adjusted gradually over time in keeping with evolving         economic conditions. In further discussion the members reviewed the potential value and drawbacks         of accelerating the publication of Committee minutes. Possible benefits         would include the provision of more complete information sooner after         meetings on the considerations that led the Committee to adopt the current         stance of policy. Some members expressed concern, however, that accelerated         release of the minutes might have the potential to feed back adversely         on the deliberations of the Committee and on the minutes themselves. The         members also emphasized the importance of allowing sufficient time for         them to review and comment on the minutes and for reconciling differences         of opinion among the members of a large and geographically dispersed committee.         At the conclusion of this discussion, staff was asked to study the issue         further. The members also discussed the possible advantages of making some changes         in the content, time horizon, and frequency of the individual forecasts         that are summarized in the semi-annual Monetary Policy Reports to the         Congress. In general, the members saw little to be gained by altering         the Committee’s current practices in any significant way, although         some proposed relatively minor changes. It was agreed that there was no         need to reach a decision on such changes at this time, but staff was instructed         to ascertain the degree of interest on the part of the members in making         possible minor adjustments to current procedures.  The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and         the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period. The economy appeared to have expanded at a robust pace in the fourth         quarter, though well below the exceptional pace recorded in the third         quarter. Consumer spending continued to increase at a solid rate over         the final three months of the year, and activity in the residential sector         remained at a very high level. On the business side, outlays for equipment         and software likely posted moderate gains in the fourth quarter, and firms         apparently accumulated inventories for the first time in three quarters.         Despite the strong pace of economic activity, the labor market was improving         only slowly, with private payrolls showing a small acceleration in the         fourth quarter. Core consumer price inflation continued to slow, and inflation         expectations remained subdued over the closing months of 2003.  The December employment report suggested that the labor market had not         gained as much momentum as previously appeared to be under way. Private         nonfarm payrolls increased only slightly in that month, and their level         in November was revised down appreciably. The average monthly increase         in employment in the fourth quarter was indicative of a fairly weak recovery         in the labor market, although it was a clear improvement over the average         monthly loss during the first half of the year. Manufacturing payrolls         continued to shrink in December at about the same pace as in the previous         few months, and holiday-related hiring in retail trade was below average.         In other sectors, job gains were recorded in construction, education and         health services, and professional and business services. Average weekly         hours of production or nonsupervisory workers declined somewhat in December,         reversing the gains of the previous two months. Aggregate hours worked         by nonfarm employees fell in December but in the fourth quarter as a whole         posted their first quarterly increase since 2000. Despite the weak payroll         data, the unemployment rate, which is measured by the household survey,         fell to 5.7 percent in December, in part because of a further decline         in the labor force participation rate. Initial claims for unemployment         insurance continued to drift down in the weeks following the reference         week for the December employment report, suggesting improved job growth         in January. The pace of expansion in the industrial sector picked up in the fourth         quarter. Total industrial production rose at the fastest rate since the         second quarter of 2002, and manufacturing production posted solid and         widespread gains. High-tech industries, including those producing semiconductors,         computers, and communications equipment, accounted for nearly one-third         of the increase in total industrial production in the fourth quarter.         After having surged in the third quarter, the production of motor vehicles         and parts moved up in the fourth quarter at about the same rate as overall         manufacturing. Outside the manufacturing sector, output at mines increased         modestly in the quarter, while output at utilities rose appreciably, led         by a solid advance in electricity generation that mirrored the strengthening         in the manufacturing sector. Capacity utilization was unchanged in December         and remained well below its long-term average. Sales of light vehicles jumped in December, and the fourth-quarter average,         although below the torrid third-quarter pace, was well above that recorded         for the first half of the year. These data, along with those on retail         sales excluding autos, were consistent with a solid increase in real personal         consumption expenditures in the fourth quarter. Real disposable personal         income advanced smartly in November. Spending was also supported by the         recent stock market gains, and by greater consumer confidence as reflected         in the Michigan Survey Research Center’s index of consumer sentiment         and the Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence, both of         which stood significantly above their average readings for 2003.  Activity in the housing market remained very robust. In December, single-family         starts edged down only a bit from the exceptional rate they had reached         in November, and multifamily starts moved up to the highest level in almost         four years. New home sales declined in November for the third consecutive         month, but they were still not far below the record highs registered earlier         in the year. Existing home sales had fallen back from September’s         high, though the level in November was still noticeably higher than average         monthly sales in the first half of 2003.  The available data suggested that business purchases of transportation         equipment strengthened in the fourth quarter and that spending on other         capital goods advanced at a moderate pace. Business expenditures on aircraft         rebounded noticeably in the fourth quarter, albeit to a level that was         still far below the levels that prevailed before the downturn following         the terrorist attacks in 2001. Both fleet sales of light vehicles and         truck sales also rose significantly. In the high-tech sector, real outlays         for computing equipment and for software again appeared to have posted         sizable increases in the fourth quarter, while spending on communications         equipment was little changed after three quarters of double-digit growth.         Outside transportation and high tech, nominal shipments were about unchanged         in the fourth quarter, but the upward trend in orders established since         the beginning of last year was consistent with further gains in spending.         After holding roughly steady, on balance, in the first half of 2003, real         spending on private nonresidential construction appeared to have slipped         further in the third and fourth quarters. In the commercial and health-care         sector and in the manufacturing sector, average nominal outlays in October         and November were about unchanged from the previous quarter. However,         spending on other types of construction moved down. The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor         vehicles posted the third consecutive significant monthly increase in         November. Stocks at manufacturers were down a little on average in October         and November, but non-auto wholesalers and retailers accumulated inventories         at a brisk pace. Strong increases in sales, however, kept book-value inventory-sales         ratios at or near their recent lows. Motor vehicle and parts inventories         ended the year noticeably above the level at the end of the third quarter.        The international trade deficit in November shrank to its lowest level         in about a year. Exports of goods and services increased to a level not         recorded since early 2001, while imports fell moderately. Recent data         indicated that the pickup in economic activity in the major foreign industrial         countries continued in the fourth quarter. Japanese exports, machinery         orders, and industrial production rose strongly in October and November.         Euro-area manufacturing data exhibited increasing strength, particularly         in Germany. In the United Kingdom, indicators of business and retail sales         in December pointed to a maintained expansion. And Canadian employment         and sales data were strong in the fourth quarter, with the housing sector         continuing to make a significant contribution to growth.  Prices of consumer goods and services other than food and energy continued         to decelerate through the end of 2003. Overall consumer prices were flat,         on balance, over the past three months, as a small increase in core prices         and a large rise in food prices were offset by a sizable drop in energy         prices. Over the year, the consumer price index posted a moderate increase         that was noticeably below that in the previous year. Core consumer prices         decelerated more sharply and rose only slightly over the year. Producer         prices for finished goods were up moderately over the year, and the advance         was substantially above that over the previous year. The rise last year         was due almost entirely to substantial increases in food and energy prices         as core producer prices rose only a little after having edged down over         2002. With regard to labor costs, the average hourly earnings of production         or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose modestly in         the twelve months ending in December, an increase somewhat below that         over 2002.  At its meeting on December 9, 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee         (FOMC) adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve         markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate at around 1 percent.         In reaching this decision, the Committee members generally perceived the         upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for         the next few quarters to be roughly equal. They also judged that the probability         of an unwelcome fall in inflation had diminished in recent months and         now appeared almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. Nevertheless,         with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believed         that policy accommodation could be maintained for a considerable period. The Committee’s decision at the December meeting to keep its target         for the federal funds rate at 1 percent appeared to have been fully anticipated         in financial markets, and interest rate futures for the first half of         2004 were essentially unchanged after the announcement. But futures rates         for the second half of the year rose a few basis points, presumably in         response to the Committee’s assessment that the probability of an         unwelcome decline in inflation had fallen in recent months to a level         almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. Subsequently, however, the         release of the minutes for the October FOMC meeting, which indicated that         at that time the Committee was concerned about the possibility of persistent         slack arising from rapid productivity growth, and the publication of surprisingly         modest growth in employment in December led most market participants to         push back the date of the expected onset of tightening by several months         to some time in the fall. Reflecting the change in policy expectations,         intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treasury yields declined substantially         over the intermeeting period. Yields on inflation-indexed debt fell by         nearly as much, suggesting that the drop in nominal yields owed more to         lower real interest rates than to reduced inflation compensation. Yields         on investment-grade and most speculative-grade securities moved down by         about the same amount as Treasury yields. Major equity indexes rose strongly         in response to the declines in yields and positive news about the outlook         for profits.  The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies         index, declined moderately on net over the intermeeting period. Ongoing         investor concerns about the ability of the United States to finance its         current account deficit reportedly were again a primary factor exerting         pressure on the dollar. M2 fell in December, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. The decline         in M2 over the fourth quarter was the largest on record since the start         of consistent data collection in 1959. The weakness was concentrated in         liquid deposits and, to a lesser extent, in retail money market mutual         funds and appeared to be due in large part to the unwinding of a previous         buildup in deposits associated with heavy mortgage refinancing activity         and to portfolio shifts by households into equities.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the momentum         in economic activity that had built up in the second half of 2003 would         carry over into the first half of the current year and that the ongoing         gains in spending and production would soon result in a more visible improvement         in labor market conditions. The considerable stimulus being provided by         fiscal and monetary policies was expected to keep aggregate demand on         a solid uptrend. In addition, improving labor market conditions and the         effects of strong productivity growth on permanent income were projected         to support household spending, while business investment spending was         seen as strengthening in response to the acceleration in business output,         swelling profits, and continued favorable financing conditions. Some slight         downward pressure on core consumer price inflation was anticipated in         the forecast given the ongoing slack in labor and product markets. In the Committee’s discussion of current and prospective economic         developments, the members commented that the information that had become         available since the December meeting had tended to validate their earlier         assessment that the expansion was firmly established and that robust economic         growth, under way since about mid 2003, was likely to continue as the         year progressed. Many emphasized that business expenditures now appeared         to be on a solid upward trajectory amid widespread reports of much improved         business sentiment. Indeed, business expenditures had broadened the sources         of significant strength in the expansion, which earlier had been sustained         mainly by household and government spending. Factors underlying a favorable         outlook for economic activity continued to include stimulative fiscal         and monetary policies, accommodative conditions in financial markets,         and the positive effects of a strong uptrend in productivity on business         investment incentives and, with some lag, on household incomes. The members         nonetheless expressed disappointment that the acceleration in economic         activity had thus far failed to generate significant strengthening in         employment, though they pointed to a number of positive signs in labor         markets. Given their expectations of persisting above-trend economic growth,         they saw increasing demand for workers as a likely prospect going forward.         Regarding the outlook for inflation, members observed that wide margins         of slack in labor and product markets continued to hold down wages and         prices, especially given the concurrent strength in productivity. Core         consumer inflation appeared to have drifted lower recently, and a number         of members mentioned the possibility of a modest further decline in such         inflation from its current subdued level. Over the year ahead, however,         the members generally anticipated little net change in consumer price         inflation. In keeping with the practice at meetings preceding the Federal Reserve’s         semi-annual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy,         the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal         Reserve Banks had provided individual projections of the growth of GDP,         the rate of unemployment, and consumer price inflation for the year 2004.         The forecasts pointed to a continuation of relatively vigorous growth         in economic activity, some further decline in unemployment, and a quite         low rate of inflation. Specifically, the forecasts of the expansion in         real GDP between the fourth quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of         2004 had a central tendency of 4-1/2 to 5 percent and a full range of         4 to 5-1/2 percent. The projections of the civilian unemployment rate         in the fourth quarter of 2004 were all in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent.         Forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the         PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1 to 1-1/4 percent,         with a full range of 1 to 1-1/2 percent.  In their discussion of developments across the nation, members emphasized         growing indications of rising business confidence and, despite persisting         softness in a number of industries, more widespread signs of increasing         business spending for equipment and software and for inventories. The         members cited a variety of factors that pointed to a further pickup in         business capital expenditures over the coming year, including the strength         in new orders and shipments, increasing profits and cash flow, the improved         financial condition of many business firms, the general availability of         financing on favorable terms, and the temporary tax incentive on expenditures         for new equipment. Anecdotal reports from business contacts about capital         spending plans were indicative of appreciable further acceleration in         business expenditures on a widening range of capital goods. While many         contacts indicated that replacement demand or the cost-saving opportunities         provided by more productive new equipment were still the driving factors         in guiding investment decisions, there were more reports of investment         spending to expand capacity.  The members also viewed business inventory investment as likely to provide         some support to the economic expansion over the year ahead. Business inventories         were at exceptionally low levels in relation to sales, and if further         brisk growth in demand broadly in line with current forecasts materialized         this year, business firms could be expected to make commensurate additions         to their inventories. Indeed, inventories appeared to have turned up in         the fourth quarter after declining on balance earlier in 2003 as businesses         evidently became more confident that increases in their sales would be         sustained.  While business expenditures had turned up, employers had continued to         display a high degree of caution in hiring new workers. Employment had         trended up since mid-2003 after a protracted period of job losses, but         the gains were significantly weaker than was typical at similar stages         of earlier business cycles. A key factor that had tended to hold down         hiring was the continuing ability of business firms to meet increasing         demand by improving productivity with existing workforces rather than         hiring new workers. Against this background, labor markets continued to         be described as soft in most areas, albeit with more signs of at least         modest improvement. In this regard, members referred to positive developments         such as the decline in initial claims and the rise in aggregate hours         worked in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, the members saw considerably         faster growth in employment as a likely prospect in the context of further         strengthening in aggregate demand and expectations of some slowing in         the growth of productivity from its extraordinary pace in recent quarters.         Several emphasized, however, that the timing and extent of the improvement         in employment were subject to considerable uncertainty.  The household sector was continuing to supply major impetus to the expansion.         Household spending was benefiting from stimulative fiscal and monetary         policies, the wealth effects of rising real estate and equity prices,         and increased consumer confidence about the economic outlook. Members         noted that retailers in many parts of the country reported solid sales         during the holiday period. With respect to the outlook for overall consumer         spending, it was suggested that the elevated growth of productivity could         be expected to raise incomes over time and thereby help to buttress consumption         even as the stimulus from earlier tax cuts faded. Residential construction         activity remained at a high level, evidently supported in part by recent         declines in mortgage interest rates. Contacts in the housing industry         indicated that they expected a high level of construction activity in         2004, though perhaps not as robust as in 2003. Fiscal policy was providing considerable stimulus to the economy and         would continue to do so in the first part of this year, reflecting the         large tax refunds anticipated as a result of overwithholdings in 2003.         Beyond the nearer term, however, the fiscal stimulus was projected to         diminish under existing legislation. In this regard, one member questioned         whether a robust expansion would be sustained once the fiscal impulse         was removed. Some members expressed concern about the longer-run prospects         for large federal deficits and their implications for the future performance         of the economy. In their comments about the international economy, members noted that         the strengthening in economic activity abroad and the decline in the foreign         exchange value of the dollar had boosted exports. Even so, the ongoing         strength in imports was still producing a widening trade deficit, and         net exports were expected to be a small arithmetic drag on domestic economic         activity over the year ahead. Some members indicated that they were concerned         about the implications of the nation’s rapidly growing external         debt for domestic financial markets and the economy over time. In the Committee’s discussion of the outlook for inflation, the         members agreed that increases in core consumer prices were likely to remain         muted this year, with ongoing strength in the expansion only gradually         reducing the current output gap and anticipated gains in productivity         exerting downward pressure on costs and prices. Some members commented,         however, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was         quite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain.         Accordingly, while members agreed that changes in core consumer price         inflation were likely to be limited, there was some divergence of opinion         about the most probable direction. In the view of many, some modest further         disinflation appeared to be the most likely prospect. A few members noted         that such disinflation, if it was associated with rapid growth in productivity,         could be viewed as non-threatening. Moreover, the expected strength in         aggregate demand would curb the extent of disinflation over time. A few         members expressed the differing view that core consumer prices might well         edge up over the course of the year in light of the considerable stimulus         stemming from current monetary and fiscal policies and the possibility         that the expected pickup in economic activity and employment, especially         if it were on the high side of current forecasts, would be associated         with slower growth in productivity. The evidence pointing to the possibility         of an uptick in inflation was still quite limited, but some members noted         that in addition to sizable advances in the prices of many commodities         including oil, reports from business contacts indicated that a few firms         had been able to raise their selling prices and maintain them at higher         levels in an effort to pass on increases in costs. Overall, however, the         pricing power of business firms remained quite limited.  In the Committee’s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period         ahead, all the members favored an unchanged policy stance that was directed         toward maintaining reserve conditions consistent with a target federal         funds rate of 1 percent. While the members were persuaded that a relatively         vigorous economic expansion was now firmly established and was likely         at some point to call for a move toward a more neutral policy stance,         they concluded that such an adjustment was not warranted under current         circumstances. In this regard they stressed that unused labor and other         resources remained substantial, that inflation was at a very low level,         and that inflation was not expected to change appreciably in either direction         over the year ahead. Members acknowledged that there were risks in maintaining         what might eventually prove to be an overly accommodative policy stance,         but for now they judged that it was desirable to take risks on the side         of assuring the rapid elimination of economic slack. With regard to the wording of the Committee’s press statement         to be released shortly after the meeting, members discussed at some length         the desirability of retaining a reference from earlier statements to the         prospect that an accommodative policy could be maintained “for a         considerable period.” The existing language had been explicitly         qualified at the December meeting by tying it to low inflation and slack         in resource use, thereby underscoring the notion that a move away from         the current degree of policy accommodation would depend on economic conditions         rather than simply on the passage of time. All the members agreed that         a change in wording was desirable, not to signal a policy tightening move         in the near term, but rather to increase the Committee’s flexibility         to take such an action when it was deemed to be desirable and to underline         that any such decision would be made on the basis of evolving economic         conditions. However, some differences of opinion arose with regard to         the specific proposal under consideration, namely to remove the reference         to “considerable period” and to substitute one referring to         “patience.” Those who fully endorsed the proposal believed         that the new wording conveyed important information about the Committee’s         strategy in an environment of price stability and economic slack and under         those circumstances was unlikely to have outsized effects in financial         markets. A number of members commented that expectations of sustained         policy accommodation appeared to have contributed to valuations in financial         markets that left little room for downside risks, and the change in wording         might prompt those markets to adjust more appropriately to changing economic         circumstances in the future. A few members, while expressing agreement         with respect to the merits of a language change, nonetheless preferred         to drop the reference to a “considerable period’’ entirely         without substituting a reference to the Committee’s ability to be         patient. In this view, even the replacement language would tend to shape         expectations in ways that could complicate the conduct of policy, and         with the economy in a strong uptrend, the Committee no longer needed to         utilize such special language.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Committee voted to authorize and         direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise,         to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following         domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions           that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.           To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future           seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the           federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.  The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in         the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the           attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly           equal. The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished           in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.           With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes           that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation. Votes for this action: Messrs.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.\\t\\tThe Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period January 28, 2004, through March 15, 2004.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace in early 2004.  Consumer spending growth appeared to have picked up somewhat, and activity in the housing market remained at high levels.  In the business sector, spending for equipment and software was apparently advancing vigorously, and firms were adding modestly to their inventories.  Still, the increases in economic activity had not yet generated sizable gains in employment.  Core consumer price inflation remained low, and expectations of future inflation continued to be subdued.The January and February employment reports depicted a labor market that was slow to pick up momentum.  The modest gains posted in private nonfarm payrolls over the period were smaller than had been expected by most forecasters.  Employment in the manufacturing sector, which had fallen continually for over three years, was essentially unchanged in February, while employment in other sectors showed mixed changes.  Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers edged above the average level of the fourth quarter of 2003.  Despite the weakness in employment, the unemployment rate in January and February came in below its fourth-quarter level.Industrial production moved up briskly in January and February following strong increases in the fourth quarter.  These gains in production were realized across a wide set of industries.  High-tech industries, including semiconductors, computers, and communications equipment, posted particularly strong advances, while the production of motor vehicles and the output of other manufacturing sectors were also strong.  Outside the manufacturing sector, power generation by utilities surged in January but fell back in February in response to outsized swings in average temperatures during those months.  Capacity utilization continued to move higher in January and February, although it remained below its longer-run average.Consumer spending growth in recent months appeared to pick up somewhat from its pace in the fourth quarter of 2003.  Retail sales rose briskly, on average, in January and February, and spending on services was up in January (the most recent month for which data were available).  In contrast, purchases of motor vehicles slipped in January and February from the strong pace in the fourth quarter.  Overall, expenditures were supported by sizable gains in real disposable personal income and increases in household wealth owing to rising home and equity prices.  Disposable income was boosted by significant growth in private wages and salaries and by a drop in taxes that was due to the lower final payments and higher refunds associated with last year\\'s tax cut.  Surveys indicated that consumer sentiment moved higher in January but subsequently fell back.  Despite the pullback, sentiment remained above the levels seen during most of 2003.Activity in the housing market moderated in January and February from its elevated pace in the fourth quarter.  Single-family housing starts and permits stepped down, although both measures remained above their average levels of the first three quarters of 2003.  Housing starts in the multifamily sector slipped only slightly from the fourth quarter pace, even though vacancy rates reached a record high level in the fourth quarter.  Sales of new and existing homes slowed in January, but this change retraced only a small part of the extraordinary run-up in home sales that began last spring.  Home prices continued to rise briskly.Spending on capital goods had advanced at a vigorous pace in the fourth quarter and appeared to be continuing that growth early this year.  Spending by businesses was supported by increases in their sales and the continuation of strong cash flows and a low user cost of capital.  Nominal shipments of computing and communication equipment moved up sharply in recent months, as did shipments outside the high-tech sector.  By contrast, business investment in transportation equipment was mixed.  Data for new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft suggested that the strength in capital expenditures would continue going forward.  As has been the case for some time, real spending on private nonresidential structures languished, and vacancies in industrial buildings and office properties were at high levels.Real nonfarm inventory investment remained modest in recent months.  Although manufacturers\\' inventories moved higher in January, that increase primarily reflected stockbuilding at producers of petroleum and coal products.  Retail inventories also rose in January, as stocks at auto dealers increased; wholesalers accumulated inventories at a modest pace.  Inventory-sales ratios in these sectors lingered at or near their historical lows.The U.S. international trade deficit rose to a record high level in January.  Exports of goods and services fell, owing importantly to a drop in agricultural exports.  Imports edged lower, with higher oil imports partly offsetting declines in most other categories.  Recent data suggested that economic activity in major foreign industrial countries strengthened outside the euro area, notably including a sizable jump in Japan\\'s output in the fourth quarter.  Growth in the euro area remained tepid.Core consumer price inflation stayed very low in early 2004.  Over the twelve months ending in January, the increase in core consumer prices was around 1 percent--about ¾ percentage point below the increase over the preceding twelve months.  Total consumer price inflation, however, was boosted in January by a surge in energy prices.  Incoming information on trends in labor costs were more mixed.  The average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose modestly over the twelve months ending in February, decelerating from its year-earlier pace.  By contrast, the employment cost index for hourly compensation in private industry grew a bit faster over the twelve months ending in December than over the year-earlier period.  At its meeting on January 27-28, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 percent.  The Committee also retained its assessment that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth were roughly equal as well as its judgment that the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation had diminished and was almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.  With inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee saw no need for tightening policy in the near future.  However, to provide additional flexibility to adjust monetary policy at a later date once such action was deemed appropriate given economic developments, the Committee removed from its post-meeting statement the explicit reference to a \"considerable period\" and substituted a statement that conveyed the sense that it could be patient in removing its policy accommodation.Although the Committee\\'s decision at the January meeting to keep the federal funds rate unchanged had been widely anticipated, the changes in the wording of the accompanying statement elicited a sharp reaction in financial markets.  Investors moved up the date when they expected policy tightening to commence, resulting in a jump in Treasury yields.  Over the balance of the intermeeting period, however, the Chairman\\'s testimony on monetary policy and data on nonfarm payroll employment with a weakish cast persuaded investors that policy tightening was still some ways off.  Treasury yields declined considerably in response and ended the intermeeting period lower, on balance.  Yields on inflation-indexed securities also fell, leaving measures of inflation compensation little changed. Yields on investment-grade bonds generally moved in tandem with those on Treasuries over the intermeeting period, but spreads on high-yield bonds widened as investors reassessed credit risks in light of the negative tone of some incoming economic data.  The disappointing employment data and renewed concerns about terrorism contributed to a decline in broad equity price indexes.  Technology-related issues, which had registered very large gains over the preceding year or so, fell more sharply.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies declined through the middle of February but subsequently rebounded to end the intermeeting period higher.After four consecutive months of decline, M2 rose slightly in January and accelerated markedly in February.  The effects of mortgage refinancing, which had depressed M2 growth in the second half of last year, appeared to wane, allowing the expansion in nominal income to show through to M2 growth.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that economic activity would continue to expand at a solid pace through 2005.  Monetary policy is expected to support growth over the projection period, and fiscal policy is anticipated to remain accommodative through 2004.  In addition, structural productivity growth is projected to remain substantial this year and next.  Strong advances in real disposable income were expected to keep consumer spending on a solid upward trajectory.  Business spending on equipment and software was seen as increasing briskly as a result of sizable profits, an improving outlook for demand, and continued favorable financing conditions.  Also, inventory investment was anticipated to rise gradually as businesses became more convinced that final demand was expanding along a sustainable track.  The pace of economic expansion was forecasted to be sufficient to reduce resource slack over this year and next, although the employment data received over the intermeeting period indicated that this process would begin from a higher rate of unused resources than had been previously expected.  Core inflation was projected to remain low over the forecast period.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members noted that overall economic activity still seemed to be increasing at a solid pace, though perhaps not quite as quickly as some members had anticipated at the time of the January meeting.  Investment spending had continued to advance, and the manufacturing sector, which had lagged the rest of the economy earlier in the expansion, had extended recent gains.  Residential construction activity was down somewhat from the very high levels posted late last year, but increases in household wealth and the effects of last year\\'s tax cuts continued to buoy consumer spending.  Despite the gains in spending and production, however, employment growth had been disappointing.  While job losses had moderated, hiring had yet to strengthen, holding down net increases in employment.  Nonetheless, the breadth of the expansion was seen as providing considerable assurance of its sustainability, and Committee members generally expected that accommodative monetary policy, favorable financial market conditions, and, at least in the near term, fiscal stimulus would continue to foster a pace of output growth that exceeded that of its potential.  Although economic slack likely would be declining, it was expected to be a little higher than previously had been anticipated.  Prices for energy, commodities, and non-oil imports were rising, however, and some business contacts had reported seeing a return of \"pricing power.\"  On balance, inflation was expected to remain near its current low level.      In their discussion of economic developments across the nation, a number of Committee members noted some slippage in business and consumer confidence from the high levels reached late last year.  While business contacts in some regions remained optimistic about prospects for their sales and planned to increase investment and, in some cases, employment, firms in other parts of the country had become somewhat more uncertain about the pace of the expansion going forward.  Those firms, as a result, were more wary about committing to new investment plans or increased hiring.  Financial markets also seemed a little less positive about the outlook, with stock prices lower and some risk spreads wider than at the time of the last meeting.  The reasons for the reduced optimism were not entirely clear but may have included higher energy and commodity prices as well as renewed concerns about terrorism.  Some members also pointed to the persistent weakness in employment, which might be seen as reducing the odds that household spending would continue to expand briskly once the stimulative effects of tax cuts waned.  Lingering business caution likely accounted for a good deal of the lag in job creation, but some members also pointed to a number of other factors that might be restraining hiring, including ongoing opportunities to increase efficiency through organizational changes and new investments, the effects on labor costs of increases in the costs of benefits, and, in some selected industries and regions, a shortage of job candidates with appropriate skills.  The extent and duration of the resulting restraint on hiring were difficult to assess, however, and the Committee continued to expect employment growth to pick up as the expansion progressed.In their comments about demand in key sectors of the economy, members indicated that investment spending had continued to expand at a robust pace.  Members anticipated vigorous growth in investment outlays going forward, supported by rapid productivity growth, high profits and cash flow, and accommodative financial markets.  Despite this generally upbeat assessment, a number of members reported that firms were investing primarily to replace old equipment or to reduce costs, but remained hesitant to expand capacity.  The commercial real estate sector remained weak, on balance, although some members suggested that market conditions were stabilizing and, in a few cases, even beginning to improve.  Committee members noted that activity in the housing sector, while still quite elevated, had fallen back from its extraordinary pace of late last year.  However, some of the moderation may have owed to the effects of severe winter weather rather than more lasting influences, and the recent decline in mortgage interest rates was expected to support the housing sector going forward.  Reports from some contacts suggested that speculative forces might be boosting housing demand in some parts of the country, with concomitant effects on prices, suggesting the possibility that house prices might be moving into the high end of the range that could be consistent with fundamentals.Consumer spending outside the auto sector had remained strong, with data and retail contacts generally suggesting continued growth in sales this year.  Committee members noted that sales had been bolstered by rising asset prices and the effects of last year\\'s tax cuts on refunds and final payments.  By contrast, sales of motor vehicles had fallen back noticeably, reflecting in part reductions in incentives.  However, members anticipated that sales would pick up again, partly in response to an anticipated rebound in incentives.  Looking forward, gains in employment and the pass-through of higher productivity to wages and salaries were also expected to boost consumer spending, even as the stimulus to growth from tax cuts faded and increases in home and equity prices likely slowed from their rapid pace in recent quarters.      The Committee anticipated that government spending would provide some further support for aggregate demand going forward.  The budget pressures that had constrained state and local government expenditures of late were easing in some cases, and federal outlays were expected to rise.  Fiscal policy was seen as providing less stimulus to aggregate demand in 2005 than this year, but the federal budget deficit was expected to remain substantial.             In their remarks concerning the external sector of the economy, members cited the decline in the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets since the middle of last year and stronger economic growth in many of our trading partners as factors boosting the demand for exports in a variety of industries.  While exports were likely to continue to advance, the value of U.S. imports was expected to rise as well, implying continued very large current account deficits.  Some Committee members noted that opportunities to cut costs had led some of their business contacts to consider moving production abroad.  In their review of the outlook for prices, members generally anticipated that core inflation would remain near current low levels, with output growth only gradually eliminating slack in labor and goods markets and strong growth in productivity limiting increases in unit labor costs.  Some members thought that core inflation had stabilized and was unlikely to move lower.  Increases in the prices of energy, other commodities, and non-oil imports, as well as reports from some business contacts that higher costs were increasingly being passed through to prices, suggested that the downtrend in inflation had ended.  Moreover, if, as some members thought likely, productivity growth slowed as employment picked up, the result could be reductions in slack accompanied by higher unit labor costs and associated pressures on prices.  Other members were less certain that inflation had leveled out.  Recent price trends were not clear, with some measures of core inflation still declining.  Increases in commodity prices remained limited to a few selected industries, and with the persistence of slack in labor and product markets, core inflation might well edge lower once any transitory influences had ebbed.  Moreover, if productivity were to expand at a rapid pace rather than slowing, unit labor costs could fall, putting downward pressure on prices.  In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all the members favored the retention of the current target rate of 1 percent for the federal funds rate.  This preference for an unaltered stance of policy was based on the absence of significant changes in economic conditions or in the members\\' basic assessment of the outlook since the January meeting.  To be sure, some of the incoming information--notably with regard to labor market developments--had been somewhat disappointing, but the Committee continued to see the conditions in place for further solid economic growth.  Similarly, despite the rise in energy and commodity prices and reports of increased pricing power in some sectors, many Committee members commented that persisting slack in labor and output markets would keep inflation low.  In these circumstances, the current accommodative stance of monetary policy remained appropriate.  Some members, while supporting an unchanged policy at this meeting, nonetheless emphasized that the maintenance of a very accommodative monetary policy over an extended period in concert with a stimulative fiscal policy called for careful attention to the possible emergence of inflationary pressures.  And, while adjustments in financial markets to low rates had generally been consistent with the usual operation of the monetary transmission mechanism, some members were concerned that keeping monetary policy stimulative for so long might be encouraging increased leverage and excessive risk-taking.  Such developments could heighten the potential for the emergence of financial and economic instability when policy tightening proved necessary in the future.  At present, however, the persistence of low inflation coupled with soft labor markets underscored the desirability of a monetary policy strategy characterized by continued patience.      In the Committee\\'s discussion of its statement to be released shortly after this meeting, the members saw merit in not changing the characterization of the risks to the outlook for inflation and economic activity.  Many members held that a case could be made for moving to a balanced risk assessment with regard to the outlook for inflation, with a number of them expressing a marginal preference for such a change.  However, other members thought the evidence for a balanced risk assessment was not yet compelling and pointed out that with inflation quite low and slack in labor and output markets likely to persist for a while longer, the costs to the economy associated with a further decline in inflation likely outweighed those associated with a comparable increase.  While many viewed it as a close call, all members indicated that they could support a proposal to retain the existing wording involving a slight tilt toward the possibility of some further disinflation.  The members also agreed on the desirability of retaining the assessment that the risks with regard to the outlook for economic growth were balanced.  Accordingly, it was agreed that the only changes in the post-meeting statement would be to update the descriptions of the economic expansion and labor market conditions in light of the information received over the intermeeting period.        At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive.\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the Committee\\'s statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal.

Tracy was elected to serve as associate economist until the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee after December 31, 2004, with the understanding that in the event of the discontinuance of his official connection with a Federal Reserve Bank or with the Board of Governors, he would cease to have any official connection with the Committee.  The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.By unanimous vote, the Committee voted to extend for one year beginning in mid-December 2004 the reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico.  The arrangement with the Bank of Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent and that with the Bank of Mexico in the amount of $3 billion equivalent.  Both arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve\\'s participation in the North American Framework Agreement.  The vote to renew the System\\'s participation in the swap arrangements maturing in December was taken at this meeting because of the provision that each party must provide six months prior notice of an intention to terminate its participation.The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period March 16, 2004, through May 3, 2004.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy expanded at a rapid pace in the first quarter.  Consumer spending and the housing market continued to exhibit strength.  Business fixed investment grew smartly, reflecting increased outlays for equipment and software that more than offset a significant fall in investment in nonresidential structures.  The labor market displayed further signs of improvement during the quarter, capped by a significant increase in private payrolls in March.  Recent increases in the prices of imports and commodities showed through to a pickup in core consumer price inflation during the first quarter, although some of the categories that registered large gains had posted unusually small increases earlier.The labor market showed renewed vigor during the first quarter.  The growth in payroll employment during March pushed the average monthly gain for the first quarter as a whole well above that of the fourth quarter of last year.  Hiring during the quarter was widespread across industries, with large increases in construction, retail trade, and business and nonbusiness services.  Net job losses in manufacturing, which had waned during the winter, reportedly came to an end by March.  Some surveys of business hiring intentions also suggested renewed strength.  However, a small decline in the average workweek during March held down the increase in aggregate hours, which rose at a slightly slower pace in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter.  Moreover, the unemployment rate ticked up to 5.7 percent in March, and the labor force participation rate remained low.Despite a weather-related decline in output at utilities during March, the pace of industrial production quickened during the first quarter, and the gains were widespread across industry and market groups.  The high-tech sector accounted for a significant part of the increase, as output of computers and semiconductors rose rapidly.  Production of other business equipment also increased markedly, and indexes for business and construction supplies were up notably.  Motor vehicle assemblies were slightly higher for the first quarter as a whole, although they slowed in March.  Manufacturing capacity utilization rose for the second consecutive quarter, but to a rate well below its long-run average.  Available weekly physical product data for April were up slightly.Real consumer spending grew at a somewhat faster pace in the first quarter than it had in the fourth quarter.  Retail sales rose briskly, with strength widespread across spending categories, while expenditures on services also posted a substantial increase.  Light vehicle sales were down slightly for the first quarter as a whole, but they firmed in March.  Solid growth in wages and salaries and an increase in tax refunds generated a large increase in real disposable personal income in the first quarter.  Measures of consumer confidence were roughly stable in March and April.Residential housing activity remained high in the first quarter despite a marked rise in mortgage interest rates.  Smoothing through weather-related swings in the volatile monthly data, the underlying pace of single-family housing starts continued to display appreciable strength.  Sales of new homes jumped to a record level in March, and sales of existing homes increased to their highest level since last September.  In the multifamily sector, construction activity also remained robust through March, even though the vacancy rate for multifamily units reached a record high in the first quarter.Business fixed investment continued to be supported by favorable underlying fundamentals, including increased corporate cash flow, a low user cost of capital, and, at least as judged by survey data, increased business confidence in the sustainability of the economic expansion.  Outlays for equipment and software expanded at a vigorous pace in the first quarter, with the exception of spending on transportation equipment.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were strong, especially outside the high-tech industries.  Within the high-tech sectors, rapid growth of shipments of communications equipment offset declines in the computers and peripherals category.  By contrast, investment in nonresidential structures fell considerably in the first quarter, and vacancy rates for industrial buildings and office properties remained high.Real nonfarm inventories increased a bit more in the first quarter than they had in the fourth quarter.  Motor vehicle inventories at the retail and wholesale levels accounted for the entire increase, while non-auto inventories ran off slightly.  In particular, manufacturers continued to reduce their stocks, though at a slower pace than last year.  Inventory accumulation lagged growth in sales and shipments, and the inventory-sales ratio edged down further.The U.S. international trade deficit shrank in February from January\\'s record high, with exports increasing across a range of major categories of goods.  Economic growth in the major industrialized countries in the first quarter was uneven.  The economies of Japan and the United Kingdom likely continued to expand, though at paces below those of late last year.  In the euro area, economic indicators were mixed.  A moderation of growth in Canada led the Bank of Canada to ease monetary policy for the third time this year, citing a need to support aggregate demand.  Inflation was little changed in Canada and the euro area, but it slipped further in the United Kingdom.  In Japan, consumer prices were about unchanged, while wholesale prices edged up in March relative to their level of a year earlier and posted the first increase on a twelve-month basis since July 2000.In the United States, the core consumer price index advanced at a faster rate in the first quarter than it had in the fourth quarter, reflecting the pass-through of higher energy prices and a leveling off of goods prices after sizable declines last year.  The higher goods price inflation owed, in part, to the recent run-up in the prices of non-oil imports, energy, and other commodities.  The price index for core personal consumption expenditures also rose at a faster rate in the first quarter than it had late last year.  Despite the rise in inflation this year, however, the cumulative increase in the overall consumer price index for the year ending in March was somewhat less than the advance for the twelve months ending in March 2003.  In the year ending in March, the increase in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures was similar to that of a year earlier.  Survey measures of near-term inflation expectations edged up somewhat in March and April, but measures of longer-term expectations decreased.  With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose notably less for the twelve months ending in March than they had in the year-earlier period.  The overall increase in the employment cost index for private industry for the twelve months ending in March was about the same as that for the twelve-month period ending a year earlier, as wages and salaries decelerated and benefits accelerated.At its meeting on March 16, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee  decided to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 percent.  In its announcement of this decision, the Committee indicated that the upside and downside risks to sustainable growth were roughly equal and that the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation had declined further so that it was almost equal to that of a rise.  The Committee also noted in March that although output had continued to expand at a solid pace, new hiring had lagged, and increases in core consumer prices were muted and expected to remain low.  As a result, the Committee determined that it could remain patient in removing its policy accommodation.The Committee\\'s decision at its March meeting to leave the intended level of the federal funds rate unchanged had been fully anticipated in financial markets.  However, market participants reportedly viewed the accompanying statement as suggesting that the Committee had a slightly weaker outlook for the economy than had been expected, and longer-dated futures rates and Treasury yields declined a few basis points after the announcement.  In response to the generally positive tone of economic data-especially the release of the much stronger-than-expected employment report for March-and congressional testimony by Chairman Greenspan, investors pushed market interest rates substantially higher over the intermeeting period.  By the time of the FOMC meeting in early May, quotes on federal funds futures contracts suggested that market participants expected policy tightening to begin sooner than previously anticipated and to proceed at a faster pace once it began.  The revision to policy expectations showed through to interest rates on nominal Treasury securities, which climbed significantly.  Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose almost as much, implying that inflation compensation only edged a little higher.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds rose a bit less than those on comparable-maturity Treasuries, but risk spreads on below-investment-grade bonds narrowed significantly as their yields increased by a more modest amount.  Major equity price indexes were about unchanged, as the downward pressure exerted by higher interest rates was offset by the effects of strong earnings reports, upward revisions to expected future earnings, and other positive economic news.In foreign exchange markets, the dollar appreciated against most major currencies over the intermeeting period, and it also gained against an index of the currencies of other major U.S. trading partners.  The dollar fell sharply against the yen early in the intermeeting period, but subsequently about reversed the decline.  Market participants attributed the dollar\\'s overall gains particularly to the stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data and the weaker-than-expected performance of the Canadian economy and economies in the euro area.M2 grew briskly during March and April as continued low opportunity costs and the temporary effects of mortgage refinancing boosted liquid deposits.  The strength was likely offset somewhat by the effects of individual non-withheld tax payments in April, which were lower than last year and therefore probably led to a smaller buildup in liquid deposits than incorporated in the seasonal adjustment factors.  Although currency growth continued to be held down in the first quarter by weak demand from abroad, it moved closer to its long-term trend in April.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue to expand briskly for the rest of 2004 before decelerating somewhat in 2005 as fiscal policy shifted to a slightly restrictive stance.  The considerable monetary and fiscal stimulus this year and still-strong advances in structural productivity were expected to cause businesses to shed still more of the caution they had been exhibiting in investing and hiring.  The labor market was projected to show steady improvement through the end of 2004, but the forecasted pace of hiring was expected to slow a little next year as economic growth moderated.  The staff anticipated that inventories would increase at a modest rate during the forecast horizon as businesses responded to continued strength in demand.  Business spending on equipment and software was expected to remain strong, with the expiration of the partial-expensing tax provision at the end of 2004 adding impetus this year.  The rise in mortgage rates was not likely to show through to demand for housing until the second half of 2004 and was expected to be partially offset in the longer term by rising employment and personal income.  The increases in employment and income were also projected to continue to boost consumer spending.  In light of recent increases in some price measures, the staff anticipated a transitory rise in the pace of core inflation in the near term.  However, it was expected that the remaining slack in resource utilization and strong productivity growth would keep core inflation at a low level over the forecast period.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective economic developments, a number of members noted that the outlook for production and employment had improved distinctly in the period since the March FOMC meeting.  Newly available data as well as commentary from business contacts almost uniformly suggested that the expansion had continued to broaden and had become more firmly established.  Statistical releases confirmed that consumer spending was rising at a brisk rate, housing activity remained at a high level, and business fixed investment was growing vigorously.  Significantly, the most recent data also provided evidence that the pace of hiring had begun to pick up, a development that was expected to provide further support to the expansion going forward.  Anecdotal information gathered from business contacts across the nation-particularly commentary suggesting rising orders, improving confidence, and a growing willingness to increase payrolls-tended to confirm the data that pointed to increasingly solid expansion.  Prospects for growth continued to be supported by fiscal policy, which was expected to remain stimulative through 2004, and by the effects of monetary policy accommodation.  Overall, Committee members were now more convinced that robust growth would be sustained, and most likely at a pace that would be adequate to make appreciable headway in narrowing margins of unutilized resources.  Regarding the outlook for inflation, members took particular note of recent data pointing to jumps in consumer and producer prices.  Many members indicated that the surprisingly large advances had substantially reduced the odds of further disinflation and also had increased their uncertainty about prospective price trends.  Still, most members saw low inflation as the most likely outcome.In their comments about key economic sectors, a number of members pointed to developments that were likely to support increased investment spending going forward.  Many business firms appeared to be experiencing a significant pickup in demand.  Anecdotal information suggested that some manufacturers had seen a notable rebound in orders, with several members citing, in particular, stronger demand for high-tech products as well as for machine tools, various types of heavy machinery, and aircraft.  Also, optimism regarding economic prospects among business executives seemed to be mounting, no doubt prompted in part by the increased demand they were experiencing and robust growth in profits.  Business contacts in several districts had indicated that, as a result of the improved outlook, they were taking steps to expand their capacity to produce, both by starting to augment work forces and by boosting fixed investment.  Committee members generally perceived overall business fixed investment as accelerating considerably, especially for equipment and software.  In contrast, investment in nonresidential structures remained sluggish, as vacancy rates in many markets were elevated and considerable excess capacity persisted in many production plants.  Drilling, however, was said to be strengthening in response to high oil and gas prices.While Committee members saw an overall brightening in the outlook for business fixed investment, a number of policymakers commented that some of the considerable caution that had earlier marked business attitudes apparently lingered.  The pace of hiring seemed to be picking up only gradually, fixed investment was still moderate in comparison with the strong cash flow being generated by robust profits, and anecdotal information indicated that firms in most industries were continuing to exercise tight control over inventories.  Indeed, several members remarked that the rate of inventory investment was surprisingly modest in the first quarter, although motor vehicle inventories were on the high side.  On the whole, the evidence of continued caution and disciplined spending in the business sector was seen as boding well for the durability of the expansion.Members viewed the household sector as continuing to play a key role in the expansion, with recent data as well as anecdotal information indicating that consumer spending was rising at a solid pace.  After dropping back in January, auto sales had accelerated over the remainder of the first quarter and appeared to be well maintained in April.  Expenditures for consumer services seemed to be expanding steadily.  Several members noted that tourism in their regions was picking up.  In addition, housing activity had stayed strong across the nation and was still climbing in some regions, with reports of growing backlogs in deliveries and substantial price increases in some markets.  The overall vigor in household spending was being supported by substantial gains in disposable income, partly reflecting tax cuts, generally sound balance sheets, accommodative financial conditions, and increases in consumer sentiment over the past year or so.  To date, the backup in fixed mortgage interest rates in recent months seemed to have had little adverse effect on homebuying, although it was noted that an appreciable further rise in longer-term market rates would represent a potential source of restraint on future household spending.Fiscal policy was viewed as likely to buoy the expansion of economic activity through 2004.  Real federal expenditures had jumped in the first quarter and were expected to rise further over the balance of the year.  Next year, fiscal impetus was likely to diminish, largely owing to the expiration of the tax provision permitting partial expensing of certain capital outlays.  Assessing the prospects for fiscal policy, however, was complicated by a lack of legislative progress to date in passing federal appropriations bills.  Regarding the longer-term federal budgetary outlook, an apparent breakdown in fiscal discipline was seen as an ongoing concern.  However, some progress was noted in reducing budgetary imbalances at the state and local levels.The external sector was expected to provide limited support for U.S. economic growth over the next two years.  Expansion of foreign economies was likely to fuel increases in U.S. exports, with strength expected particularly in computers and semiconductors.  Real imports, however, also appeared likely to continue rising strongly as domestic demand climbed further, leading to a widening of already substantial trade and current account deficits.  Some members saw a risk that growth in certain rapidly expanding regions abroad could slow, perhaps sharply, with potentially significant effects on the demand for U.S. exports as well as on global commodity prices.After a protracted period of meager gains in employment, conditions in the U.S. labor market evidently were improving in recent weeks.  In addition to noting the substantial jump in payrolls in March, several members relayed anecdotal information from business contacts around the nation that hiring was continuing to pick up and that firms were planning further increases in workforces.  Some temporary help firms reported rising demand, a possible precursor of a pickup in permanent hiring.  A number of members cited reports of difficulties in hiring within certain job families in which specialized skills were in short supply together with indications that wage increases in those occupations tended to be larger than average.  Even so, considerable slack seemed to remain in the labor market overall, and wage gains on the whole were moderate.Data on consumer and producer prices over the intermeeting period had generally come in on the high side of expectations, following considerable increases in commodity prices.  A significant number of Committee members reported information from their contacts that businesses were increasingly able to pass on cost increases to their customers and to boost prices more generally.  Some members cited instances in which earlier price discounts had been canceled and noted that surcharges for higher energy and steel prices were being added to base prices for certain goods.  Nonetheless, the extent to which these developments signaled an upturn in underlying inflation was unclear.  To some degree, the recent uptick in various price measures partly reflected factors, such as jumps in the prices of energy and non-oil imports, that were unlikely to be repeated.  Also, the recent evidence could be interpreted as indicating that the surprisingly sharp decline in measured inflation in 2003 exaggerated the drop in the underlying rate of inflation.  Indeed, some members saw underlying inflation as relatively stable and put low odds on the possibility that prices now were accelerating.  In their view, a range of factors was continuing to restrain inflation, including slack in resource utilization, strong productivity gains and corresponding downward pressures on unit labor costs, currently high price markups, and longer-term inflation expectations that apparently remained contained.  Others, however, were less confident about the degree of restraint on prices, noting that inflation predictions based on estimated output or employment gaps were subject to considerable error.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all of the members favored maintenance of the existing target of 1 percent for the federal funds rate.  It was recognized that the Committee would need to initiate a process of removing monetary policy accommodation at some point, and the recent experience suggested that the time at which policy firming appropriately would commence might be closer than previously had seemed most probable.  However, the appreciable rise in real long-term interest rates over the intermeeting period implied that financial market conditions had already tightened on balance.  Moreover, the evidence of a significant acceleration in hiring was still limited, and some members referred to the possibility that growth could falter, particularly if market yields were to rise sharply further.  With inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee saw a continuation of its existing policy stance as providing a degree of support to the economic expansion that was still appropriate.With regard to the Committee\\'s announcement to be released after the meeting, it was understood that the recent evidence that hiring had picked up, as well as the continued solid growth in output, would be highlighted.  Policymakers also concurred that, with the expansion apparently well established, the statement should again indicate that the upside and downside risks to sustainable growth for the next few quarters seemed to be roughly equal.  Members saw both downside and upside risks to prospects for inflation.  The probable persistence of slack in the economy for at least several more quarters, together with the likelihood that recent substantial gains in productivity would be extended, should continue to exert slight downward pressures on inflation.  At the same time, though, the recent stronger-than-expected increases in a number of price measures, anecdotal information suggesting a greater ability of businesses to implement and sustain price hikes, and multiplying signs of solid economic growth suggested that the upside risks to inflation had increased.  The members agreed that, all things considered, the risks to the goal of price stability had moved into balance in the period since the last meeting.The Committee also discussed at length the advantages and disadvantages of modifying or dropping its statement in the announcement following the March meeting that \"With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation.\"  All of the members agreed that, with policy tightening likely to begin sooner than previously expected, the reference to patience was no longer warranted.  The Committee focused instead on a formulation that would emphasize that policy tightening, once it began, probably could proceed at a pace that would be \"measured.\"  A number of policymakers were concerned that such an assertion could unduly constrain future adjustments to the stance of policy should the evidence emerging in coming months suggest that an appreciable firming would be appropriate.  Others, however, saw substantial benefits to inclusion of the proposed language.  These members noted that current economic circumstances made it likely that the process of returning policy to a more neutral setting would be more gradual, once under way, than in past episodes when inflation was well above levels consistent with price stability.  In addition, some policymakers observed that the timing and magnitude of future policy adjustments would ultimately be determined by the Committee\\'s interpretation of the incoming data on the economy and prices rather than by its current expectation of those developments.  On balance, all the members agreed that they could accept an indication in the statement that \". . . policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.\"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive.\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.\" The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal.  Similarly, the risks to the goal of price stability have moved into balance.  At this juncture, with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.\" Votes for this action:Messrs.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period May 4, 2004, through June 29, 2004.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.At this meeting, the Committee discussed staff papers and presentations on adjustment of the U.S. external accounts.  At more than $500 billion, the deficits in trade and current account balances are quite large in comparison with aggregate income.  Financing of the deficits had recently included both large foreign private purchases of U.S. securities and increased foreign official inflows.  The sizable current account deficit could be viewed as reflecting very low levels of national saving, in both its government and private components, in relation to investment opportunities in the United States that were very attractive.  The staff noted that outsized external deficits could not be sustained indefinitely.  However, the historical evidence indicated that such deficits could be quite persistent, and the adjustment of imbalances was not necessarily imminent.  The adjustment, once under way, might well proceed in a relatively benign fashion, particularly if fiscal, monetary, and trade policies were appropriate, but the possibility that the adjustment could involve more wrenching changes could not be ruled out.  In any case, a movement toward balance in the trade and current accounts would likely have effects that differ appreciably across sectors of the U.S. economy.  Members of the Committee noted that monetary policy was not well equipped to promote the adjustment of external imbalances but could best contribute by maintaining an environment of price stability that would foster maximum sustainable economic growth.  Fiscal policy had a potentially larger role to play by promoting an increase in national saving, but the adjustment would involve shifts in demand and output both domestically and abroad, and changes to U.S. fiscal policy alone probably would not be sufficient to foster the adjustment.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy continued to expand at a solid pace during the second quarter.  Although growth in consumer spending appeared to have slowed somewhat, the demand for housing increased from its robust first-quarter pace.  Business fixed investment, boosted by surging outlays on equipment and software, also grew rapidly.  The labor market improved further during the quarter, with large gains in employment registered in April and May.  Core consumer price inflation picked up, reflecting in part the pass-through of substantial advances in energy prices and non-energy import prices.The labor market rebounded strongly in recent months.  Private nonfarm payrolls grew rapidly in April and May, with hiring widespread across industries.  The manufacturing sector appeared to be on a more solid footing, as manufacturers added jobs in each of the past four months after more than three years of declines.  Aggregate hours moved up in both April and May, bringing the level of hours substantially above its trough of last summer.  Despite the recent strength in hiring, the unemployment rate changed little in recent months, and the labor force participation rate remained low.Industrial production accelerated in April and May after a sizable advance in the first quarter.  Output at utilities surged in the latter month, reflecting weather-related factors, and factory output excluding motor vehicles, buoyed by strong gains in both high-tech manufacturing industries and in most non-high-tech industries, expanded sharply in both months.  In contrast, the production of motor vehicles declined as automakers trimmed outsized inventory positions.  Capacity utilization moved higher but stayed below its long-run average.Growth in real consumer spending appeared to have slowed somewhat in recent months from its first-quarter pace.  Although outlays for motor vehicles in May more than retraced their April decline and purchases of services advanced at an appreciable rate, spending on nondurable goods remained sluggish.  Despite higher energy prices, real disposable personal income continued its uptrend in recent months, benefiting from an improved labor market and last year\\'s tax cut.  Home prices also continued to rise at a rapid pace, contributing importantly to increases in household wealth.  Survey measures of consumer confidence moved up in June from already favorable levels.Activity in the housing market increased in April and May despite a considerable rise in mortgage interest rates.  Single-family housing starts edged above their rapid first-quarter pace, and sales of both new and existing homes reached record levels in May.  In the volatile multifamily sector, housing starts fell somewhat in May, but, more generally, construction activity in this sector had been surprisingly resilient in light of the high vacancy rate for such units.Business investment spending appeared to have advanced at a brisk pace in the second quarter, as rising output, low user cost of capital, and increased corporate cash flow continued to foster a favorable environment for capital spending.  Although new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft dipped in May, both series remained on a solid uptrend, and, with orders exceeding shipments, backlogs continued to grow.  Spending on transportation equipment, which dropped in the first quarter, appeared to rebound in recent months, while outside the transportation and high-tech sectors, increases in spending moderated from their rapid first-quarter pace.  After declining in the first quarter, overall investment in nonresidential structures appeared to pick up a little in the second quarter, though the performance of the major types of construction remained mixed.  Spending on office buildings and manufacturing structures continued to be depressed by high vacancy rates, while outlays for commercial buildings moved up in conjunction with declines in vacancy rates for such structures.  In addition, judging by the number of natural gas drilling rigs in operation, spending on drilling and mining structures rose in recent months.The pace of inventory accumulation remained subdued.  Although the book value of manufacturing and trade inventories increased appreciably in the first quarter and continued to rise at about the same pace in April, the recent large increases in the book-value data were due importantly to a jump in the price of oil and a run-up in the prices of intermediate materials.  Inventory-sales ratios in manufacturing and retail trade edged higher in April but remained near their historical lows; meanwhile, inventory-sales ratios in the wholesale trade sector trended lower.The U.S. international trade deficit reached a new record in April, reflecting in large part a sharp decline in exports of goods.  The fall in goods exports was widespread, with notable decreases in capital goods, industrial supplies, and agricultural products.  Exports of services, in contrast, increased in April.  Imports of goods edged higher, as a large decline in the value of imported oil was offset by an increase in imports of non-oil products, and imports of services increased.  Real GDP in the major foreign industrial countries expanded at a healthy pace in the first quarter.  Indicators of economic activity in the second quarter for Canada and the United Kingdom were also favorable, whereas those for the euro area were somewhat mixed.  Japan\\'s economy, supported by robust private domestic demand and rising consumer confidence, evidently continued to expand strongly in the second quarter.  Mainly as a result of higher energy prices, consumer price inflation moved up a bit in the second quarter in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the euro area, while slight deflation persisted in Japan.Consumer price inflation turned up this year from the very low rates registered in 2003, both for overall measures and for those that exclude food and energy.  Overall consumer prices rose more quickly than core prices, reflecting the direct contributions of substantial increases in prices of food and energy.  But the step-up in core inflation was also due in part to the pass-through of higher energy and import costs into core consumer prices.  Some survey measures of short-term inflation expectations moved higher in recent months, but longer-term expectations remained reasonably well contained.  Commodity prices escalated sharply during the early months of 2004, but indexes of spot prices for industrial materials and for wholesale gasoline retreated appreciably in recent weeks.  Meanwhile, labor costs appeared to have turned up in the first half of the year.  Hourly compensation in private industry rose in the first quarter at the same rate as in 2003, but with the pace of productivity advance moderating, unit labor costs moved higher.  In April and May, increases in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls exceeded the monthly gains registered in the first quarter and were well above the increases in the fourth quarter of 2003.At its meeting on May 4, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 percent.  The Committee retained its assessment that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth were roughly equal, but it announced that the risks to the goal of price stability had moved into balance.  The Committee also noted that output had continued to expand at a solid pace, new hiring had appeared to pick up, and although incoming data on inflation showed that it had moved somewhat higher, longer-term inflation expectations had remained well contained.  Reflecting these developments, the Committee concluded that it could remove policy accommodation at a pace that was likely to be measured.The Committee\\'s decision at its May meeting to leave the intended level of the federal funds rate unchanged had been fully anticipated by market participants.  Likewise, the replacement of the sentence in the announcement reporting that the Committee could be patient in removing policy accommodation with one indicating that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured had little net effect on money market futures rates on the day of the announcement.  Over the balance of the intermeeting period, however, market participants marked up significantly the extent of expected policy tightening in response to data that indicated robust gains in employment and spending and somewhat elevated inflation, as well as to comments by Committee members providing reassurance that policy would be tightened as necessary to contain any incipient inflationary pressures.  Revisions to policy expectations showed through to interest rates on nominal Treasury securities, which increased commensurately.  Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose almost as much as those on their nominal counterparts, leaving inflation compensation only slightly higher, on net, by the end of the intermeeting period. Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate securities rose about the same amount as those on comparable Treasuries, leaving risk spreads about unchanged.  Generally positive economic news and further improvements in the outlook for corporate earnings evidently offset the influence of higher interest rates, and major equity indexes edged higher over the intermeeting period.  In foreign exchange markets, the dollar depreciated somewhat against major currencies, and it rose a bit against an index of currencies of other major U.S. trading partners.M2 continued to expand rapidly in May.  The upswing in M2 growth since late winter stemmed in part from the temporary effects of mortgage refinancing, which boosted liquid deposits over this period, though M2 was also buoyed by strong gains in nominal income.  In recent months, a rebound in currency growth and reduced portfolio shifts by households from monetary assets to equities and bonds also supported the expansion of M2.  The growth of M2 slowed appreciably during the first half of June.  Commercial bank credit decelerated in May, reflecting a contraction in bank holdings of securities and a slowdown in the growth of loans.  The slowing in loan growth was concentrated mainly in real estate credits and was due partly to heavy securitizations.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue to expand at a solid pace through 2005.  Monetary policy was expected to support economic activity over the projection period, and fiscal policy was anticipated to remain accommodative through 2004.  Moreover, persisting strong gains in structural productivity would likely continue to provide significant impetus to spending.  With firms shedding their unusual caution of the past few years, further large additions to payrolls over the next several quarters were anticipated, followed by a gradual moderation in the rate of increase in employment.  Strong profits, sustained increases in aggregate demand, and a favorable financing environment were expected to keep business spending on equipment and software on a healthy upward trajectory over the forecast period.  The impending expiration of the partial-expensing tax provision was likely to provide an additional boost to capital spending later this year, although the shifting forward of some investment was expected to dampen capital spending in early 2005.  In addition, inventory investment was forecast to increase gradually in order to bring changes in stocks closer in line with rising sales.  Robust employment growth and the cumulative productivity gains of recent years were expected to contribute to strong advances in real disposable income, sustaining the expansion of consumption spending over the forecast period.  Core inflation was projected to fall back later this year from its pace in the first five months and to remain low in 2005, as the transitory effects of higher energy and non-oil import prices waned.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period continued to portray an economy that was expanding briskly and was likely to continue to do so for some time. Business and consumer expenditures were on a strong uptrend, and related growth in output was associated with notable improvement in labor market conditions and in manufacturing activity. Members saw the persistence of a relatively vigorous expansion in overall economic activity as a likely prospect in the context of continuing stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies, accommodative financial conditions, growing business optimism, favorable consumer sentiment, and robust increases in productivity. Solid increases in economic activity and employment should in turn provide ongoing support to business and consumer spending. Members acknowledged that their favorable outlook for economic activity was based on the assumption that major terrorist disruptions would be averted.In light of the strength of economic activity and recent indications of somewhat increased price pressures, the members focused particular attention on the outlook for inflation.  They referred to statistical and anecdotal evidence that on the whole pointed to some recent acceleration of consumer prices and to some increase in near-term inflation expectations. Factors cited in this regard included large increases in prices of energy and intermediate materials, both of which appeared to be passing through at least in part to core consumer prices. Members referred to some limited inflationary impetus as well from the depreciation of the dollar and larger increases in labor compensation. Considerable uncertainty still surrounded the overall extent to which competitive pressures would allow producers to pass through rising costs to prices of finished goods; anecdotal reports suggested that the ability of many producers to do so was increasing but was far from universal at this point. With regard to the prospective course of inflation, members suggested that some of the rise in core inflation in recent months appeared to have resulted from what might well prove to be transitory factors, notably including increases in energy and other import prices, which were not seen as likely to persist and indeed might be partially reversed. Just how much slowing of price increases was likely after some relatively elevated readings was difficult to forecast. Those who anticipated a noticeable deceleration emphasized the contribution of the one-time price increases that had boosted inflation recently, persisting, albeit diminishing, margins of unemployed labor and other productive resources, the anticipation of strong further gains in productivity and declines in markups of goods prices over costs, and steady long-term inflation expectations. Others tended to emphasize the changes in business attitudes and expectations, the strength in labor compensation, and the tendency for underlying inflation trends to be subject to considerable momentum that was unlikely to be reversed quickly. Whatever their inflation forecasts, several noted that they now had less confidence in those forecasts than earlier. A number of members qualified their inflation outlook by noting that its realization likely would require an adjustment to monetary policy over time that brought the latter to a neutral stance as the economy continued to move toward full utilization of its resources.In preparation for the midyear monetary policy report to Congress, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 2004 and 2005. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP were concentrated in the upper part of a 4 to 4-3/4 percent range for 2004, implying expectations by most members of a pickup over the second half of the year; for 2005 the forecasts were in a reduced range of 3-1/2 to 4 percent. These rates of growth were associated with ranges for the civilian rate of unemployment of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 and 5 to 5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.  Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE price index, pointed to marginally higher rates of inflation encompassed by ranges of 1-1/2 to 2 percent for this year and 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percent for 2005.In their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy, many of the members emphasized the strength in business capital spending. Explanatory factors included the sustained demand for business output, strong profit margins and cash flow, low capital costs, and the partial-expensing tax provision. Weakness persisted, however, in the nonresidential construction sector, though signs of improvement were emerging in some areas. Many business contacts were expressing a marked degree of optimism about the outlook for business activity in the second half of the year. Currently low inventory-to-sales ratios, indeed reports of emerging bottlenecks in some markets, were expected to foster efforts to rebuild inventories and thus add support to the expansion going forward.Consumer outlays were rising more moderately in the second quarter and somewhat below expectations. The slowing was not universal, however. Some members reported a continuation of robust consumer expenditures in various parts of the country. Looking ahead, members, in part echoing the sentiment of contacts among retailers, anticipated renewed strength in consumer spending in the context of sizable further growth in employment and disposable incomes and a generally high level of consumer confidence. In housing markets, activity had remained at generally high levels, with only a few signs that rising mortgage rates were beginning to hold down sales and construction. There was evidence in some areas that inventories of unsold homes had risen. Members noted that persisting overall strength in housing might to some extent be a response to expectations of further increases in mortgage rates, implying that a slowdown might be likely later in the year.Members commented that fiscal policy was continuing to provide appreciable impetus to the economy, in part because of the incentives for business investment associated with the partial-expensing tax legislation. Following the scheduled expiration of that legislation at the end of this year and with more moderate gains in federal spending forecast in the absence of new legislation, the federal budget was expected to become mildly contractionary in 2005, although a marked degree of uncertainty surrounded this outlook. Many state and local governments were increasing their spending more rapidly in response to brightening budget situations.Expanding foreign economies and the depreciation of the dollar were expected to foster appreciable growth in U.S. exports, but with imports still considerably larger than exports, the external sector was likely to make a measurable negative contribution to U.S. GDP growth this year and next.  On the inflation side, higher import prices and, importantly, the rise in domestic and imported oil prices were adding to domestic inflationary pressures, although improving oil supplies had recently contributed to somewhat lower domestic gasoline prices.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all of the members indicated that they could support an upward adjustment in the target for the federal funds rate from a level of 1 percent to 1-1/4 percent. Recent developments, notably the persistence of solid gains in output and employment along with indications of some increase in inflation, were seen as warranting a first step in the process of removing policy accommodation. The timing and pace of further policy moves would depend, of course, on the members\\' reading of the incoming economic information and their interpretation of its implications for economic activity and inflation. In this regard, members commented that they could envision a series of gradual or \"measured\" policy moves as likely to be consistent with the attainment of the Committee\\'s objectives for sustaining progress toward higher levels of resource utilization and maintaining price stability. A few indicated, however, that their preference would be to remove any characterization of possible future policy actions from the Committee\\'s statements. Partly reflecting anticipated monetary policy actions, financial market conditions had tightened in recent months, but short-term interest rates were quite low, especially when judged against the recent level of inflation.  Depending on the rate at which resource utilization increased and the level and trend of inflation, a more aggressive pace toward reaching a neutral policy stance might be called for so as to provide assurance of containing emerging inflationary pressures and averting the potential need for greater overall tightening over time.In the Committee\\'s review of the announcement to be released shortly after this meeting, members agreed that an updating of the reasons for its policy decision was desirable, specifically by adding a reference to the possibility that some of the recent acceleration in inflation might reflect transitory factors. The members also decided to modify the reference to labor market conditions by referring in general terms to improved conditions rather than more narrowly to a pickup in hiring to acknowledge the broad range of labor market indicators considered by the Committee. They agreed to retain the assessments adopted at the May meeting indicating that they viewed the upside and downside risks to both the attainment of sustainable economic growth and to the goal of price stability as roughly in balance for the next few quarters. However, with regard to the outlook for inflation, a number of members emphasized that they would view the risks as tilted to the upside in the absence of further policy tightening actions that would bring the stance of policy to a more neutral setting. Many members also underscored their view that the statement should make clear that the Committee would be prepared to respond to significant changes in economic prospects and take actions that were deemed necessary to meet the Committee\\'s commitment to maintain price stability.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive.\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 1-1/4 percent.\" The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters areroughly equal.  With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, theCommittee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that islikely to be measured.

Alvarez as General Counsel of the Committee to serve until the election of a successor at the first regularly scheduled meeting after December 31, 2004.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.The Manager also reported on recent developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period June 29, 2004, through August 9, 2004.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth softened somewhat in recent months.  While strength in the housing market persisted and business outlays remained healthy, growth in consumer spending fell off significantly.  Additionally, gains in employment, which were robust in earlier months, slowed sharply in June and July.  Industrial production also decelerated modestly in June, but available indicators suggested a bounceback in July.  Core consumer price inflation moderated in May and June, despite further increases in energy prices.Growth in employment slowed in June and July after displaying significant improvement in preceding months.  The weakness was reported to be widespread, with the retail trade, information, financial activities, and government sectors registering declines on average over the two months.  The construction and services sectors posted gains, but at a pace well below those of previous months.  In contrast, after little change in June, payrolls in manufacturing rose appreciably in July.  The average workweek declined in June but edged up in July, and aggregate hours of private production workers showed a similar pattern.  Labor force participation moved up slightly in recent months, and the unemployment rate, which was unchanged in June, edged down to 5-1/2 percent in July.After rising rapidly in April and May, industrial production declined modestly in June, although manufacturing output, excluding motor vehicles and parts, increased a bit.  Production of motor vehicles and parts declined noticeably, as automakers scaled back assemblies in response to elevated inventories.  Output at utilities also fell in June as temperatures returned to more normal levels after an unseasonably warm May.  Activity in the mining sector changed little.  Overall capacity utilization was off slightly in June, but utilization on average over the quarter was above that of the first quarter.  However, data on the growth in production-worker hours and other indicators of production suggested that manufacturing output bounced back in July.  Growth in consumer spending slowed sharply in the second quarter, posting only a small increase after a robust expansion in the first quarter.  Although gains in outlays for services continued at a solid rate in the second quarter, expenditures for goods declined markedly.  Data on consumer expenditures showed particular weakness in June, with either declines or no growth in purchases across most categories of goods and services.  Purchases of cars and trucks contracted in that month but rebounded in July.  Real disposable income was unchanged in June, held back by increases in prices of food and, especially, energy.Activity in the housing market remained strong in June despite some variation across segments.  Single-family housing starts fell back from very high levels in April and May.  Multifamily housing starts also declined in June, though only a bit.  Sales of existing homes jumped again in June to set a new record, and sales of new homes came in just below the record pace posted in May.Business investment spending on equipment and software was solid in the second quarter, posting growth a little above the pace of the first quarter.  Performance across categories, however, was uneven.  Spending in the transportation equipment sector bounced back from a first-quarter decline, and outlays in the high-tech sector grew twice as fast as overall equipment and software spending in the quarter.  Excluding transportation and high-tech equipment, however, gains were minimal.  Real business investment in nonresidential structures turned up in the second quarter, albeit to a still-depressed level.  Increased spending on office buildings, commercial structures, and various other types of buildings more than offset a sizable decline in the power generation component.  Real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles picked up in the second quarter as the manufacturing, merchant wholesalers, and retail trade segments all boosted stocks.  Book-value inventory-sales ratios edged up, but remained at fairly low levels.The U.S. international trade deficit declined somewhat in May after reaching a record high in April.  The value of exports of goods and services climbed substantially, with exports of goods more than accounting for the entire rise, as exports of services edged down.  The value of imports of goods and services also increased in the month, but by less than exports.  Available data indicated that major foreign industrial economies continued to expand at a solid pace in recent months.  In Japan, gains in exports and household expenditures fueled the advance in output, and surveys of business and consumer confidence were also favorable.  Real GDP accelerated in the United Kingdom, and economic activity grew at a solid pace in Canada, led by a surge in investment.  Indicators for the euro area suggested that activity decelerated a bit in the second quarter. Growth of real GDP in China slowed significantly in the spring.Core consumer price inflation moderated substantially in May and June, though sizable increases in food and energy prices continued to push up overall consumer price inflation.  Increases in the food and energy components of the CPI were smaller in June than in May, and further deceleration was expected as gasoline and natural gas prices eased in July and supply conditions in a number of agricultural segments improved.  In July, households\\' expectations for consumer inflation in the year ahead fell somewhat.  Overall producer prices for finished goods were down in June, as declines in prices for food and energy were only partially offset by modest growth in the core components of the index.  With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index for hourly compensation of private workers for the three months ending in June advanced at about the same rate as it had over the previous year-and-a-half.  Unit labor costs, however, increased faster in the second quarter than in the first.At its meeting on June 29-30, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee adopted a directive that called for conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 1-1/4 percent.  The Committee continued to perceive that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters were roughly equal.  In its public statement, the Committee noted that, with underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, it believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured, but that, nonetheless, it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.This decision to raise the intended level of the federal funds rate by 25 basis points was anticipated in the financial markets, yet investors revised down their expectations for the path of policy upon the release of the accompanying statement.  In particular, investors noted that the Committee attributed some of the recent increase in inflation to transitory factors, retained its earlier balance of risks assessment, and reiterated its belief that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured.  Subsequently, the Chairman\\'s Congressional testimony on monetary policy, which suggested that recent softness in consumer spending should prove short-lived and emphasized the FOMC\\'s commitment to price stability, spurred an upward tilt in the market\\'s expected path of monetary policy.  Over the remainder of the intermeeting period, though, expectations of policy tightening were revised down somewhat, on balance, as incoming data pointed to weaker-than-anticipated spending and employment and more subdued core inflation.  Yields on intermediate- and long-term nominal Treasury securities dropped significantly over the intermeeting period.  Available data suggested that corporate credit quality remained strong, and yields on investment-grade bonds moved roughly in line with those on Treasury securities.  Speculative-grade yields, however, fell by less.  In equity markets, broad indexes declined appreciably, reflecting the soft economic data, concerns about energy prices, and guidance from corporations pointing to a less-optimistic trajectory for earnings than investors apparently had been expecting.  In foreign exchange markets, the dollar\\'s trade-weighted value against other major currencies ended the period little changed, on net.  Following several months of robust expansion, M2 grew at a slower pace in June and available data implied a slight contraction in July.  Most of the weakness owed to a slowdown in liquid deposit growth that was related in part to the decline in mortgage refinancing activity.  In addition, retail money market funds resumed their earlier decline.  Currency growth, however, strengthened over the two months, partly as a result of a pickup in foreign demand.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue to expand at a solid pace through 2005, supported by a relatively accommodative monetary policy over the projection period and by stimulative fiscal policy through 2004.  Consumer spending was expected to strengthen in the near term, boosted by strong consumer confidence and rising disposable income, which would likely continue to be propelled by robust growth in structural productivity.  Favorable financial conditions, higher profits, and the partial-expensing tax incentives over the remainder of this year were projected to lead to a near-term acceleration in business fixed investment.  Subsequently, growth in capital spending was expected to moderate somewhat but still to remain on a healthy upward trajectory.  Despite recent weakness in employment growth, the waning of firms\\' unusual caution of recent years was expected to foster a pickup in hiring over the next several quarters.  Consumer price inflation was projected to remain low over the forecast period as the sharp increases in energy and import prices experienced earlier in the year partially unwound.  Slack resource utilization through 2005 was also expected to help hold down inflation.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members noted that the pace of the expansion had moderated.  In particular, consumer spending, which had previously provided considerable support to aggregate demand, had slowed sharply in the second quarter.  At the same time, growth in payrolls had fallen back in June and July after posting significant gains in the spring.  While the recent moderation in growth might portend a substantially slower expansion going forward than had previously been expected, the Committee did not see such a sizable shortfall as the most likely outcome.  Activity in the housing sector remained strong, and investment outlays continued to advance at a good pace.  With economic growth buoyed by accommodative monetary policy and supportive credit conditions more generally as well as by robust underlying growth in productivity, the Committee believed that conditions were in place for the pace of expansion to strengthen enough to continue to trim margins of slack in resource utilization.  Indeed, the limited available evidence pointed to a rebound in household spending, especially on motor vehicles, in July and early August, and some indicators suggested continued improvement in labor market conditions.  Regarding the outlook for inflation, the most recent data were seen as consistent with an assessment that a portion of the higher rates of price increases recorded earlier in the year had reflected transitory factors. Committee members generally agreed that higher energy prices had played an important role in the recent moderation of economic growth.  While the direct effect of higher energy prices on real disposable income could account for only a relatively small part of the reduction in the growth of consumer spending, some members suggested that those effects may have been exacerbated by substantial increases in expected future energy costs as well as greater uncertainty about those costs.  Moreover, the economy seemed to have responded in some past episodes to sharp increases in energy costs by much more than could be explained by most models.  Still, some Committee members doubted that higher energy prices were sufficient to explain all of the recent slowdown in spending.  Effects of increased energy prices on consumer and business confidence, which might have led to a larger spending response, had not been evident, and the consequences for growth in other industrialized countries dependent on imported oil appeared to have been fairly modest thus far.  Informed in part by prices in futures markets, Committee members anticipated that energy costs would level out and perhaps fall back from their recent highs, but they noted that there was considerable uncertainty about that outlook.Policymakers focused their comments about key sectors of the economy on the slowdown in consumer spending toward the end of the second quarter.  Business contacts in some parts of the country suggested that, in addition to higher energy prices, unseasonable weather may have limited spending for a time.  The Committee discussed a number of other factors that may have contributed to the slowdown, including a waning of the stimulus from last year\\'s tax cuts, which had previously provided considerable impetus to spending, and the possibility that, with stock prices down, saving rates near historic lows, and the outlook more uncertain, households may have felt the need to boost saving.  Although a complete accounting for the moderation in growth was not possible, the Committee agreed that a resumption of faster growth in consumer spending was very likely.  Continued strength in home construction did not suggest that households were in the process of retrenching, and gains in income, low interest rates, and robust consumer confidence were seen as undergirding further gains in household spending going forward.  Members noted that reports of rising motor vehicle sales in July and early August and a firming of chain store sales in recent weeks provided some limited evidence that consumption spending was picking up.  Investment spending had continued to advance, though perhaps at a somewhat slower pace than some members had anticipated.  Several policymakers noted that businesses remained cautious about capital spending and hiring and were attempting to boost production as much as possible with existing capacity and payrolls.  Indeed, some members suggested that heightened uncertainty, reflecting the effects of higher energy prices and increased concerns about geopolitical risks, might have contributed to greater business caution of late.  Nonetheless, business confidence generally remained high, and the fundamentals for investment--including solid growth in productivity, robust profits and cash flow, and accommodative financial markets--pointed to continued healthy gains in business outlays.  A few members also noted that the commercial real estate sector, which had been weak for some time, was showing signs of improvement.    In their remarks regarding the external sector of the economy, members noted that on average growth abroad had remained reasonably robust, which should support U.S. exports.  However, the U.S. trade deficit was expected to remain large as imports increased in response to solid growth in the United States.  In their discussion of recent labor market trends, Committee members noted the slowing of job growth reported in June and July.  Committee members pointed to several factors that that might have contributed to the recent weakness.  Firms\\' focus on controlling costs and implementing further productivity improvements were doubtless continuing to play a role.  Higher labor costs, particularly those related to health benefits, were also reportedly weighing on some firms\\' hiring decisions.  However, policymakers noted that the monthly payrolls data might be providing an incomplete picture of expansion in economic activity because of near-term variation in the rate of growth of productivity.  In addition, many members pointed to data from the survey of households, which showed both a rise in labor force participation and a decline in the unemployment rate in July, as well as to initial claims for unemployment compensation, which remained near recent lows.  Moreover, survey data on labor market attitudes of both consumers and businesses had not signaled a significant deterioration in employment prospects.  All things considered, the Committee expected the pace of employment gains to improve in coming months.  In their review of the outlook for prices, members noted that incoming data over the intermeeting period had shown a slowing in core inflation from the high levels posted earlier in the year, consistent with the Committee\\'s view that a portion of the earlier increase had reflected transitory factors.  Information from business contacts suggested that a number of firms had been able to pass on at least some of their higher energy and other costs to customers, but few signs of more widespread price increases were apparent.  Some members expressed concern about developments in the transportation sector, where trucking costs were reportedly on the rise and bottlenecks in the railroad industry were triggering delivery delays.  Looking forward, however, most members thought that rapid productivity growth and flat or declining energy prices would limit increases in the overall unit costs of businesses.  Despite the higher rates of headline inflation earlier in the year, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained and slack in resource markets was seen as persisting, leading the Committee to expect underlying inflation to be relatively low.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all the members favored an increase in the target for the federal funds rate from 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent.  Although the pace of economic growth had moderated in the second quarter, the Committee believed that the softness would prove short-lived and that the economy was poised to resume a stronger rate of expansion going forward.  Given the current quite low level of short-term rates, especially when judged against the recent level of inflation, members noted that significant cumulative policy tightening likely would be needed to foster conditions consistent with the Committee\\'s objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth.  In this context, a relatively small tightening move at this meeting would help to limit the risk of a rise in inflation expectations and reduce the likelihood that policy might need to be adjusted more sharply in the future, thereby lowering the attendant risks to financial markets and the economy.  The members thought that policy accommodation probably could be removed gradually--a view that had been reinforced by the slower pace of growth and more moderate rates of price increase that had become evident over the intermeeting period.  However, members also recognized that the timing and pace of additional policy tightening would depend importantly on incoming economic data and the Committee\\'s assessment of their implications for economic activity and inflation.  With regard to the Committee\\'s announcement to be released after the meeting, members agreed that the description of recent economic circumstances should acknowledge the slowing in output and employment growth, as well as highlight the role of higher energy prices in those developments.  They also agreed to retain the assessments adopted at the June meeting that the risks to the Committee\\'s goals of sustainable economic growth and price stability were balanced over the next few quarters.  While a more persistent slowing of household spending was possible, and more subdued inflation readings over the intermeeting period had eased concerns about a potential increase in underlying inflation, policymakers continued to judge the risks to sustainable growth and the inflation outlook as roughly balanced.  The Committee chose to reiterate its belief that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured as well as its intention to respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to achieve its goal of price stability.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive.\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 1-1/2 percent.\" The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal.

Bryan and Gavin, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and St. Louis respectively By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on August 10, 2004, were approved.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.The Manager also reported on recent developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period August 10, 2004, through September 20, 2004.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth regained some vigor in recent months after having slowed in late spring.  The August labor market report showed a moderate gain in payrolls.  After contracting in June, industrial production strengthened modestly on average in July and August, and the increases were widespread across sectors.  Consumer spending rose sharply in July, housing activity increased further in August, and business outlays picked up last month.  Core consumer price inflation moderated in June and July, and a decline in energy prices further damped overall inflation in July.The labor market improved in August, and the unemployment rate edged down to5.4 percent.  Private nonfarm payrolls grew moderately, with gains registered in the manufacturing, construction, financial activities, and nonbusiness services categories.  In addition, the figures for June and July were revised upward and suggested that the deceleration in hiring over that period was not as abrupt as had been previously thought.  The average workweek was unchanged in August from the upward-revised July level and was a bit higher than its second-quarter average.  The labor force participation rate edged down in August.Total industrial production advanced modestly on average in July and August, down slightly from its second-quarter pace.  The increases in manufacturing production since the end of the second quarter were widespread.  Output of motor vehicles and parts jumped in August.  Excluding motor vehicles and parts, the expansion in manufacturing output was brisk in July but more subdued in August.  In the high-tech sector, computer production continued to rise in August, and the output of communications equipment posted its fourth consecutive monthly increase.  In contrast, output at utilities declined further in July and August, while mining-related production was about flat on average over those same months.  The rate of capacity utilization ticked up in July from its average over the first half of the year and remained steady in August.Real consumer spending grew sharply in July after having slowed in the second quarter, and the available indicators suggest that spending held fairly steady in August.  Expenditures on goods jumped in July and moderated in August, while spending on services moved up somewhat in July.  Purchases of motor vehicles surged in July and fell back in August.  For the two months together, the average pace of these outlays exceeded that seen in the first half of the year, reflecting in part a further sweetening of incentives.  Real disposable income was up slightly in July, as increases in compensation were largely offset by declines in other income categories.  The latest readings on consumer confidence showed a drop in August amid labor market slack and near-record gasoline prices, and a further slight decline in September, but the readings for the third quarter averaged above those for the second quarter.Housing activity increased further in August. Housing starts for new single-family homes bounced up in July and remained about unchanged in August, and starts of multi-family homes rose somewhat each month.  Taken together, total housing starts in August reached the highest level in five months.  Home sales remained robust in July for both existing and new homes, although sales were below the monthly peaks recorded earlier in the year.  Interest rates on thirty-year conventional mortgages receded over the past couple of months, retracing much of the runup in rates that occurred earlier in the year.  Weekly data on mortgage applications to purchase homes continued to move up, on average, through mid-September.Business outlays for equipment and software increased at a significant pace in the second quarter, and the available data pointed to a similar advance more recently.  Spending was being  supported by the continued gains in business output, low financing costs, ongoing price declines for high-tech capital, and the corporate sector\\'s large cushion of liquid assets.  Spending on transportation equipment and other capital goods was brisk in the second quarter, although expenditures in the high-tech sector decelerated.  In July, shipments of capital goods excluding aircraft fell substantially from the rate seen in the first half of the year, but orders were relatively strong.  Real business investment in nonresidential structures remained depressed, but the most recent data provided a sign of some improvement.  In the office sector, the vacancy rate came in only a little below its recent peak, although property values had inched up, and the vacancy rate for industrial space also remained near its high.  The retail sector, in contrast, continued to fare better.Excluding motor vehicles, the pace of inventory accumulation in July continued at its second-quarter rate.  A decline in stocks in the retail trade segment was more than offset by stockbuilding in the manufacturing and wholesale trade segments.  Although the book value of manufacturing and trade inventories rose appreciably in July, these gains were again inflated by price increases in the petroleum sector.  Inventory-sales ratios in the manufacturing sector, as in the retail and wholesale trade sectors (excluding motor vehicles and parts), remained about flat in July.The U.S. international trade deficit reached a record high in June, bringing it to a new high in the second quarter as a percentage of nominal GDP.  While the deficit fell back in July, it remained much above May\\'s reading.  In June, exports fell sharply, with declines widespread, while imports rose, owing in part to a surge in petroleum imports.  In July, exports registered a modest recovery, driven by capital goods, industrial supplies, and automotive products, while the value of imports fell with the sharp decline in oil imports.  Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand in the second quarter, although growth slowed in Japan and in the euro area.  Indicators to date for the third quarter were mixed.Core consumer prices edged up slightly over the months of June and July, as inflation in both goods and services moderated.  The core PCE price index was flat in July but, like the core CPI, was up a bit on balance over June and July.  The twelve-month change in core consumer prices based on either measure was somewhat higher this July than for the same period last year.  Retail energy prices fell in July, led by a drop in gasoline prices after large gains in a number of earlier months.  During the summer, gasoline inventories climbed above seasonal norms because of lower demand and increased imports, and the resulting downward pressure on margins led gasoline prices to fall even as crude oil prices moved higher.  Owing to the decline in energy prices in July, inflation in overall consumer prices slowed that month.  In August, households\\' expectations for consumer inflation in the year ahead edged lower for the second consecutive month.  Meanwhile, after a small rise in July, the prices of finished goods faced by producers moved down a bit in August.  Turning to labor costs, hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector rose at a faster pace in the second quarter than it did in the first, but the advance was in line with the average rate of increase over the preceding four quarters.  Unit labor costs measured at nonfinancial corporations also registered an increase in the second quarter.At its meeting on August 10, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 1½ percent, and to retain its assessment of balanced risks with respect to sustainable economic growth and price stability.  In its announcement, the Committee noted that output growth had moderated in recent months and that the pace of improvement in labor market conditions had slowed, but that the softness likely owed importantly to the substantial rise in energy prices.  It also noted that while inflation was somewhat elevated this year, a portion of the pickup seemed to reflect transitory factors.  The Committee went on to comment that the economy appeared poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion going forward, that it continued to believe that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured, and that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.Although the Committee\\'s decision to raise the intended level of the federal funds rate by 25 basis points was widely anticipated in financial markets, the accompanying statement was read as setting a more optimistic tone about economic prospects than had been anticipated and prompted investors to mark up their expectations for the near-term path of policy.  That sentiment was apparently reinforced over the remainder of the period by the comments of several Federal Reserve officials and the release of the August employment report, which seemed to convey the view that the economy was emerging from its \"soft patch.\"  As a result, policy rate expectations for the next two quarters ended the intermeeting period slightly firmer.  Longer-term policy expectations, however, moved noticeably lower, reflecting the release of relatively benign readings on inflation and the Chairman\\'s comments on the inflation outlook in testimony to the House Budget Committee.  In line with these revised expectations for the path of policy, the term structure of interest rates flattened over the intermeeting period, as the two-year Treasury yield ended about unchanged and the ten-year Treasury yield dropped somewhat.  While credit spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds narrowed a bit, spreads on speculative-grade issues fell significantly more, particularly in riskier segments of the market, probably reflecting greater confidence about prospects in the business sector.  Further evidence of such confidence was visible in equity markets, where broad indexes advanced 5½ to 7½ percent.  The exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies was about unchanged over the intermeeting period.M2 balances were about flat on average over the previous two months:  After contracting a bit in July, M2 expanded slightly in August.  Money growth was damped by a rise in the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets (as typically occurs in periods of policy tightening).  In addition, the lift to M2 from mortgage refinancings in evidence during the spring was likely still unwinding over the past couple of months, depressing the growth of liquid deposits.  Business loans at banks expanded in August for the third consecutive month.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue expanding at a solid pace through the end of 2006.  Labor market improvements and accommodative monetary policy were seen as counterbalancing the drag from the swing in fiscal policy from considerable stimulus this year to modest restraint next year.  Consumer spending was expected to pick up in conjunction with the strengthening labor market and associated gains in wages and salaries that would offset the effects of an anticipated rise in the savings rate from its recent low level.  The contour of business spending was expected to be affected by the expiration of the partial-expensing tax provisions at year-end, which gave an incentive for businesses to invest more heavily this year.  Supported by a favorable financing environment, ample stocks of liquid assets, and the ongoing need to replace aging or obsolete equipment and software, investment outlays were expected to grow robustly once the tax-related swings were completed.  After the current period of below-average employment gains, employers were expected to hire at a relatively robust pace next year.  At the same time, as labor market conditions improved, individuals who had withdrawn from the labor force were thought likely to return, so that job gains were expected to have a muted effect on the unemployment rate.  Consumer price inflation was projected to remain at or below its current level.  Slack in resource utilization, continued rapid growth in structural productivity, and the pass-through of declining energy prices were expected to contribute to the restraint on inflation.In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective developments, the members agreed that the economy had strengthened somewhat after going through a \"soft patch\" in late spring and early summer.  Recent data and anecdotal information suggested solid growth ahead, but at a pace that could well be less brisk than previously anticipated.  Consumer spending appeared to have rebounded in the third quarter.  Business investment also was robust, but executives, especially those at larger firms, seemed more cautious about the outlook than they had been several months ago.  Although higher energy prices had played an important role in damping growth, questions remained about the reasons for the shortfall from expectations held this spring, and several policymakers remarked that their uncertainty about the likely pace of the expansion going forward had risen.  Members commented that the benign incoming data on prices tended to confirm their previous judgment that the increase in inflation earlier in the year had importantly reflected temporary factors and that core inflation would probably remain relatively low.In their discussion of developments in key sectors of the economy, policymakers agreed that business investment would most likely continue to provide considerable impetus to the overall economic expansion going forward.  The anticipated further expansion of aggregate demand should boost investment.  Also, low real interest rates, strong business balance sheets, and high levels of profits and cash flow were expected to support capital spending.  However, the extent to which the federal tax provision permitting partial expensing of most investment expenditures had been boosting capital expenditures was difficult to discern, and it was possible that the expiration of that provision at year-end could result in a fairly sharp slowing in investment, at least for a time.  In addition, recent discussions with business contacts, as well as a range of statistical information, suggested a persisting tendency for corporate executives to limit capital spending commitments.  The reasons for this tendency were unclear, but a continuing focus on corporate governance issues might still be playing a role, and business concerns about terrorism and other geopolitical risks might have risen this year.  Some members also noted that the pace of technological advance could be slowing a bit, trimming the rate of decline in the cost of capital for high-tech equipment and software.  High vacancy rates for office buildings and industrial structures would likely continue to weigh on nonresidential investment, although activity in that sector was showing some signs of revival.Committee members interpreted recent data and anecdotal information as indicating that growth in consumer spending was rebounding fr om its relatively slow rate of late spring.  They saw household spending as most likely continuing to expand at a solid pace going forward.  Gains in nominal income, partly resulting from gradual increases in employment, were expected to continue to support consumer spending and low interest rates to buoy residential investment.  However, members perceived several possible sources of downside risk to household spending.  In particular, households might hold back on spending in an attempt to increase their saving, which had fallen to a very low level relative to income.  The ebbing of stimulus from last year\\'s tax cuts also could tend to slow growth in consumer spending.  And a failure of employment to accelerate as expected could undermine consumer confidence as well as hold down the growth in personal income.With regard to the external sector, foreign economies were seen as generally expanding steadily, with the high level of crude oil prices apparently having restrained growth abroad somewhat less than in the United States.  Still, expectations for foreign economic growth had been marked down somewhat, with adverse implications for U.S. exports and for overall U.S. growth.  Indeed, some policymakers noted that domestic demand in several major U.S. trading partners was relatively weak and that aggregate demand in those economies was being sustained importantly by exports to the United States.  That pattern was contributing to a worrisome further widening of the U.S. trade and current account balances, and the Committee discussed the significance of wide external deficits and various adjustments that might occur in the process of their return to more sustainable levels.Committee members generally viewed labor market conditions as having improved modestly of late.  Although payroll growth had been weak in June and July, it registered a somewhat better performance in August, and initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to hover around relatively low levels.  Some members noted a mismatch between demand and supply for certain types of labor.  In particular, unskilled workers were said to be having considerable difficulty finding jobs, while firms were facing challenges in hiring workers with some specific skills, including truck drivers and heavy-equipment operators.  Partly as a result, businesses in a few sectors, such as transportation and construction, reportedly were experiencing constraints on their output.  Overall, however, some slack appeared to remain in labor markets.  Looking forward, policymakers expected gradual improvement in labor market conditions as the economy expanded.  However, anecdotal information suggested that many firms remained quite cautious about expanding payrolls, citing, among other factors, continued uncertainty about economic prospects and the high cost of providing health care benefits.Partly reflecting the likely persistence of some economic slack, members expected inflation to stay low.  Although non-energy commodity prices remained relatively high, energy prices had declined noticeably from record levels in recent weeks, and the effects of the energy price shock on inflation were expected to wane.  In this regard, a number of policymakers commented that data on consumer and producer inflation had generally come in at or below expectations over the intermeeting period, tending to confirm the Committee\\'s judgment that the upturn in inflation earlier in the year had owed importantly to temporary factors.  Moreover, inflation expectations appeared to be well-contained, although those expectations probably were conditioned in part on investors\\' anticipation that the stance of monetary policy would likely be tightened over time.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all of the members favored raising the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1¾ percent at this meeting.  The expansion evidently was resilient and self-sustaining and appeared no longer to require the unusual degree of monetary stimulus that had previously been necessary.  A gradual increase in interest rates seemed likely to be consistent with continued solid economic growth that would be sufficient to erode remaining margins of slack in resource utilization over time.  In view of these considerations, the Committee believed that another modest reduction in the degree of monetary policy accommodation at today\\'s meeting was warranted.  With today\\'s action, the real federal funds rate--measured as the difference between the nominal funds rate and a moving average of core PCE inflation--would move slightly into positive territory.With regard to the Committee\\'s announcement to be released after the meeting, the members agreed that the statement should indicate that, after moderating earlier in the year, partly in response to the substantial rise in energy prices, output growth appeared to have regained some traction and that labor market conditions had improved modestly.  In addition, policymakers concurred that the statement should indicate that inflation and inflation expectations had eased in recent months.  They also agreed again to characterize the risks to sustainable growth and price stability as balanced.  Members commented that recent evidence had boosted their confidence that moderate economic growth would continue and that inflation would be contained.  With aggregate demand probably expanding at least as rapidly as the economy\\'s potential to produce over the next several quarters, policymakers continued to see economic conditions as likely to warrant a further reduction in policy accommodation in coming quarters.  However, in the view of many members, policy actions would need to be increasingly keyed to incoming data.  Indeed, it was noted that market participants now appeared to anticipate some slowing in the pace of policy firming before long and did not interpret the removal of policy accommodation at a measured rate as necessarily involving the same policy action at each meeting.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive.\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 1¾ percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\"Votes for this action:Messrs. Greenspan, Geithner, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kohn, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Olson, Ms. Pianalto, and Mr. Poole. Vote against this action: None. The Committee noted that Deputy Secretary Normand R. V. Bernard had announced his intention to retire in the period before the next FOMC meeting, following more than four decades at the Federal Reserve.  The Committee thanked Mr. Bernard for his dedication, integrity, and steadfast support through the more than 345 FOMC meetings he attended during his career.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Wednesday, November 10, 2004.The meeting adjourned at 1:15 p.m. ', 'Minutes of the Federal Open Market CommitteeNovember 10, 2004 A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held in the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, November 10, 2004, at 9:00 a.m. Present:Mr. Greenspan, Chairman\\tMr. Geithner, Vice Chairman\\tMr. Bernanke\\tMs. BiesMr. FergusonMr. Gramlich Mr. HoenigMr. KohnMs. MinehanMr. OlsonMs. PianaltoMr. Poole\\tMessrs.

Danker as Deputy Secretary of the Committee to serve until the selection of a successor at the first regularly scheduled meeting after December 31, 2004.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\x92s account in the period since the previous meeting.The Manager reported on recent developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period September 21, 2004, through November 9, 2004.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Manager also discussed the pressures on the federal funds rate prior to, and volatility in the rate that has ensued at times after, recent FOMC meetings as depository institutions sought to satisfy a larger portion of their reserve requirements before anticipated increases in the FOMC\\x92s target funds rate.  The Committee agreed that the Desk would continue to conduct open market operations as it has in such situations--leaning against anticipatory pressures in the funds market while taking account of the reserve management implications of such operations for the remainder of the reserve maintenance period.  The information received at this meeting suggested that the economy expanded at a moderate pace over the third quarter.  Low interest rates helped to maintain a buoyant housing market and spending by both consumers and businesses was firm.  Available information suggested that the recent tempo of economic activity continued into the current quarter despite the restraint imparted on real incomes and consumer confidence from higher oil prices.  However, industrial production was flat in recent months, and hiring activity was lackluster through September before advancing sharply in October.  Inflation measures continued at low levels through September.Employment gains were subdued in the third quarter, but showed substantial strength in October.  Job growth last month was fairly widespread, although heavy hiring in the construction sector was due partly to efforts to repair damage from the four hurricanes that hit the southeastern states.  Employment increases were particularly large in the financial and services sectors.  However, a small decline was registered in employment in the manufacturing sector.  The average workweek held steady in October at its third-quarter level and was a bit above the average for the second quarter.  Despite the strong increase in payroll employment, the household survey indicated a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent in October.Industrial production was about unchanged in September, likely restrained by the hurricanes that month.  A decline in manufacturing was about offset by a jump in utilities output and expansion in high-tech industries.  The available data suggested that industrial production rebounded in October.  Capacity utilization was unchanged in September at about the third-quarter average but was up from its level earlier in the year.Consumer spending advanced strongly in the third quarter from the sluggish pace of the second quarter.  The acceleration reflected a surge in expenditures on motor vehicles that owed partly to attractive incentives, but spending on other durables and nondurables was also up.  Spending on services was steady for the third quarter on average, but advanced in September on a boost to electricity consumption related to unseasonably warm weather.  Real disposable income slowed in the third quarter to a moderate pace and was flat in September, probably in part because of effects of the hurricanes.  Measures of consumer confidence moved down in September and again in October.  Activity in housing markets remained generally strong in September, supported by favorable mortgage rates.  Although starts of single-family homes slowed to well below the level of preceding months, multifamily starts rose and sales of both existing and new homes were elevated. Business investment spending on equipment and software continued to expand at a rapid pace in the third quarter, supported by positive fundamentals that included robust business output, low interest rates and readily available credit, and healthy business balance sheets.  Outlays for high-tech equipment and software stepped down in the third quarter, but spending on other types of equipment, including transportation, was at a high level.  At the same time, investment in nonresidential structures, which had turned up in the second quarter, softened in the third quarter.  Construction spending for retail buildings and warehouses advanced, but high vacancy rates for office buildings held back investment in that sector.Accumulation of nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles picked up smartly over the third quarter.  The level of sales also rose, however, keeping inventory-sales ratios fairly steady at low levels.The U.S. international trade deficit rose in the third quarter on average, reflecting some weakening in the growth of service exports and an increase in the price and quantity of petroleum imports.  The deficit narrowed in September, however, as imports fell while exports expanded moderately.  The lower level of imports in September mainly reflected declines in the petroleum and services categories.  Economic expansion abroad on average appeared to slow in the third quarter, although it remained solid.  Consumer prices continued to advance at a moderate rate in recent months, although both overall and core consumer price measures rose a bit faster in the twelve months ending in September 2004 than in the year-earlier period.  Expectations of near-term inflation picked up in October, consistent with the increase in energy prices.  Labor costs continued to rise moderately.  The increase in the employment cost index for private compensation over the third quarter was a bit below the average pace of the last two years.At its meeting of September 21, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee adopted a directive that called for conditions in reserves markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 1-¾ percent.  In its public statement, the Committee expressed a belief that monetary policy remained accommodative even after this tightening, and judged the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability over the next few quarters to be roughly equal.  The Committee noted its expectation that the underlying rate of inflation would continue to be low and that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured, but also stated that it would nonetheless respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.The FOMC\\x92s decision in September to raise the intended level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points and its attendant public statement were anticipated by the market, and the reaction was muted.  Over subsequent weeks, however, a reference in the minutes of the August FOMC meeting to the need for \"significant cumulative tightening\" and comments by the Chairman and other FOMC members, which were read as minimizing the likely damping effect on the economy of higher energy prices, led markets to raise their expectations of forthcoming policy tightenings.  These expectations were boosted further by the release of the strong employment data for October.  The shift in the market\\x92s outlook for monetary policy contributed to noticeable upward pressure on short-term interest rates, and most long-term rates also moved up.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds rose about in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasuries, but yields on speculative-grade bonds edged down and equity markets posted strong advances.  In foreign exchange markets, the dollar declined appreciably, apparently in part on continuing market concerns about the financing of the U.S. current account deficit.M2 expanded in October at about the sluggish pace of the third quarter.  The growth of M2 was restrained in recent months by increases in its opportunity cost.  Rates paid on its liquid asset components have lagged increases in market rates associated with the three monetary tightenings since midyear. In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expand next year at around this year\\x92s solid pace under an assumption of generally accommodative financial conditions.  Recent declines in the dollar were expected to support domestic economic activity by boosting net exports.  Fiscal policy was expected to become much less stimulative after the current quarter, owing to the expiration of the temporary partial-expensing provisions of the tax code.  Oil prices were anticipated to decline somewhat with the repair of hurricane-related damage to oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to some slowing in inflation.  With the economy expected to advance over the coming year at a rate a bit above its longer-run potential, the pace of hiring should firm and the unemployment rate should edge lower.  In response to rising real incomes, consumer spending was forecast to strengthen after the early part of next year.  The staff expected business investment spending to slow sharply early next year as partial-expensing provisions expired, but then to pick up noticeably in response to favorable financing conditions, ample business liquidity, and the need to replace or upgrade aging equipment and software.In the Committee\\x92s discussion of current and prospective developments, the members generally expressed assessments that economic expansion in the neighborhood of the rate of growth of the economy\\x92s potential appeared to have become even more firmly established over recent months, despite the drag from higher energy prices.  Recent data and anecdotal information suggested that spending by businesses and households had been reasonably robust of late, supported by accommodative financial conditions, continuing gains in productivity, and increasing employment.  Looking forward, economic fundamentals appeared to be favorable for continued solid growth, and while fiscal stimulus would abate next year, a flattening out of energy prices, as markets seemed to anticipate, would bolster economic expansion.  However, significant uncertainties surrounded the prospects for energy prices and fiscal policy, as well as the external sector.  The Committee anticipated that underlying inflation pressures would remain contained as monetary accommodation was withdrawn.  Core consumer price inflation had been quite damped on average in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored, despite further increases in energy prices and prospective increases in near-term headline inflation.In their discussion of key sectors of the economy, policymakers noted that business investment had been expanding robustly and was likely to continue to be buoyed by the strength of productivity and profits.  Some sectors, such as trucks and heavy equipment, had experienced rapid growth.  However, even after taking account of likely effects of higher oil prices, the pace of overall business investment spending was still boosting GDP growth somewhat less than might have been expected given accommodative financial conditions and tax incentives.  Some uncertainties, such as those associated with the election, had been resolved, but others persisted, including the prospects for oil prices and their consequences for the economy.  Many business firms seemed hesitant about large-scale investment to increase productive capacity and hiring commitments, perhaps partly reflecting an environment of greater scrutiny regarding corporate governance and internal control systems.  The high-tech sector, and investment in information technology more generally, had been growing less rapidly of late and was seen as posing a possible downside risk to the outlook.  If the recent slower rate of price declines on high-tech products implied a softer underlying pace of technological change, both the outlook for investment demand and the prospects for persisting high trend growth in productivity could be damped relative to previous expectations.While acknowledging data indicating a rebound in consumption spending in recent months, Committee members reported contacts with retail merchants that suggested mixed readings on the ongoing pace of consumer buying.  The effect of higher energy prices on real incomes was likely still restraining consumer spending.  Moreover, the stock of automobiles owned by households had risen substantially in recent years, and the willingness of households to purchase autos was seen as continuing to depend importantly on the provision of incentives by manufacturers.  Home buying and residential construction generally remained robust, although a few members pointed to some moderation in activity in selected markets.  It was noted that a slowdown in the rate of increase in home prices going forward might lead households to increase their desired saving.  However, the risk of any significant drop-off in the growth of consumer spending would likely diminish with a sustained rebound in the pace of hiring.In their comments on fiscal policy, Committee members indicated an expectation that the economic stimulus provided in recent years by discretionary fiscal measures was likely to fade next year.  However, considerable uncertainty surrounded the likely evolution of the federal budget.  Members stressed the importance of fiscal discipline to facilitate a better balance between net national saving and investment and thereby promote an adjustment of the imbalance in the current account of the balance of payments.Committee members noted that the balance of trade had improved a little in September and commented that the decline in the value of the dollar over the past few years had been boosting demand seen by some exporting firms.  However, with foreign economic growth moderating and the large excess of imports over exports, members generally viewed the prospects for net exports as likely to provide a continuing drag on U.S. economic expansion.   One implication of this outlook was that U.S. external indebtedness relative to GDP would be increasing further.Committee members remarked on signs of improvement in labor market conditions.  While acknowledging the need to be cautious about readings from a single labor market report, members saw the increase in payroll employment in October and the upward revisions to previous months as encouraging.  Furthermore, business contacts in several regions were indicating greater difficulty in filling some types of positions, both skilled and unskilled.  Nevertheless, many firms evidently remained slow to expand hiring, in part because of rising benefit costs.  One member commented on the performance of a few key industries, citing evidence that the job losses since the business cycle peak had been driven primarily by weak demand rather than productivity improvements.  Although the extent of economic slack was uncertain, some members indicated a sense that the economy needed to grow faster than trend in order to take up remaining unused resources.Wage and price pressures were generally still modest.  While some firms reportedly were finding it easier to pass higher oil and other commodity costs on to their business customers, most business contacts indicated considerable difficulty in passing cost increases on to consumers.  Longer-term inflation expectations had remained reasonably low, helping to restrain the spillover of elevated energy prices to the prices of other goods and services.  Some members noted that any remaining resource slack would probably exert downward pressure on inflation and that the depreciation of the dollar seemed to be having a muted effect on import prices to date.  However, upside risks to the inflation outlook included possible further depreciation of the dollar or increases in energy prices.  In addition, a few members cited the possibility that the elevated pace of trend productivity growth experienced since the mid-1990s would begin to slow.In the Committee\\x92s discussion of the setting of policy, all of the members favored raising the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2 percent at this meeting.  The economy appeared to be continuing to expand at a moderate pace that was likely to be rapid enough to gradually reduce margins of underutilized resources.  In that regard, the Committee was encouraged by more evident signs of improvement in hiring.  The Committee felt that the outlook justified the further removal of the policy accommodation that had been appropriate when the economic expansion was more tentative.  Today\\x92s action would move the real funds rate, measured using core PCE inflation, toward a more positive setting.In discussing the FOMC announcement for this meeting and going forward, several members commented that policy actions would likely become increasingly dependent on incoming data and their implications for future activity and prices.  This might imply a more gradual path of tightening going forward than that of the last several months, as for example now seemed to be built into the term structure of interest rates, or it might mean that the Committee on occasion would need to firm policy more rapidly.  A few members felt that, because of greater uncertainties, it might become appropriate eventually to move away from the recent practice of providing guidance about the likely future path of policy, while others emphasized the desirability of continuing to be as informative as possible about the Committee\\x92s perceived outlook.  For now, most members agreed that the current statement language provided considerable flexibility with regard to the Committee\\x92s future actions and that market participants understood that flexibility.  As regards the announcement to be released after the meeting, most members felt that little change in the statement language was required.  Policymakers concurred that the statement should indicate that output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, that labor market conditions have improved, and that inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.  They agreed to characterize the risks to sustainable growth and price stability as balanced and to reiterate that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured but that the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive.\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 2 percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to beroughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, theCommittee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that islikely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\"Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Geithner, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig, Kohn, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Olson, Ms. Pianalto, and Mr. Poole. Vote against this action: None.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\x92s account in the period since the previous meeting.\\tThe Manager also reported on recent developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period November 10, 2004, through December 13, 2004.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information received at this meeting suggested that the economy expanded at a moderate pace over the third quarter and into the current quarter.  Consumer spending was solid, and investment spending remained strong.  Manufacturing production increased at a modest pace, and employment gains in October and November indicated that the labor market continued to improve gradually.  Core inflation measures remained subdued, albeit running at a slightly higher pace than last year, owing, in part, to the indirect effects of higher energy prices.Gains in employment were moderate in November after a surge in October.  Job growth was fairly widespread, with the exception of slightly weak seasonal hiring in the retail sector.  Construction employment grew rapidly in November even after the outsized gains in October due to hurricane-related repair work.  In contrast, employment in manufacturing edged lower.  The average workweek in November was a touch below its level in October, but still a bit above the third-quarter average.  The unemployment rate ticked down to 5.4 percent in November.Industrial production expanded a little more slowly in November than it had in recent months.  Output at mines increased noticeably for a second month, and manufacturing output posted a moderate gain.  At utilities, output fell back in November after large increases in the preceding two months.  Utilization rates moved higher in November.Consumer spending appeared to be expanding at a more moderate pace in the fourth quarter, after growing at a robust rate in the third quarter.  Although sales of motor vehicles declined in November, spending on other goods rose further after the large increase posted in October.  Spending on services continued to register solid gains.  Real disposable income, restrained by sharply higher energy prices, rose slightly.  Even so, measures of consumer confidence were little changed and remained consistent with sustained increases in spending.Activity in housing markets, buoyed by mortgage rates only modestly above their recent lows, remained strong in October.  Starts of both single-family and multifamily homes increased and were above their third-quarter levels.  Home sales remained at near-record levels.Shipments of nondefense capital goods stepped up in October against the backdrop of solid expansion in business output, low user cost of capital, and an ample stock of liquid assets in the corporate sector.  Shipments of computers jumped in October, while gains in the transportation sector were more modest.  Outside the high-tech and transportation sectors, shipments moved up considerably in October from their robust third-quarter pace.  Outlays on nonresidential construction edged down in October.After a rapid rise in the third quarter, nonfarm inventories appeared to accumulate at a moderate pace in October.  The book value of manufacturers\\x92 inventories increased notably; however, shipments also stepped up, an increase that left the inventory-shipments ratio in this sector unchanged.The U.S. international trade deficit widened in October, primarily because of a surge in merchandise imports.  Economic activity in most of the major foreign industrial countries slowed in the third quarter, and data for the fourth quarter pointed to continued subpar growth.Consumer prices jumped in October, as hurricane damage contributed to higher prices for food and energy.  For the twelve months ending in October, consumer prices rose considerably faster than they did in the year-earlier period.  Core consumer prices increased much more modestly in October than did overall consumer prices, although the twelve-month change for core prices was also somewhat higher than it was a year before.  The employment cost index for private compensation advanced moderately in the year ending the third quarter, and the markup of prices over labor costs remained somewhat elevated.At its meeting on November 10, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted a directive that called for conditions in reserves markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 2 percent.  In its public statement, the Committee expressed a belief that monetary policy remained accommodative even after this tightening and judged that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability over the next few quarters were roughly equal.  The Committee noted its expectation that the underlying rate of inflation would continue to be low and that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured, but it also stated that it would nonetheless respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.The FOMC\\x92s decision in November to raise the intended federal funds rate 25 basis points and its attendant public statement were apparently anticipated by the market, so that the reaction was muted.  Subsequently, higher-than-expected inflation data, remarks by the Chairman that were viewed as pointing to future rate increases, and the depreciation of the dollar all led market participants to price in a somewhat steeper path for future policy.  The upward revision in policy expectations prompted modest increases in shorter-term Treasury coupon security yields.  The yield on the ten-year Treasury note, however, was unchanged on net.  Yields on both investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds edged lower.  The value of the dollar relative to other major currencies declined. M2 accelerated a bit in November from its sluggish pace in October, but growth in money continued to be restrained by increases in its opportunity cost.  Rates paid on the liquid components of M2 lagged increases in market rates associated with the monetary policy tightenings this year.  Bank credit rebounded in November, with both securities and loans registering gains.In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expand at a moderate pace, supported by accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions.  Consistent with readings from futures markets, oil prices were anticipated to edge lower.  With economic activity projected to expand at a pace a little above that of its longer-run potential over the coming year, hiring was projected to continue to firm, causing the unemployment rate to edge down next year.  The steep run-up in housing prices, recent increases in equity prices, and anticipated gains in payrolls were viewed as likely to boost the growth of consumption spending next year to a pace somewhat above that recorded this year.  Business investment was anticipated to decline a bit early next year in light of the expiration of the partial-expensing tax provision at the end of 2004 but was projected to resume vigorous growth in response to a favorable economic outlook, supportive financial conditions, ample liquid assets in the corporate sector, and an ongoing need to replace or upgrade aging equipment and software.  Measures of total consumer price inflation were expected to decline from current levels reflecting the direct effect of the downturn in energy prices.  By contrast, core inflation was seen in the staff forecast as remaining stable.  The upward pressure on inflation from a slight step-down in structural productivity growth and a narrowing margin of resource slack was expected to be about counterbalanced by diminishing pressure from the pass-through of the earlier rise in energy prices and decline in the dollar.In their discussion of the economic outlook, the participants at the meeting (the members of the Board of Governors and the Reserve Bank Presidents or those acting in their place) generally regarded incoming data since the prior meeting as consistent with an expectation that the economy would continue to expand at a pace that would likely prove sufficient to reduce margins of underutilized resources further.  Recent data and anecdotal information indicated that the economic expansion was firmly established and had proven quite resilient in the face of rising oil prices and the reduction in policy accommodation.  Although the November employment report had been disappointing, when viewed over several months, labor market conditions were generally seen as gradually improving.  That improvement was expected to persist and, along with higher wealth and relatively low interest rates, would support further gains in spending by households.  Rising demand, elevated underlying productivity growth, and accommodative financial conditions should keep business spending on a strong uptrend.  With some economic slack persisting and longer-term inflation expectations well-anchored, inflation was anticipated to remain subdued.  A number of participants cited the recent depreciation of the dollar on foreign exchange markets, elevated energy costs, and the possibility of a slowing in underlying productivity growth as factors tending to boost the upside risks to their inflation outlook, though, on net, they saw the risks to stable underlying inflation as still balanced.In their discussion of important sectors of the economy, participants noted that increasing equity and home prices had boosted household net worth, leaving consumers well positioned to maintain a brisk pace of spending.  Continued gains in employment were thought likely to provide additional support to spending by bolstering consumer confidence and income.  Participants commented that real disposable incomes should receive a further lift from the recent drop in oil prices.  Moreover, intermediate- and long-term interest rates remained low in both nominal and real terms despite the recent firming in the stance of policy, encouraging spending on consumer durables and housing.Many of the fundamentals underlying the demand for capital goods\\x97expanding output, a low cost of capital, strong profits, and ample liquid assets\\x97appeared quite favorable, and participants generally were upbeat in their assessment of the prospects for investment.  While some participants noted that their business contacts seemed more confident about the future and that the sense of caution previously evident in business spending and hiring behavior seemed to be waning, others believed that many businesses remained quite wary.  Most participants acknowledged some significant uncertainties in their outlook, including the effects of the expiration of the partial-expensing provision for investment at the end of 2004 and recent indications of a softening in high-tech spending in the United States and elsewhere.  The possible downshift in the pace of high-tech spending also raised the possibility of an erosion of profit margins that could result from a slackening in the pace of technology-led productivity growth and the associated increase in cost pressures.A number of participants voiced concerns about domestic and global financial imbalances.  On the domestic front, such concerns focused on the magnitude of current and projected fiscal deficits, which seemed likely to keep national saving low.  Views about the prospects for fiscal restraint in the years ahead were mixed; some participants believed that the odds of significant deficit reduction over the next few years were remote while others were more optimistic.  Regarding global imbalances and the current account deficit in the United States, a number of participants expressed doubts that such imbalances would be reduced in the near-term.  Better global balance would require not only greater national saving in the United States but also a notable strengthening in domestic demand among major trading partners.  Such a strengthening seemed unlikely in the near term given the recent softening in the economies of several important industrial countries.In their discussion of financial market conditions, participants noted that investors anticipated further increases in the federal funds rate over the coming year, but intermediate- and long-term interest rates along with financial conditions more generally had remained quite supportive of growth.  A few participants commented that the generally low level of interest rates across a wide range of maturities and the recent flattening of the slope of the yield curve (measured as the spread between ten- and two-year Treasury yields) might signal that expectations of longer-term growth had been marked down.  Some participants believed that the prolonged period of policy accommodation had generated a significant degree of liquidity that might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risk-taking in financial markets evidenced by quite narrow credit spreads, a pickup in initial public offerings, an upturn in mergers and acquisition activity, and anecdotal reports that speculative demands were becoming apparent in the markets for single-family homes and condominiums.Although the November employment report had been disappointing and recent readings on initial claims for unemployment insurance had risen, participants viewed labor market conditions still as improving gradually.  Averaging over recent months, or even the entire year, employment growth had been fast enough to absorb unutilized labor resources over time.  Anecdotal information suggested a significant tightening in the market for skilled workers in some industries and regions, although demand for less skilled workers still appeared soft.  Recent surveys of hiring plans by businesses were read as signaling future gains in employment.  Despite the further improvement in labor markets, a number of participants noted that wage and compensation increases had not picked up materially and generally remained moderate.In their discussion of the outlook for prices, a number of participants cited developments that could pose upside inflation risks.  Although oil prices had fallen of late, they were still considerably higher than they had been in the spring, and the recent decline in the dollar would raise import prices and diminish competitive pressures on many industries.  The pass-through from both sources should be limited, but they were still a potential source of upward pressure on prices that could get embedded in higher inflation under certain circumstances.  In addition, productivity growth had slowed appreciably in the most recent quarter and unit labor costs had increased, raising questions about cost pressures going forward.  A few participants also noted that uncertainty about the extent of resource slack in the economy was considerable and that it was quite possible that the economy could soon be operating close to potential, particularly if labor force participation rates did not turn up much while employment continued to register gains.  The increase over the last few months in five-year measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury nominal and inflation-indexed securities might be a warning sign that expectations were not as well anchored as they had been over the summer.Despite these concerns, participants generally expected that inflation would remain low in the foreseeable future.  While the depreciation of the dollar over recent months had been notable, some participants found persuasive the evidence from recent studies pointing to a decline over time and across countries in the pass-through of exchange rate movements into domestic prices.  Forward market-based measures of inflation compensation beyond the next five years as well as survey measures of both short- and long-term inflation expectations had been quite stable of late, despite the previous rise in energy prices and the lower dollar.  Moreover, several participants cited factors that likely would continue to provide a counterweight to any upside risks.  Although participants generally acknowledged that the degree of economic slack was quite uncertain, the moderate pace of wage and compensation growth in recent months in the face of higher energy prices and several years of rapid productivity growth was consistent with an economy still operating somewhat below its potential.  In a similar vein, the recent quarterly dip in productivity growth notwithstanding, there were no clear signs that underlying productivity had slowed appreciably of late, and a close reading of recent history suggested that upside risks to the outlook for productivity growth could be significant.  Even if structural productivity growth were to slow, price markups remained quite elevated and some participants noted that further increases in unit labor costs could well be absorbed for some time by a return of markups to more normal levels.In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all of the members (the members of the Board of Governors and the five voting Reserve Bank Presidents) favored raising the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2¼ percent at this meeting.  All members judged that a further quarter-point tightening in the target federal funds rate at this meeting was appropriate in light of the prospects for solid growth and diminished slack.  Even with this action, the current level of the real funds rate target remained below the level it most likely would need to reach to keep inflation stable and output at its potential.  With the economic expansion more firmly entrenched, cost and price pressures were likely to become a clearer intermediate-term risk to sustained good economic performance absent further reduction of accommodation.With regard to the Committee's announcement to be released after the meeting, members generally agreed that overall economic prospects were similar to those prevailing at the time of the November meeting and that consequently the statement should be altered only to the minor extent required to reflect recent economic developments.  They concurred that the statement should note that output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the earlier rise in energy prices, that labor market conditions continue to improve gradually, and that inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well-contained.  They also agreed again to characterize the risks to sustainable growth and price stability as balanced.  A few members believed that the Committee\\x92s flexibility would be enhanced by eliminating the forward-looking elements of the Committee\\x92s statement referring to the pace of removal of policy accommodation.  More of the members believed that this language was useful in conveying the Committee\\x92s sense of the outlook for the economy and the stance of monetary policy and was appropriately conditioned on economic developments.  All members agreed that the FOMC statement for this meeting should again indicate that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured but that the Committee would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive.\\x93The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 2¼ percent.\\x94The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\\x93The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to beroughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, theCommittee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that islikely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\\x94Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, Geithner, Bernanke, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Ferguson, Gramlich, Hoenig,Kohn, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Olson, Ms. Pianalto, and Mr. Poole.Vote against this action: None. The meeting then turned to consideration of releasing FOMC minutes on an accelerated schedule.  Meeting participants agreed that an experiment with accelerating the preparation of the minutes that had been conducted since early in the year had been successful in identifying the procedural changes that would be necessary if an accelerated schedule were to be followed going forward.  Participants noted that the minutes contained a more complete and nuanced explanation of the reasons for the Committee\\x92s decisions and view of the risks to the outlook than was possible in the post-meeting announcement, and their earlier release would help markets interpret economic developments and predict the course of interest rates.  They also would provide the public a more up-to-date context for individual policymakers\\x92 public remarks.  Meeting participants supported the principle of openness and transparency, but debated the possibility that the markets would misinterpret the minutes and that the prospect of early release would lead to either less productive discussions at the meetings or to less comprehensive, and therefore less useful, minutes.  A few participants expressed support for trimming the length and forward-looking elements of the post-meeting announcements, should the Committee decide to accelerate release of the minutes.  Others, however, preferred not to link the two decisions or viewed the more extensive announcements as useful regardless of the minutes\\x92 publication schedule.The clear consensus of the participants at the meeting was to release the minutes on an expedited schedule, and the Committee voted unanimously to begin publishing the minutes of regularly scheduled meetings three weeks after the day of the policy decision.  The minutes of any other Committee meetings, such as conference calls, would be handled somewhat differently.  In those cases, if a policy action were taken, an announcement of that action would be made as soon as practicably possible.  If, however, no action were taken, the fact that the conference call took place would be reflected in the statement following the subsequent regular meeting, and, in any case, the minutes of the call would be released along with the minutes of the subsequent regular meeting.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, February 1-2, 2005.The meeting adjourned at 1:25 p.m.Vincent R.

The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swapdrawings by the System and about any operations that are not of a routine character.By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations wasamended and approved in the form shown below. The amendment involved removing fromparagraph 1(a) the reference to the limit on the amount by which the System Open Market Accountholdings of securities can change between FOMC meetings. This limit had become outdated, as ithad been superseded by other, more effective mechanisms for the Committee to oversee Deskoperations.AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS(Amended February 1, 2005)1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at ameeting of the Committee:(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal FinancingBank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interestby, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreignand international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash,regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, forsuch Account, to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with theTreasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement;(b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fullyguaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for theaccount of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of suchsecurities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expresslyauthorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applyingreasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in theevent Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchasedby the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market ortransferred to the System Open Market Account.(c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct obligations of, or fullyguaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States to dealers for SystemOpen Market Account under agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligationsin 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee,shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume ofagreements with individual dealers.2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open MarketCommittee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S.Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall bedetermined by competitive bidding. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set a minimumlending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and apply reasonable limitations on thetotal amount of a specific issue that may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that eachdealer may borrow. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could facilitatea dealer\\'s ability to control a single issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork.3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in theprovision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the FederalReserve Bank of New York and accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York asfiscal agent of the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal Reserve Act, the FederalOpen Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) forSystem Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such accounts on the bases setforth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of thosesecurities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to those available on such transactions inthe market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers,subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b), repurchaseagreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale andrepurchase agreements between its own account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agencyaccounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisionsof this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.4. In the execution of the Committee\\x92s decision regarding policy during any intermeeting period,the Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instructionof the Chairman of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree ofpressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate. Any such adjustment shallbe made in the context of the Committee\\x92s discussion and decision at its most recent meeting andthe Committee\\x92s long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shallbe based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period.Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committeebefore making any adjustment.By unanimous vote, the Committee made several amendments to its rules, statements,and resolutions, including to align the starting dates of Committee membership terms of Presidents with those of Committee officers, and to authorize the Secretary of the Committee, with theconcurrence of the General Counsel, to make technical changes to the rules in the future.By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Program for Security of FOMCInformation on February 1, 2005, to reflect an updating and streamlining of the document.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments inforeign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for theSystem\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting. The Manager also reported ondevelopments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions ingovernment securities and federal agency obligations during the period December 14, 2004 toFebruary 1, 2005. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.At this meeting the Committee engaged in a broad-ranging discussion of the pros andcons of formulating a numerical definition of the price-stability objective of monetary policy. Astaff presentation on the topic included a review of the potential costs and benefits of introducingsuch a definition as well as of other countries\\x92 experiences. In the subsequent discussion, meetingparticipants uniformly agreed that price stability provided the best environment for maximizingsustainable economic growth in the long run, but expressed a range of views on whether it wouldbe helpful for the Committee to articulate a specific numerical definition for the Federal Reserve\\'sprice-stability objective--either a single figure or a range. Those who believed such a move wouldbe on balance beneficial cited, for example, its usefulness as an anchor for long-term inflationexpectations, as a vehicle for enhanced clarity of Committee deliberations, and as an additional toolfor communications. Several of those who saw greater potential drawbacks were concerned thatsuch a shift might appear to be inconsistent with the Committee\\x92s dual mandate of fosteringmaximum employment as well as price stability or that it might inappropriately bias or constrain policy at times; in any case, with inflation expectations well-contained over recent years, thebenefits of announcing a specific inflation objective were not likely to be large. The Committeedecided to defer further discussion.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy expanded at asolid pace in recent months. Consumer spending and the housing market continued to exhibitstrength, and business fixed investment grew robustly in the fourth quarter. The pace of inventoryaccumulation picked up and industrial production accelerated. The labor market showed furthersigns of improvement. Core consumer prices rose moderately over the past few months, andmeasures of inflation expectations remained well-anchored.Moderate increases in payroll employment during November and December pushed theaverage monthly advance in the quarter well above that of the third quarter. Employment gainswere fairly widespread, with hiring in business services, health care, financial activities, andwholesale trade more than offsetting continued sluggishness in manufacturing and a seasonallyadjusted decline in retail services during December. Surveys of employers\\x92 hiring plans and jobopenings pointed to continued moderate gains in employment early this year. The averageworkweek during the fourth quarter was unchanged from the third quarter, and as a result aggregatehours decelerated despite the pickup in employment growth. The unemployment rate held steady at5.4 percent in December.Industrial activity accelerated noticeably during the fourth quarter. The pickup ofindustrial production in December owed largely to increased motor vehicle assemblies and aturnaround in the output of utilities associated with cold weather across the northeast. Productionof high-tech goods slowed slightly in the fourth quarter. Available weekly physical product datasuggested that manufacturing production would increase moderately in January. Capacity utilization continued to climb through the end of the year but remained below its longer-runaverage.Real consumer spending expanded briskly in December and in the fourth quarter as awhole, with retail sales exhibiting widespread strength across categories. Expenditures onconsumer services also continued to post solid increases. A surge in light vehicle sales inDecember pulled the average rate of sales during the fourth quarter slightly above the third-quarterpace. Real disposable personal income increased at a rapid rate at the end of the year--boosted inpart by the special dividend payment by Microsoft; excluding this payment, real disposablepersonal income rose at a more moderate rate. Measures of consumer confidence remainedfavorable and consistent with sustained increases in spending.Residential housing activity remained buoyant in the fourth quarter. A rebound insingle-family housing starts in December from a disappointing November brought the fourthquarterpace about in line with that earlier in the year. Sales of new and existing homes slippedsome late in the year but remained robust. Mortgage rates had changed little since August andcontinued to support demand. Construction activity in the multifamily sector weakened a bit inNovember and December, but indicators of underlying demand pointed to a rebound in starts inJanuary.Business fixed investment continued to be bolstered by favorable fundamentals,including sustained expansion of business output, the flush cash position of many firms, readilyavailable credit, and a still-favorable cost of capital. Equipment and software spending grew at asolid rate in the fourth quarter, though not quite as briskly as in the third quarter owing to adeceleration in spending outside the high-tech sector. By contrast, investment in nonresidentialstructures had edged down in recent months, with expenditures only for drilling and mining operations showing some strength amid flat outlays for manufacturing facilities and a decline inspending on office buildings.Nonfarm inventories increased a bit more in the fourth quarter than they had in the thirdquarter. The buildup of inventories was widespread across manufacturers, wholesalers, andretailers as well as across stages of production. Motor vehicle inventories were an exception, asmotor vehicle manufacturers sought to reduce stocks of unsold light vehicles. The aggregateinventory-sales ratio outside of motor vehicles likely edged up in the fourth quarter but remainedwithin the range that had prevailed since the middle of last year.The most recent data suggested that the U.S. international trade deficit widened in thefourth quarter as a result of a broad-based decline in exports of goods and increase in imports of oiland consumer goods. The expansion in economic activity in the major foreign industrializedeconomies appeared to remain sluggish in the fourth quarter, but the growth of real GDP in LatinAmerica and emerging Asia likely stepped up.Core consumer prices decelerated over the past few months, while overall consumerprices were buffeted by movements in energy prices. The rate of increase in core prices in thetwelve months ending in December was somewhat higher than the very low rate that prevailedduring the year-earlier period; the overall index also accelerated, with about half of its advanceaccounted for by a sharp rise in energy prices. Measures of inflation expectations were littlechanged over the intermeeting period. With regard to labor costs, the employment cost indexdecelerated in the fourth quarter; the slowdown was attributable to wages, which gained onlyslightly, while benefit costs rose a bit faster than in the third quarter.At its meeting on December 14, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee decided toincrease its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2-1/4 percent. In its announcement of this decision, the Committee indicated that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of bothsustainable growth and price stability were roughly equal. The Committee also noted that outputappeared to be growing at a moderate pace and labor market conditions continued to improvegradually, while inflation and inflation expectations remained well-contained. As a result, theCommittee again judged that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely tobe measured, although the path of policy would depend importantly on evolving economicprospects.The Committee\\x92s decision at its December meeting to increase the federal funds rate hadbeen fully anticipated in financial markets, and reaction to the attendant statement was muted. Therelease of the minutes of the December meeting on January 4, however, triggered a significantupward revision in the anticipated path of monetary policy: Investors apparently read them asexpressing more widespread concern among Committee members about inflation pressures thanhad been the case previously. Market participants viewed the generally favorable incoming data oneconomic activity as consistent with their expectations of firmer policy. Interest rates onintermediate-term Treasury securities rose in response to the revision to policy expectations, butlonger-term yields were little changed over the intermeeting period. As yields on inflation-indexedTreasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflationcompensation remained about unchanged. Risk spreads on corporate bonds were stable atrelatively low levels, consistent with favorable indicators of corporate credit quality. Broad stockindexes declined a bit over the intermeeting period. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar endedthe period little changed on a trade-weighted basis, appreciating against the major Europeancurrencies but falling vis-à-vis other important trading partners.M2 grew moderately in recent months, its expansion restrained by rising opportunitycosts associated with monetary policy tightening. Because changes in interest rates on liquiddeposits typically lag those in market interest rates, the growth of that component slowed in thesecond half of 2004. By contrast, growth of small time deposits, whose yields closely track marketrates, picked up. Currency growth was about flat in December.In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expandat a pace a little above that of its longer-run potential over this year and next, while hiring wasexpected to firm some more, resulting in a further decrease in the unemployment rate. Householdspending was projected to grow at a fairly solid rate, supported by higher employment andsomewhat lower energy prices but damped somewhat by lessened stimulus from gains in wealthand the need for households to rebuild savings. After a temporary dip in the level of businessinvestment this quarter related to the expiration of the partial-expensing tax provision, investmentoutlays were seen as likely to resume vigorous growth in response to steadily rising sales, strongcorporate balance sheets, supportive financial conditions, and an ongoing need to replace orupgrade aging equipment and software. Real net exports were projected to be roughly stable forseveral quarters, held up by the lagged effect of the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar andsome strengthening in foreign demand. Measures of total consumer price inflation were expectedto decline over the forecast horizon as energy prices receded, while core inflation was seen asremaining stable in the staff forecast. Tendencies for core inflation to increase because of slightlyhigher trend unit labor costs and a narrowing margin of resource slack were expected to be offsetby the waning contribution of elevated prices for energy and imported goods.In their discussion of the economic outlook, the meeting participants regarded incomingdata since the last meeting as supporting their expectations that, with the further removal of monetary accommodation, GDP would likely grow at a moderate pace consistent with a gradualreduction of remaining economic slack, and inflation would probably continue to be low. Domesticdemand had stayed strong through the fourth quarter and should continue to be bolstered byfavorable financial conditions. Recent data indicated low and stable rates of core consumerinflation and apparently well-anchored inflation expectations. Against this backdrop, the risks tothe outlook for both output and inflation relative to the Committee\\'s goals appeared to remain well-balanced.In preparation for the Federal Reserve\\x92s semi-annual report to the Congress on theeconomy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of theFederal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate ofunemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2005 and 2006. As part of itscontinuing effort to improve its communications, the Committee had earlier decided to add oneyear to the forecast period so as to make the projections more useful to the public. The forecasts ofthe rate of expansion in real GDP were concentrated in the upper part of a 3-1/2 to 4 percent range for2005; for 2006 the forecasts were in a slightly lower range of 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 percent, with a centraltendency at 3-1/2 percent. These rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment ratein the range of 5 to 5-1/2 percent and a central tendency of 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005and 5 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006. The rate of inflation, as measured by the corePCE price index, was expected to remain fairly stable, with forecasts concentrated in the lowerportion of a 1-1/2 to 2 percent range for both this year and next.In their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy, meetingparticipants noted that, relative to several months ago, many firms now seemed somewhat moreconfident about the economic outlook. The anticipation of increased sales relative to existing production capacity and also desires to upgrade technology and improve competitiveness wereleading firms to increase spending on equipment and software. Gains in capital spending had beenquite strong last year, and while some of that spending might have been motivated by the year-endexpiration of the partial-expensing provisions of the tax code, participants had seen little evidenceto date that there would be a significant slowdown in the growth of spending in the early part of2005. Low longer-term interest rates on corporate borrowing--reflecting in part narrow credit riskspreads--along with strong corporate profitability and improved balance sheets were continuing tosupport fairly brisk growth of capital expenditures. Low longer-term nominal interest rates werepartly attributable to well-contained inflation expectations, but low real interest rates, along withslight declines in equity prices so far this year, might reflect lingering caution on the part ofbusinesses about the outlook. Nevertheless, narrow credit spreads and risk premiums, along withabundant liquidity in financing markets, suggested that markets now assigned fairly low odds tosignificant downside risks.Solid income gains, low interest rates, and consumer confidence were seen byparticipants as helping to sustain strong growth of household spending. Some firms had reportedthat holiday sales were higher than a year earlier and better than expected, while auto sales hadresponded strongly to incentives in December. The current low measured saving rate seemedmostly explainable by the strength of expected income gains, low interest rates, and the increase inhousehold wealth resulting from the rise in equity and housing prices. Although the saving ratemight well drift up over the next couple of years, participants generally thought it likely thatconsumer spending would continue growing at a strong pace. However, a marked slowing in homeprice appreciation and possible increases in longer-term interest rates, which would raise financingcosts and reduce opportunities to extract equity from homes through refinancings and home equity loans, were seen as downside risks to the prospects for consumption spending and for housingconstruction.Several participants mentioned that the low level of measured national saving, whichimplied a continued need for foreign financing of U.S. investment, and imbalances in the externalsector imparted additional uncertainty to the longer-term economic outlook. The extent to whichthe federal budget deficit would decline over coming years was an open question. As regards thecurrent account balance, some participants noted that the sharp drop in net exports in Novemberprobably reflected transitory factors in large part, as well as reported measurement errors.However, there has been little hard evidence as yet of a strengthening in the growth of spending inour foreign trading partners or of substantial effects on net exports from previous dollar declines.As a result, the external imbalance seemed likely to remain elevated, with a high level ofuncertainty surrounding the prospects for and path of adjustment.A number of participants noted continued modest gains in employment, though somecommented that, based on anecdotal information, job growth seemed to have picked up of late.The increase in aggregate demand was expected to be sufficient over coming quarters to allow therate of unemployment to continue to edge lower even as more people return to the labor force.Participants noted considerable uncertainty about the sustainable rate of resource utilization andabout structural productivity growth. One participant suggested that, given the range ofuncertainty, output might already be at or close to potential. Others commented that recent studiesdid not on balance support a conclusion that structural labor market shifts had caused resourceslack to be lower than commonly estimated and that the flat pattern of growth in wages andcompensation suggested an absence of pressures in labor markets. However, unit labor costs hadaccelerated over 2004 owing to a tapering off in productivity growth. If that slowing reflected a moderation in structural productivity growth and if firms believed that the associated increases inthe growth rate of labor costs were permanent, these cost pressures might be passed through toconsumer prices fairly quickly to preserve profit margins. While participants generally felt that thepace of underlying productivity growth remained robust, careful attention would need to be paid todevelopments regarding unit labor costs and profit margins.Despite some pickup in costs, participants thought that the rate of core inflation likelywould remain low and stable, assuming further removal of policy accommodation. Elevated pricemarkups and profits, as well as slack in resource use, had helped absorb cost increases and putdownward pressure on inflation and would likely continue to do so. Indeed, core inflationmeasures had eased off, both in the latest readings and on balance over the second half of 2004relative to the first half. However, several participants suggested the possibility of an upward skewto the distribution of inflation outcomes, especially if there were appreciable further declines in theforeign exchange value of the dollar or in structural productivity growth; already some participantswere hearing anecdotal reports from firms of an increased ability to pass cost increases through toproduct prices, perhaps because of increasing confidence in the outlook for the economicexpansion.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all of the membersfavored raising the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2-1/2 percent at this meeting.All members judged that a further quarter-point firming in the target federal funds rate wasappropriate in light of current overall accommodative financial conditions and the continuingoutlook for solid economic growth and diminished slack in resource utilization. A higher nominalfederal funds rate was seen as needed to contain risks of increased cost and price pressures, buteven with this action, the real federal funds rate was generally seen as remaining below levels that might reasonably be associated with maintaining a stable inflation rate over the medium run. Thepace of policy moves at upcoming meetings, however, would depend on incoming data.With regard to the Committee\\'s announcement to be released after the meeting, membersconcurred that overall economic prospects were similar to those prevailing at the time of theDecember meeting and that consequently the statement should be altered only to the minor extentrequired to reflect recent economic developments. They concurred that the statement should notethat output appeared to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, that labormarket conditions continued to improve gradually, and that inflation and longer-term inflationexpectations remained well-contained. They also agreed again to characterize the risks tosustainable growth and price stability as balanced. All members agreed that the FOMC statementfor this meeting should again indicate that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace thatwas likely to be measured but that the Committee would respond to changes in economic prospectsas needed to maintain price stability.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct theFederal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in theSystem Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financialconditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth inoutput. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediatefuture seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing thefederal funds rate at an average of around 2-1/2 percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement tobe released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainmentof both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to beroughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, theCommittee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that islikely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes ineconomic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\"Votes for this action: Messrs.

There were no open market         operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period         since the previous meeting. The Manager also reported on developments         in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in         government securities and federal agency obligations during the period         since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified         these transactions.  By unanimous vote, the Committee voted to extend for one year beginning         in mid-December 2005 the reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with         the Bank of Canada and the Banco de Mexico. The arrangement with the Bank         of Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent and that with the         Banco de Mexico in the amount of $3 billion equivalent. Both arrangements         are associated with the Federal Reserve\\'s participation in the North American         Framework Agreement of 1994. The vote to renew the System\\'s participation         in the swap arrangements maturing in December was taken at this meeting         because of the provision that each party must provide six months prior         notice of an intention to terminate its participation. The information received at this meeting suggested that the growth of         economic activity had unexpectedly moderated during the first quarter         from the rapid pace seen during the second half of 2004. Gains in private         payroll employment over the first quarter were similar to the average         for the second half of 2004 but weakened in March, and manufacturing production         rose only a little, on balance, over February and March. Consumers appeared         to have turned somewhat cautious in their spending, likely a reflection         of higher energy prices. Housing starts fell in March after a sustained         stretch of very high readings, but home sales continued at a rapid rate         throughout the quarter. Growth of capital spending, while strong in the         first quarter, was down from the brisk rates of previous quarters. Sharp         increases in energy prices pushed up headline inflation, and core measures         were also somewhat elevated. Labor costs, however, advanced at a moderate         rate. Employment continued to expand in March, although the increase was         less than the strong advance in February. Employment declined in manufacturing,         retail trade, and temporary help services, but most other sectors registered         gains. The average workweek remained at its recent level, and aggregate         hours posted a small gain. The unemployment rate moved down to 5.2 percent         in March. Also suggesting a gradual erosion of slack in labor markets         were surveys indicating that some employers were finding some jobs requiring         special skills harder to fill and that households were experiencing increases         in job availability. Nevertheless, survey measures of expected conditions         in labor markets softened somewhat in the early months of the year, and         the labor market participation rate remained low in March.  Industrial production continued to expand in the first quarter, but         the pace was slower than in the final months of 2004. Gains were restrained         by a decline in manufacturing output, particularly for motor vehicles         and parts, and by a reduction in energy generation at utilities, which         was held down by unseasonably warm weather early in the year. Mining output,         however, accelerated, as did production in the business equipment and         defense and space equipment industries. Capacity utilization in manufacturing         edged up on average in the first quarter, but moved down in March and         remained a bit below its thirty-year average.  Consumer spending advanced solidly in the first quarter despite some         slowing in automobile sales. However, much of that strength was registered         early in the quarter, and spending in March was subdued. Measures of consumer         confidence declined in the early months of the year but remained well         above the lows of two years ago. Other factors underlying consumer spending         also remained favorable: Real wages and salaries continued to rise, and         the ratio of wealth to income remained high, although it was down a bit         because of a decline in equity prices. The personal saving rate stayed         low over the first quarter of the year. Housing starts slowed in March, after exceptional strength in the prior         two months. However, a substantial increase in the level of permits in         March suggested that starts likely turned back up in April. A similar         pattern was observed in the multifamily sector. The thirty-year mortgage         rate in the first quarter stayed in a range around its average level for         the past two years. Sales of existing homes were rapid throughout the         quarter, and sales of new homes rose to another record level in March.         House prices continued to rise rapidly over the first quarter, although         recent data suggested some slowing.  Growth of business spending on equipment and software moderated substantially         in the first quarter from the very high rates of last year, but appeared         to retain considerable momentum; strong gains occurred in all major categories         except motor vehicles. This performance reflected favorable underlying         fundamentals, including solid growth in business output, strong retained         earnings, high levels of liquid assets, and favorable borrowing conditions         in the form of low interest rates and narrow risk spreads in bond and         loan markets. At the same time, construction of nonresidential structures         remained quite subdued. Over the first quarter, outlays for manufacturing         facilities picked up a bit, but those for office buildings stayed low         despite some declines in the office vacancy rate, and spending on commercial         structures fell.  Nonfarm inventories accumulated in the first two months of the year         at a much faster rate than in the preceding quarter, prompting a small         increase in inventory-sales ratios. Inventory gains were especially strong         early in the quarter and were concentrated in the manufacturing sector.        The U.S. international trade deficit widened in February as exports         held steady. The value of imported oil jumped sharply, and nonoil imports         also rose. Economic indicators for major foreign industrial countries         suggested some slowing of growth late in the quarter after a pickup earlier         in the year. In Japan, industrial production rose briskly in January before         falling back; the euro-area industrial sector evidenced a similar pattern.         By contrast, economic activity in China and other developing countries         showed greater buoyancy. Consumer price inflation abroad remained subdued.        U.S. consumer price inflation firmed in recent months as energy prices         rose sharply. Core consumer prices also rose a bit more rapidly recently,         but the increase over the twelve months ending in March was little different         than over the year-earlier period. According to survey information, expectations         of near-term inflation picked up in March, consistent with the increase         in energy prices. As for labor costs, the employment cost index for private         industry decelerated over the first quarter from an already moderate pace.         The slowing occurred in both the wages and salaries component and the         benefits component and was fairly widespread across industry groups.  At its March meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase         the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 2-3/4         percent. In its accompanying statement, the Committee expressed its perception         that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside         risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability         should be kept roughly equal. The Committee also noted that economic output         continued to grow at a solid pace despite the rise in energy prices and         that labor market conditions continued to improve gradually. While pressures         on inflation had picked up in recent months and pricing power was more         evident, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained. In         these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation         could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that         it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill         its obligation to maintain price stability.  The FOMC\\'s decision in March to raise the intended level of the federal         funds rate 25 basis points was fully anticipated by the market, as were         its retention in the accompanying statement of the \"measured pace\" language         and its assessment that the risks to price stability and sustainable economic         growth were balanced. Interest rates, however, rose, reportedly in response         to the statement\\'s references to increased price pressures and to more         evident pricing power as well as to the Committee\\'s conditioning of its         risk assessment on \"appropriate monetary policy action.\" Interest rates         rose further the next day following the release of a larger-than-expected         increase in the CPI for February. Over subsequent weeks, however, these         increases were more than reversed by weaker-than-expected data on consumer         spending, consumer sentiment, and output. Further downward pressure on         interest rates was exerted by the market\\'s response to the release of         the minutes of the March meeting, as attention focused on the reference         to Committee members\\' judgment that an accelerated path of policy tightening         was not necessary at that time. Despite generally good first-quarter earnings         reports, equity indexes moved down considerably in response to the signs         of weaker economic growth. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar rose         on balance, apparently due, in part, to disappointing news on employment         and output abroad. M2 expanded in March and April at about the same sluggish pace as it         did earlier in the year. The growth of M2 continued to be restrained by         increases in its opportunity cost resulting from rising short-term interest         rates. Rates paid on its liquid components particularly lagged increases         in market rates.  Partly in response to the receipt of weaker-than-expected data for spending         and output in the first quarter, the staff marked down somewhat its forecast         of economic growth for 2005 and 2006. Even so, the economy was seen as         retaining considerable momentum, and growth was expected to pick up some         after the first quarter, paced by business spending on equipment and software.         Consumption expenditures were seen as likely to expand at a moderate rate         and residential investment to slow. With exports forecast to expand a         bit more rapidly than imports, the arithmetic net drag on the economy         from trade was expected to lessen. Fiscal policy was expected to provide         a more moderate impetus to growth this year and next, following the substantial         boost estimated for earlier years. Although economic growth was projected         to run a bit above the staff\\'s estimate of the economy\\'s potential, the         unemployment rate was projected to hold around its current level with         improvements in job prospects expected to lure more workers back into         the labor force. Inflation was projected to edge lower over the rest of         the year and into 2006, reflecting the attenuation of the impact of higher         energy prices and the effects of a slowed rate of growth of import prices         and remaining slack in resource markets. In their discussion of current conditions and the economic outlook,         meeting participants observed that incoming data over the intermeeting         period hinted at possible upside risks for inflation and downside risks         for economic growth. Earlier increases in energy prices seemed to be an         important factor contributing to an uptick in core inflation and a slower         pace of economic activity. With energy prices leveling out more recently,         however, and the behavior of compensation suggesting a lack of pressure         in labor markets, underlying inflation appeared to remain contained. The         weakness in spending was widespread and could not be completely dismissed,         but it had appeared only very recently and could be a product of the inherent         noisiness of high-frequency economic data. On balance, economic fundamentals         including low interest rates, robust underlying productivity growth, and         strengthened business balance sheets were expected to support economic         growth at a pace sufficient to gradually eliminate remaining slack in         resource utilization. Although the economic outlook generally seemed favorable,         there was also broad recognition of greater uncertainty attending the         outlook for both inflation and output growth. Capital expenditures advanced briskly over the first quarter, but at         a pace significantly below that registered over the latter half of last         year. To some extent, businesses probably had pulled capital outlays forward         from this year into 2004 to benefit from the partial-expensing tax provision         that expired at year-end, but the unexpected weakness in capital goods         orders for February and March seemed hard to attribute to this factor         alone. In addition, the prolonged period of elevated spot energy prices,         the sense supported by futures markets that these higher prices may persist         for some time, and the heightened uncertainty about energy prices going         forward, together may have left businesses less confident about the future         and wary of longer-term commitments such as expanding plant capacity or         taking on new workers. A less buoyant and less certain economic outlook         seemed apparent in financial markets as well, where equity prices had         fallen and risk spreads had widened. On balance, though, these financial         developments did not appear to signal the onset of a sharp retrenchment         in investors\\' willingness to bear risk, and capital expenditures were         seen as likely to remain quite robust, spurred by strong economic fundamentals         that included elevated profits, opportunities to raise efficiency by utilizing         new technologies, a low cost of capital, and strong corporate balance         sheets. Indeed, a substantial weakening in business investment in an environment         with such favorable fundamentals would be at odds with the historical         record.  Incoming data for the household sector were viewed as mixed. Higher         gasoline prices seemed to be sapping consumer confidence and consumer         spending. The pace of consumption growth had fallen off appreciably toward         the end of the first quarter, and some participants worried about the         potential for continued sluggishness in consumer spending if increasingly         cautious households sought to raise their saving rate rapidly. On balance,         though, strong income growth and low interest rates augured well for household         spending. Although housing starts had dropped of late, home sales and         other indicators of activity in the residential real estate market remained         at very high levels. House price appreciation was expected to moderate         over coming quarters, but a number of local real estate markets were still         regarded as \"hot,\" with signs of possible speculative excesses in some         areas. The deceleration in final sales over the first quarter had been accompanied         by a sizable accumulation of businesses inventories. The available data         suggested that stocks had accumulated in a variety of industries, but         particularly in the motor vehicle sector where the inventory of new autos         had moved appreciably higher. Although difficult to judge, the inventory         buildup was not regarded as likely to have major implications for aggregate         manufacturing beyond some modest production cutbacks in the current quarter. A relatively high proportion of demand had continued to be met by imports.         Some concern was expressed that incoming data suggested weaker growth         in some of our major trading partners, which posed a downside risk to         forecasts for U.S. exports. Moreover, advances in domestic income were         expected to contribute to brisk growth in imports. Looking ahead, the         U.S. economy was expected to continue to run quite substantial current         account deficits, although the impact of past dollar depreciation should         work to boost exports and slow the rise in imports to some extent. Recent energy price developments garnered considerable attention. Declines         in energy prices in recent weeks were viewed as welcome, but participants         noted that far-dated futures prices for oil remained quite elevated and         that persistently high energy prices could trigger a range of deleterious         effects on the economy. High energy prices appeared to be taking a toll         on household and business confidence and might be beginning to crimp corporate         profits. In some cases, firms seemed to be more successfully passing on         energy costs to their customers. Indeed, some portion of recent elevated         inflation readings probably represented, at least partly, such pass-through         effects from higher energy costs. However, while pass-through effects         could leave the overall price level higher, their impact on inflation         should fade over time, as long as inflation expectations remain well contained.         Still, considerable uncertainty surrounded the degree of pass-through         from energy prices to core consumer prices, and pass-through effects might         be more pronounced when energy price increases were perceived as more         likely to be permanent. Persistently high energy prices were mentioned         as a factor that could trim the level of potential output to a small degree         over time, possibly contributing to additional upward pressure on consumer         prices at the margin. Participants voiced concerns about recent price trends; they expected         inflation to remain contained but also perceived that the risks to that         inflation outlook now might be skewed somewhat to the upside. Core measures         of price inflation had moved up over recent quarters and particularly         so over the last few months. A discernable upcreep was apparent in survey         measures of short- and, to a limited extent, long-term inflation expectations         over recent months. Moreover, there were risks that the relative stability         of long-term survey measures of inflation expectations could simply reflect         lags in households\\' perceptions of changing economic prospects. The success         that some businesses seemed to be encountering in passing through cost         increases raised the possibility that competitive pressures and resource         slack were exerting somewhat less restraint on inflation than had been         anticipated. However, available indicators of wages and benefits had registered only         modest growth, suggesting to many that some slack in labor markets persisted.         Moreover, market measures of inflation compensation had ebbed in recent         weeks, and survey measures of long-term inflation expectations, albeit         a touch higher of late, remained in the broad range of recent years. Along         with energy prices, import and materials prices apparently had contributed         to the recent uptick in inflation, and pressures on inflation stemming         from these three sources were expected to lessen over coming quarters.         On balance, measures of core inflation were thought likely to remain in         check over the remainder of this year and next. In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting         period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis         points to 3 percent at this meeting. Although downside risks to sustainable         growth had become more evident, most members regarded the recent slower         growth of economic activity as likely to be transitory. In this regard,         the ability of the U.S. economy to withstand significant shocks over recent         years buttressed the view that policymakers should not overreact to a         comparatively small number of disappointing indicators, especially when         economic fundamentals appeared to remain quite supportive of continued         solid expansion. To be sure, the Committee had raised its federal funds         rate target appreciably over the past year, and, in the view of a few         members, a larger-than-expected moderation of aggregate demand in response         to this cumulative policy action could not be ruled out. However, all         members regarded the stance of policy as accommodative and judged that         the current level of short-term rates remained too low to be consistent         with sustainable growth and stable prices in the long run. Against the         backdrop of the recent uptick in core inflation and in some measures of         inflation expectations, members agreed that they should continue along         the course of removing policy accommodation at a measured pace conditional         on the outlook for inflation and economic growth.  In discussing the statement to be released after the meeting, members         agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge that rising energy prices         seemed to have spurred an increase in core measures of inflation by dropping         the reference from the March statement indicating that \"The rise in energy         prices, however, has not notably fed through to core consumer prices.\"         They likewise all agreed that mention should be made that, on balance,         longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained. Regarding         the risks to sustainable growth and price stability, some members noted         that the risk assessment conditioned on \"appropriate policy\" no longer         seemed to convey useful information regarding the Committee\\'s economic         and policy outlook. Although some members noted that a case could be made         that the risks to inflation were now somewhat skewed to the upside and         those to sustainable economic growth perhaps to the downside, the most         likely outcome remained one of stable prices and sustainable growth, and         the Committee agreed that it should retain a balanced assessment of risks         conditional on appropriate policy.  For many, heightened economic uncertainty in the current environment         implied greater uncertainty about the range of possible policy outcomes         and placed a premium on flexibility in setting policy at upcoming meetings.         Some members commented that this greater uncertainty called for eliminating         or paring back forward-looking language from the statement--if not at         this meeting, then fairly soon. In the event, most members viewed the         forward-looking language in the statement--including the characterization         of the stance of policy as accommodative as well as the judgment that         policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that is \"likely to be         measured\"--as a reasonable characterization of the policy stance and its         likely evolution over time. Moreover, a number remarked that the language         in its current form was clearly conditioned on economic developments and         therefore would not stand in the way of either a pause or a step-up in         policy firming depending on events. In the end, all members agreed to         retain the forward-looking language.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize         and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed         otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance         with the following domestic policy directive: \"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial           conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable           growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee           in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent           with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 3 percent.\"               The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the       statement to be released shortly after the meeting:  \"The         Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the         upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth         and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation         expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation         can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the         Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill         its obligation to maintain price stability.\" Votes for this action: Messrs.

Freeman to serve as associate economist of         the Committee until the selection of a successor at the first regularly         scheduled meeting after December 31, 2005. The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments         in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign         currencies for the        System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting. The Manager         also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System         open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations         during the period since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee         ratified these transactions. At this meeting the Committee reviewed and discussed staff presentations         on the topic of housing valuations and monetary policy. Prices of houses         in the United States had risen sharply in recent years, especially in         certain areas of the country, to very high levels relative to incomes         or rents. In addition to local market factors, a wide range of influences         appeared to be supporting home prices, including solid gains in disposable         income, low mortgage rates, and financial innovation in the residential         mortgage market. Prices might be somewhat above the levels consistent         with these underlying factors, but measuring the extent of any overvaluation         either nationally or in regional markets posed considerable conceptual         and statistical difficulties. Meeting participants noted that the rise         in house prices had been accompanied by a modest shift toward potentially         riskier types of mortgages, including adjustable-rate and interest-only         loans, which could pose challenges to both lenders and borrowers. Nonetheless,         financial institutions generally remained in a comfortable capital position,         such loans had performed well thus far, much of the associated risk had         been transferred to other investors through securitization, and valuations         had risen more rapidly than mortgage debt on average--so that loan-to-value         ratios had fallen.  The information received at this meeting suggested that the economy         was expanding at a moderate pace in the second quarter. Housing activity         remained at a high level, business investment appeared to have improved         some after a slowdown of growth in the first quarter, and manufacturing         picked up notably in May. Supported by a rebound in motor vehicle purchases,         consumer spending appeared on track to post another moderate gain for         the quarter. Labor demand continued to expand, and the unemployment rate         edged down further in May. Core CPI inflation slowed in April and May,         but crude oil prices turned higher again following a decline earlier in         the spring.  Averaging through a large gain in April and a more modest increase in         May, growth in payroll employment was on par with that over the preceding         six months. Payrolls expanded in line with their recent trends in the         construction, transportation and utilities, and nonbusiness services sectors,         while hiring in financial services slowed a bit, and the manufacturing         sector posted further small losses of jobs. The average workweek of production         or nonsupervisory workers edged up over the two-month period, helping         to boost aggregate hours to the highest level since early 2001. The unemployment         rate dipped to 5.1 percent in May. Meanwhile, the labor force participation         rate moved up a bit, suggesting that the labor market had strengthened         enough to attract some individuals back into the workforce. Survey indicators         and the continued relatively low level of initial claims for unemployment         insurance also supported the notion of continued improvement in the labor         market. Industrial production declined in April, owing to a dip in utilities         output, but widespread gains in manufacturing output in May offset that         loss. On net, industrial production was little changed over April and         May; capacity utilization generally followed the same pattern as output. Real personal consumption expenditures appeared to be increasing at         a moderate pace this quarter, though a bit below that of the first quarter.         Purchases of motor vehicles rebounded smartly after declining in the first         quarter. Excluding motor vehicles, however, the expansion of real consumer         outlays likely slowed of late, against a backdrop of modest gains in real         income. Recent measures of consumer confidence improved from their levels         earlier in the spring, when higher gasoline prices and concerns about         a slowing in the pace of the economic expansion may have served as restraining         influences. Activity in the housing sector remained robust. Single-family starts         averaged more than 1.65 million units at an annual rate in April and May,         not much below the very strong first-quarter pace. Sales of both new and         existing homes remained at a high level in May. While prices of existing         homes continued to increase rapidly, new home prices showed signs of decelerating.         Available indicators suggested that, with the ongoing support of low mortgage         rates, the housing sector remained strong in June.  Spending on equipment and software registered a solid increase in the         first quarter, and the available data suggested that second-quarter spending         was continuing at a slightly faster pace. Shipments of nondefense capital         goods posted sizable increases in recent months, although gains in orders         were more uneven. Broadly speaking, the fundamentals continued to support         business investment, with the user cost of capital still low and corporate         balance sheets healthy. Outlays for construction of nonresidential structures         appeared to have picked up some, but the level of such investment remained         subdued. And although spending on commercial structures had moved up in         recent months, outlays for office buildings were still at depressed levels,         and expenditures on manufacturing and other facilities were lackluster. The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories continued to grow         in April, but more slowly than in the first quarter. With these increases,         the inventory-sales ratio fell back in April after moving up a little         in the first quarter. After reaching a record high relative to GDP in February, the U.S. international         trade deficit narrowed in March, but widened again in April. While the         value of exports of goods and services increased in both months, the value         of imports of goods and services jumped in April, more than offsetting         a decline in March. GDP growth in most major foreign industrial economies         picked up slightly in the first quarter, but recent economic indicators         for the major foreign economies in the second quarter were mixed. Consumer prices were about unchanged in May after posting large increases         in the previous few months. Consumer energy prices, in particular, reversed         part of their earlier run-up. Excluding food and energy, inflation appeared         to have moderated slightly from its pace in the early part of the year.         Despite this moderation, measures of core consumer price inflation over         the past year were somewhat above those for the comparable period a year         ago. The producer price index rose sharply in April, but dropped back         again in May, driven largely by a swing in the food and energy components.         According to recent surveys, both near-term and longer-term inflation         expectations had changed little over the past two months, and market measures         of inflation compensation had moved lower. With regard to labor costs,         growth in hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector in the first         quarter was estimated to have slowed some after advancing notably in the         fourth quarter; the first quarter increase was broadly similar to those         posted during the middle of last year.  At its May meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase         the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 3 percent.         In its accompanying statement, the Committee expressed its perception         that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside         risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability         should be kept roughly equal. The Committee also noted that recent data         suggested that the solid pace of spending growth had slowed somewhat,         partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices, but that         labor market conditions apparently continued to improve gradually. While         pressures on inflation had picked up in recent months and pricing power         was more evident, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained.         In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation         could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that         it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill         its obligation to maintain price stability. The decision at the May FOMC meeting to raise the federal funds rate         target 25 basis points, to 3 percent, to maintain an assessment that risks         to the goals of price stability and sustained growth were balanced, and         to retain the \"measured pace\" language was widely expected in financial         markets. The publication of the minutes three weeks later also contained         few surprises for investors and elicited little market reaction. Market         expectations for the future path of policy ended the period higher in         the near term but lower at longer horizons. Nominal Treasury yields followed         the shift in policy expectations, with near-term yields higher and longer-term         yields modestly lower, on net. Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds         were little changed over the intermeeting period, but spreads on speculative-grade         bonds contracted notably. Buoyed by the drop in longer-term interest rates         and largely upbeat economic news, major equity indexes rose appreciably         over the intermeeting period. The positive economic data also seemed to         lift the dollar against major foreign currencies, though the dollar\\'s         moves against individual currencies varied widely. M2 edged lower over April and May as the opportunity cost of holding         M2 assets rose further. Liquid deposits were especially weak, owing to         the slow adjustment of yields paid on these deposits to increases in market         rates. Despite the recent softness in M2, its velocity remained quite         low relative to its historical relationships with opportunity cost. Bank         credit decelerated sharply in April and May from rapid gains posted in         the first quarter, as growth in both securities and loans fell. In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen         as likely to expand this year and next at a rate just above its potential.         The effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected         to be counterbalanced by continued low long-term interest rates and an         abatement of energy-related headwinds. Household spending was expected         to firm going forward as real income posts solid gains attributable in         part to the ongoing improvement in the labor market. Business investment         was projected to benefit from the combination of favorable prospects for         sales, supportive financial markets, and the ongoing need to replace or         upgrade aging equipment and software. A slightly larger portion of domestic         demand was expected to be supplied by imports over the forecast period.         The forecast for consumer price inflation was revised up, with inflation         seen as somewhat higher this year than in 2004, reflecting in part higher         import prices and the direct and indirect effects of higher energy prices,         and only edging lower next year as these price pressures wane. In their discussion of current conditions and the economic outlook,         many meeting participants noted that incoming data had been reassuring         about the strength of the expansion. Following some softer readings earlier         in the year, incoming spending and production data over the intermeeting         period indicated that the expansion remained firm, led by residential         and business investment. In addition, labor market conditions continued         to strengthen gradually. The economy evidently had been resilient in the         face of rising energy prices, and financial conditions remained accommodative,         supporting growth going forward. Increases in core consumer prices had         slowed of late, though underlying inflation was still seen by most meeting         participants as likely to be modestly higher this year than last, impelled         in part by the pass-through of a further rise in energy prices. However,         the impetus to inflation from the prices of oil and other commodities         was expected to wane, and long-term inflation expectations apparently         remained well-anchored. With some limited remaining slack in labor markets         likely damping growth in compensation, as well as further withdrawal of         policy accommodation, core inflation was expected to remain contained. In preparation for the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual report to the Congress         on monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents         of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth         of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for         2005 and 2006. The forecasts of the rate of expansion in real GDP were         concentrated in the upper part of a 3 to 3-3/4 percent range for 2005,         and the forecasts for 2006 were concentrated at the lower end of a range         of 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 percent. These rates of growth were associated         with a civilian unemployment rate of 5 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth         quarter of this year and a rate of 5 percent in the fourth quarter of         2006. Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE         price index, were mainly near the middle of a 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 percent         range this year and somewhat below the middle of a range of 1-1/2         to 2-1/2 percent next year.  In their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy,         meeting participants noted that the fundamentals underlying household         spending remained firm. With rising home and equity prices buoying household         wealth, consumer expenditures continued to advance. Although the recent         surge in energy prices was anticipated to impose some drag for a time,         consumption spending was expected to grow about in line with income going         forward, in an environment of further gradual improvements in labor markets.         Increased speculative activity in housing markets was evident in some         parts of the country, but robust demand for new homes owed in large part         to the ongoing economic expansion and low long-term interest rates. Business outlays for capital goods continued to rise, and the outlook         for investment spending remained solid, supported by increased sales,         low interest rates, robust profits, and strong business balance sheets.         Anecdotal reports from industry contacts generally pointed to planned         increases in investment spending, though in some regions businesses apparently         remained cautious about the outlook. Conditions in the commercial real         estate sector, which had been weak for some time, were said to have improved         in some parts of the nation.  Several meeting participants expressed some concern about domestic and         global imbalances. Large federal budget deficits were expected to persist         despite an increase in tax receipts in recent months. These deficits were         contributing to a low level of national saving that would, if not corrected         over time, ultimately constrain investment and overall economic growth.         Moreover, U.S. trade deficits were expected to remain large going forward,         reflecting both the low level of U.S. saving and relatively slow growth         in some of our trading partners. Uncertainties regarding the nature and         timing of the potential correction of these imbalances complicated the         assessment of the intermediate-term prospects for the U.S. economy. In their discussion of developments in asset markets, the participants\\'         comments focused on two related issues: the low level of long-term interest         rates and the continued run-up in home prices. Despite substantial cumulative         policy tightening over the past year, long-term Treasury yields had moved         considerably lower, implying a significant flattening of the yield curve         (measured as the spread between long-term and short-term Treasury yields).         Lower compensation for inflation accounted for a portion of the decline         in longer-term nominal yields, but a larger portion reflected reductions         in real yields. Participants cited a variety of factors as possibly contributing         to the unusual behavior of long-term rates over this period. For one,         investors might have marked down the level of real interest rates seen         as likely to be necessary to contain inflation and keep output in line         with potential--perhaps reflecting weak investment demand abroad relative         to saving--or even might have come to expect a stretch of sub-par U.S.         growth. However, anticipation of slow growth seemed inconsistent with         higher stock prices and thin risk spreads in corporate debt markets. The         behavior of long-term interest rates could also reflect reduced uncertainty         on the part of investors about the economic outlook -- as seen in low         readings of implied volatility in bond and equity markets. Finally, demands         for longer-term U.S. securities by both domestic and foreign investors         might have been boosted by special factors. Confidence about the economic         outlook and low market interest rates--along with possibly outsized expectations         of capital gains in some markets--could also help to account for the high         level of home prices the Committee had discussed on the first day of the         meeting. It was agreed that considerable uncertainty attended the outlook         for both long-term interest rates and home prices. With regard to any role for monetary policy in responding to possible         imbalances in housing or bond markets, meeting participants stressed the         importance of the pursuit of their core objectives of price stability         and maximum sustainable economic growth. To the extent that an asset price         movement threatened the achievement of those objectives, it would of course         be taken into consideration in setting policy. However, given the unavoidable         uncertainties associated with judgments regarding the appropriate level         of and likely future movements in asset prices, a strategy of responding         more directly to possible mispricing was seen as very unlikely to contribute,         on balance, to the achievement of the Committee\\'s objectives over time.        Participants\\' views on the inflation outlook were mixed. Thus far in         2005, core consumer price inflation had been higher than most participants         had expected at the start of the year, reflecting, at least in part, the         pass-through effects of higher energy, commodity, and import prices. While         such shocks could be expected to boost inflation temporarily, some participants         expressed concern that, with policy still accommodative, the underlying         pace of inflation might be in the process of stepping up, perhaps to a         level that was at the upper end of the range that they viewed as compatible         with the Committee\\'s price stability objective. The degree of slack remaining         in labor and resource markets was very uncertain, and unit labor costs         in the nonfarm business sector had moved notably higher in recent quarters.         Trend unit labor costs could also be boosted by slower growth in structural         productivity; while recent evidence was not conclusive, some participants         thought the underlying pace of productivity growth might well fall back         in coming quarters following the substantial gains seen in recent years.         And with higher energy prices already eating into profit margins at firms         outside the energy sector, increases in unit labor costs might be more         likely to be passed through into prices.  While agreeing that inflation developments had to be watched carefully,         other meeting participants emphasized that recent core inflation data         had been relatively restrained, and anecdotal reports suggested that pricing         power at many firms remained quite limited. Moreover, readings from futures         markets suggested that oil prices would likely flatten out, so their effect         on inflation should gradually ebb. Similarly, prices of other commodities         and imports, which had surged for a time, were now moderating. Survey         and market measures of long-term inflation expectations did not suggest         that the earlier higher inflation readings were going to persist. Finally,         while the degree of slack in labor markets was uncertain, total labor         compensation had probably been boosted temporarily around the turn of         the year by special factors, and the recent behavior of a range of other         indicators of labor costs appeared consistent with some remaining slack         that would likely tend to restrain inflation pressures. Moreover, anecdotal         reports of labor market conditions continued to point to shortages of         labor only for certain, mostly skilled, occupations.  In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, all         members agreed on a 25 basis point increase in the target federal funds         rate to 3-1/4 percent. Economic growth remained firm, while rising         energy, and possibly labor, costs threatened to put upward pressure on         inflation. Even with this action, the federal funds rate remained below         the level members anticipated would prove necessary in the long run to         contain inflation pressures and keep output near potential. However, the         pace and extent of future policy moves would depend on incoming data.        In considering the statement to be released following this meeting,         members concurred that it should note that even with the rise in oil prices,         the expansion remained firm and labor markets continued to improve gradually.         All also thought that the statement should note the continued pressures         on inflation, while mentioning that long-term inflation expectations remained         well contained. With policy still seen as accommodative, members agreed         that the statement should retain an assessment that the risks to both         sustainable economic growth and price stability were balanced, conditional         on appropriate policy action. Members also agreed that the statement language         indicating that \"policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is         likely to be measured\" correctly characterized the outlook for policy         for now. The members concurred that at this stage in the expansion, with         margins of slack resources narrowing and inflation somewhat higher, the         Committee needed to be particularly alert to signs of a further increase         in inflation. Such an increase could be particularly problematic because         it might impart upward momentum to inflation expectations that would be         costly to reverse. In any case, additional tightening would probably be         necessary, but views differed on the amount of tightening that would likely         be required to keep inflation contained and bring output in line with         potential. However, members agreed that there was no need to make such         an assessment at this time, and that the appropriate pace and degree of         cumulative policy adjustment would depend on economic developments going         forward. With the forward-looking language in the statement clearly conditioned         on the outlook, it was not seen as limiting the Committee\\'s flexibility         in responding to such developments.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize         and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed         otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance         with the following domestic policy directive:  \"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions           that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.           To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future           seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal           funds rate to an average of around 3-1/4 percent.\"       The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the       statement       to be released shortly after the meeting: \"The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy         action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable         growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying         inflation expected to be contained, the         Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace         that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond         to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to         maintain price stability.\" Votes for this action: Messrs.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information received at this meeting suggested that final demand had expanded at a solid pace in the second quarter, led by a surge in net exports and another robust gain in residential investment, while business investment and consumer spending rose at moderate rates.  The labor market continued to improve gradually in June and July.  Core CPI and PCE prices decelerated in recent months, after notable increases earlier in the year.  Crude oil prices continued to rise, reaching record levels in nominal terms over the intermeeting period. Payroll employment grew in June and July at a pace that was roughly on par with that over the preceding six months.  Hiring in the services and construction sectors remained strong, but the manufacturing sector posted further small job losses.  With employment increasing and the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers unchanged over these two months, aggregate hours continued to firm.  The unemployment rate dipped to 5.0 percent in June and held steady at that rate in July.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance remained at low levels.    \\tIndustrial production picked up in June.  A jump in utilities output, apparently owing to unseasonably warm weather, accounted for more than half of the gain.  Motor vehicle production also rose a good bit, but the pace of production growth in the high-tech sector was sluggish, reflecting a decline in the output of communications equipment.  Overall capacity utilization moved up to its highest level since December 2000.Real personal consumption expenditures increased at a moderate pace in the second quarter, buoyed by a surge in purchases of motor vehicles that appeared to be due largely to the extension by an automaker of its \"employee discount\" program to the general public.  Excluding spending on motor vehicles, the growth of real personal consumption expenditures slowed slightly in the second quarter.  Survey measures of consumer confidence continued to be quite favorable in July.  Activity in the housing sector remained robust.  In June, starts of single-family homes maintained the strong pace of earlier this year.  Both new and existing home sales jumped.  Mortgage rates remained low, and house prices apparently continued to rise briskly.  Business spending on equipment and software posted a solid increase in the second quarter, boosted by a surge in outlays for transportation equipment.  Excluding this volatile component, business spending on equipment and software decelerated markedly in the second quarter.  Spending on nonresidential construction remained subdued.  Nonetheless, fundamentals appeared to continue to support business investment, with the user cost of capital still low and corporations experiencing strong cash flows and holding ample liquid assets.Real nonfarm inventories edged down in the second quarter, after a substantial rise in the first quarter.  The strong pace of motor vehicle sales contributed to the runoff of inventories in the second quarter.  Outside the automobile sector, real nonfarm inventories continued to rise, but at a much slower pace than earlier in the year.  The inventory-sales ratio for the nonfarm business sector declined further from an already low level, continuing its long-term downward trend.The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in May as the value of exports of goods and services rose slightly and the value of imports declined, partly reflecting a sharp drop in the value of oil imports.  GDP growth in a number of major foreign industrial economies appeared to have slowed a bit in the second quarter.Consumer prices were about unchanged in June after posting notable increases earlier in the year.  Consumer energy prices reversed a small part of their previous run-up, and core consumer inflation remained low.  The producer price index was unchanged in June.  The annual revisions to the national income and product accounts, which were released in early August, included a substantial upward revision to core PCE inflation for 2004, from 1.6 percent to 2.2 percent, reflecting changes to the nonmarket-based components of the index.  Survey measures of near-term inflation expectations edged down in July, and longer-term inflation expectations firmed only a touch.  The employment cost index for private industry workers again rose at a modest pace in the second quarter, and increases in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector slowed somewhat from the rapid rate of the first quarter. At its June meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 3¼ percent.  In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  In addition, the Committee noted that the expansion remained firm, that labor market conditions continued to improve gradually, and that, although pressures on inflation had remained elevated, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained.  In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.  The Committee\\'s decision at its June meeting to raise the intended level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to maintain an assessment that risks to the goals of price stability and sustained growth were balanced assuming appropriate monetary policy action, and to retain the \"measured pace\" language was widely expected in financial markets.  Over the intermeeting period, however, investors appreciably marked up their expectations for the path of policy, primarily in response to incoming economic data suggesting more strength in spending and output than had been anticipated.  Nominal Treasury yields increased in line with the revision to policy expectations.  Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose a touch less than their nominal counterparts, leaving inflation compensation only slightly higher.  Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were little changed over the intermeeting period, but those on speculative-grade bonds declined markedly, ending the period close to the very low levels reached earlier this year.  Major equity indexes advanced, supported by strong corporate earnings reports.  The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.  The People\\'s Bank of China announced a change to its exchange-rate regime, including an immediate 2.1 percent appreciation of the renminbi versus the dollar.M2 continued to grow sluggishly on balance over June and July.  Small time deposits, whose rates of return adjust relatively quickly to changes in market rates, expanded briskly.  However, liquid deposits and retail money market mutual funds were little changed on net over these two months.  Despite the recent slow growth of M2, its velocity remained low relative to the level that would be expected based on its historical relationship with opportunity cost.  The growth of bank credit was restrained in June by a runoff in securities holdings but picked up in July. In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff raised its projection for economic growth over the remainder of 2005 in light of incoming data suggesting greater near-term momentum in aggregate demand.  At the same time, however, it trimmed the growth rate forecast for 2006, reflecting the effects of higher energy prices, higher long-term interest rates, and the somewhat slower growth of productive capacity implied by the annual revisions to the national accounts.  The output gap was predicted to be essentially closed by the end of this year.  Inventory investment was projected to resume contributing to GDP growth over the second half of this year, after the sharp swing toward inventory runoffs in the second quarter.  Growth in consumer spending was expected to firm in the third quarter, buoyed by motor vehicle spending, before falling back in the fourth quarter.  With housing starts essentially flat, residential investment was projected to decelerate substantially over the remainder of this year.  Business investment was predicted to continue to rise at a moderate pace, benefiting from still-accommodative financial conditions and the ongoing need to replace depreciating equipment and software.  The recent improvement in the trade balance was expected to be transitory.  Notwithstanding recent benign readings on inflation, the forecast for core PCE inflation was raised somewhat, owing in part to the recent further rise in energy prices and, in light of the revisions to historical data, a higher assumed trajectory for the nonmarket component of core PCE prices.In their discussion of current conditions and the economic outlook, meeting participants noted that aggregate spending appeared to have picked up in recent months by more than anticipated and that current estimates of slack were narrower than those reviewed at the June meeting.  In addition, high and rising energy prices were adding to pressures on overall inflation, and energy price increases probably would feed through, at least temporarily, to core measures of inflation.  Nonetheless, core inflation recently had been relatively low and inflation expectations remained well contained.  Moreover, participants thought that some slowing in final sales was likely later this year as net exports resumed their decline and purchases of automobiles fell back with the expiration of special discount programs.  In these circumstances, it appeared that, for now, continued removal of policy accommodation at a measured pace still would likely be sufficient to keep inflation contained, but participants also recognized that the pace and cumulative extent of policy adjustment going forward would depend importantly on economic developments.  In the household sector, the path for spending was expected to be bolstered in the near term by still-low interest rates, solid growth in disposable income, and ongoing increases in wealth.  However, elevated energy prices were seen as likely to be a significant drag on consumption and, on net, household spending was expected to advance at a moderate pace.  Housing sales and construction activity generally remained strong across the country, but meeting participants noted anecdotal evidence of some cooling in housing markets in certain areas.  And at least some banks were reportedly beginning to apply somewhat tighter standards in real estate lending and becoming more cautious in their promotion of nontraditional mortgage products.  Participants generally anticipated that the pace of home price appreciation would slow over time, though the timing and extent of that slowing, as well as its implications for consumer spending, were quite uncertain.Participants indicated that business investment had been evolving roughly in line with their expectations.  Strong fundamentals, including low interest rates, wide profit margins, and a high level of liquid assets, were seen as supporting expenditures on software and equipment going forward.  Inventory investment declined in the second quarter, with much of the falloff concentrated in the motor vehicle industry, where sales had been boosted sharply by the introduction of special discount programs.  Inventories now seemed to be coming in line with the trend in final demand and were anticipated to expand along with sales later this year.Participants viewed the increases in market interest rates over the intermeeting period as an appropriate response to the stronger economic outlook.  A few participants voiced concerns that still-low interest rates and insufficient recognition by investors of the dependency of the Committee\\'s policy expectations on economic data were continuing to foster an inappropriate degree of risk-taking in financial markets.  Another participant mentioned, however, that recent sluggish growth of the monetary aggregates suggested that the stance of policy was not overly accommodative.  Moreover, with a higher proportion of mortgages now tied to short-term rates, it was noted that increases in short-term rates could have a somewhat larger-than-usual effect on spending.  On balance, current financial conditions, which embedded expectations of future policy tightening, were generally seen as likely to be consistent with sustained moderate economic growth and containment of pressures on inflation in coming quarters.Regarding the federal budget, a recent narrowing of the deficit was noted, but the improvement appeared to be attributable to cyclical factors and to increases in the level of tax collections that were not likely to be repeated.  Few signs were evident that greater fiscal discipline in the budget process would emerge any time soon.  As a result, federal deficits were expected to continue to act as a considerable drain on national saving over the longer run.  Although net exports had been significantly higher over the second quarter than had been expected, participants did not see this development as signaling the beginning of a sustained improvement in the trade and current account balances.  The strong advance in exports and weakness in imports in the second quarter seemed largely attributable to special factors.  Continued brisk import growth appeared likely to be sustained for the foreseeable future by gains in domestic demand. Participants discussed at length the factors affecting costs and prices.  Although uncertainties about the underlying pace of productivity increases, trends in labor force participation, and the level of potential output complicated the inflation outlook, higher energy prices and reduced resource slack were seen as pointing to elevated inflation pressures.  While recent monthly readings indicated that core inflation had been subdued, a number of participants noted that underlying core inflation appeared to be running at a pace around the upper end of the range they viewed as consistent with price stability-an assessment that was reinforced by the recent upward revisions to historical data on core PCE inflation.  Participants commented that an increase in inflation from recent rates could have especially adverse effects on longer-run economic performance.  While most participants viewed the risks to inflation as having ticked up over the intermeeting period, many also cited factors that, in concert with the likely continued removal of policy accommodation, would tend to hold inflation pressures in check.  For example, few indications had emerged recently that businesses had enjoyed any significant increase in pricing power, and the continuing expansion of global trade was seen as an important factor limiting firms\\' ability to pass through cost increases.  In these circumstances and with markups at relatively high levels, a substantial proportion of any increases in business costs might well be reflected in narrower profit margins.  Moreover, the recent relatively low monthly readings on core inflation and modest wage pressures, at least by some measures, suggested that some slack remained in resource utilization.  Despite the rise in oil prices and quickening pace of economic activity, both market- and survey-based measures of inflation expectations seemed to remain quite well anchored.In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all of the members favored raising the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3½ percent at this meeting.  Even with this action, the federal funds rate would remain below the level that members anticipated would prove necessary to contain inflation pressures and keep output near potential, and thus in all likelihood further policy action would be required.  However, the pace of future policy moves, although likely to be measured, as well as the extent of those moves, would depend on incoming data. In discussing the statement to be released after the meeting, members agreed that it was appropriate to highlight the apparent strengthening in aggregate spending.  Policymakers exchanged views on the characterization of labor market conditions in light of recent employment reports and other indicators, but members ultimately concurred that the description of labor markets as \"improving gradually\" remained appropriate.  Members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge the recent relatively low monthly rates of core inflation, but also to emphasize that inflation pressures remained elevated.  As in past meetings, there was some discussion about the desirability of including forward-looking language in the statement, but members agreed to retain the forward-looking language for now.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 3½ percent.\"  The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that, before the landfall of Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast, expansion of economic activity had been solid, led by robust gains in housing and buoyant consumer spending.  While business investment appeared to be losing some momentum, labor markets continued to improve, and increases in core CPI and PCE prices were modest after notable increases earlier in the year.  Only limited data bearing on the likely economic effects of the hurricane were available.  Oil and gasoline prices, however, were on the rise, spiking to record levels in the days immediately following the hurricane. Payroll employment grew at a good pace in August, and the average increase over the most recent three months was largely on par with the advances made since the fourth quarter of last year.  Employment gains were widespread across industries, with the exception of the manufacturing sector, which continued to post small job losses.  With employment increasing and the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers unchanged in August, aggregate hours continued to firm modestly.  The unemployment rate dipped to 4.9 percent in August, its lowest level since August 2001.  Given the increase in the labor-force participation rate reported for the month, the employment-population ratio rose to its highest level in three years.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance jumped in the latest available week, however, as workers in the Gulf Coast region began to file claims. Industrial production increased only slightly in August; the staff estimated that the curtailment of activity as a result of Hurricane Katrina shaved 0.3 percent from the index.  Petroleum refining and crude oil and natural gas extraction were especially hard hit by the storm.  The output of utilities declined in August after surging earlier in the summer in response to unseasonably warm weather.  Higher production of motor vehicles and parts boosted manufacturing output.  After slowing in the second quarter, the pace of production in the high-tech sector accelerated somewhat in recent months, owing to increased output of communications equipment and semiconductors.  Overall capacity utilization through August remained close to its highest level since December 2000.  Real personal consumption expenditures, boosted by motor vehicles purchases in response to employee-discount programs, were robust during the summer.  Spending on goods outside the automobile sector and on services was moderate.  Strong overall spending along with lackluster real income growth put downward pressure on the saving rate.  Survey measures of consumer confidence early in August were generally consistent with solid increases in spending, but confidence fell appreciably in the period immediately after the storm. Activity in the housing sector remained brisk.  Starts of new single-family homes in July were slightly above their average level for the first half of the year.  New home sales advanced further in July, and existing home sales stayed elevated.  Mortgage rates remained low and supported demand.  Prices of existing homes again rose briskly, while price appreciation for new homes moderated somewhat. Although real outlays for equipment and software increased solidly in the second quarter, available data on orders and shipments suggested some softness in the third quarter.  Amid continued rapid expansion in business output, favorable financing conditions, and ample cash balances, the fundamentals stayed positive.  Real spending on nonresidential construction remained lackluster despite incremental improvements in nonresidential property market conditions this year.Investment in real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles slowed markedly in the second quarter, and partial data for July suggested that real stockbuilding continued to be subdued.  The slower rate of inventory accumulation suggested that firms had largely completed the stockbuilding that had been prompted by earlier low ratios of inventories to sales. The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed somewhat in July, as the value of exports of goods and services rose slightly and the value of imports declined.  The value of oil imports increased strongly in July but that rise was offset by decreases in imports of services and of non-oil goods.  GDP growth in foreign industrial economies picked up, on balance, in the second quarter, but performance across economies was mixed.Core consumer price inflation remained benign in July and August.  However, the surge in energy prices considerably boosted overall consumer price inflation over those months.  Gasoline prices in particular rose steeply in August, and survey data pointed to a larger increase in early September.  Producer price inflation was subdued.  One survey of households in early September indicated that near-term inflation expectations jumped and that longer-term inflation expectations edged higher.  With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index for private industry workers rose at a modest pace in the second quarter, and the twelve-month change in this index declined from that of a year earlier.  Average hourly earnings rose only moderately over the past twelve months. At its August meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 3-1/2 percent.  In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  In addition, the Committee noted that, despite high energy prices, aggregate spending appeared to have strengthened, labor market conditions continued to improve gradually, and longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained, although pressures on inflation had stayed elevated.  In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. The Committee\\'s decision at its August meeting was widely expected in financial markets and evoked little price reaction.  Over the intermeeting period, however, investors marked down their expectations for the path of policy, partly in response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina.  Nominal Treasury yields decreased about in line with the revision to policy expectations.  Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities fell a bit more than their nominal counterparts, leaving inflation compensation slightly higher.  Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were little changed over the intermeeting period, but those on speculative-grade bonds increased from very low levels.  Major equity indexes appeared to be supported by lower interest rates and posted modest gains despite the increases in energy prices.  The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated slightly over the intermeeting period. M2 grew moderately, on balance, in August.  Liquid deposits edged higher, but retail money market mutual funds contracted, on net.  Small time deposits, whose rates of return adjust relatively quickly to changes in market rates, continued to expand rapidly.  The growth of bank credit surged, as loans expanded briskly.In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff lowered its projection for economic growth over the remainder of 2005 in light of the economic dislocation associated with Hurricane Katrina.  At the same time, however, the staff increased the growth rate forecast for 2006 to reflect the boost to economic activity from the rebuilding effort.  By 2007, the level of output was expected to move back to the path it would have followed in the absence of the storm.  The staff revised upward its forecast of overall inflation for 2005 and of core inflation for 2006, reflecting the effects of higher energy prices, but lowered its projection for overall inflation slightly for 2006.  It was recognized that there were considerable near-term uncertainties and that many data series in coming months would be influenced by the effects of the storm.  In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that output and employment appeared to have been growing at a good pace before Hurricane Katrina\\'s landfall.  Business fixed investment had been a little softer than expected, but household spending had been especially strong.  Participants agreed that the widespread devastation in the Gulf Coast region and the dislocation of many people would hold down indicators of spending for a time.  But they also were of the view that aggregate demand and output would likely rebound before long, fueled in part by private spending to rebuild and outlays by the federal government to assist in the recovery.  With growth of the economy expected to recover, meeting participants were concerned that price pressures, which had been elevated before the storm, could climb further, primarily as a result of additional increases in energy prices.  Meeting participants recognized that Hurricane Katrina would have significant effects on the U.S. economy, but the size and timing of those effects were uncertain.  Economic activity in the Gulf Coast region would be disrupted by the destruction of capital and the displacement of a large population, perhaps for an extended period.  Moreover, damage to infrastructure for extracting and processing oil and natural gas was expected to be substantial, with significant near-term implications for energy prices and the national economy, and the projected track of Hurricane Rita raised additional concerns.  In that environment, the prices of crude oil, natural gas, and gasoline likely would remain elevated and subject to considerable volatility, particularly given the limited spare capacity available in energy extraction and refining industries.  Participants noted that very substantial rebuilding would probably be underway soon, supported importantly by government programs.  The pace at which reconstruction activity would take place, however, was uncertain, as it depended in part on factors that were still difficult to assess, such as how quickly the affected areas could again be made habitable.  On balance, participants thought that there would likely be a significant shift in the timing of aggregate economic activity over the next several quarters but probably little effect on the economy\\'s intermediate-term growth prospects.  Several participants voiced concern that the effects of the hurricane were likely to add to already considerable pressures on prices.For the nation as a whole, participants noted that household spending had been fairly robust before the hurricane, supported by strong advances in income and continuing gains in wealth that reflected in part further large increases in home prices.   Most anecdotal information supported the indications from available data that activity in housing markets generally remained brisk.  The termination of some inducements to purchase motor vehicles was expected to retard expenditures on consumer durables in the latter part of this year.  The reduction in real disposable incomes caused by large increases in consumer energy prices was also anticipated to restrain consumer spending, with business contacts indicating that retail outlets that typically serve lower- and middle-income households could see particular weakness.  The reduction in spending as a result of higher energy prices and hurricane-related dislocations could be augmented by a weakening of consumer attitudes.  Many of the restraining effects were thought likely to dissipate over time, however.  Retail energy prices were likely to retrace at least a portion of the post-hurricane increase, and consumer confidence should rebound.  Moreover, demands for consumer durables, as well as housing, would receive support as hurricane victims repaired or replaced lost property, with help from insurance payments and government transfers.  Although uncertainties about the outlook for spending had increased, it appeared that, over time, consumption would probably expand at a moderate pace--perhaps a little below the pace of income growth once the increases in house prices slowed to more historically typical rates.  Meeting participants noted that, even prior to the hurricane, business fixed investment had been somewhat weaker than expected.  The softness was somewhat puzzling, as sales were growing, business balance sheets appeared quite strong in the aggregate, profitability was high, and financing was readily available and relatively inexpensive for most firms.  Although the apparent sluggishness could reflect only short-term fluctuations in volatile data series, some evidence suggested that it may also have stemmed from concern among business executives about the effects of high energy prices.  The anecdotal information on commercial real estate markets was mixed, with some districts reporting firming markets while activity elsewhere was said to remain subpar.With regard to fiscal policy, meeting participants noted that federal outlays would increase sharply in order to assist with recovery and reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of the hurricane.  The eventual size of the increment to federal outlays was unclear, but it was likely to be quite large.  The substantial step-up in government spending would add to federal deficits that were already large and underscored the worrisome loss of fiscal discipline evident in recent years.  The expansion of federal spending implied an increase in fiscal stimulus at a time when the margin of unutilized resources in the overall economy was probably thin.  Participants\\' concerns about inflation prospects generally had increased over the intermeeting period.  The surge in energy prices, in particular, was boosting overall inflation, and some of that increase would probably pass through for a time into core prices.  This posed the risk that there could be a more persistent influence on inflation should inflation expectations rise.  Indeed, some recent survey evidence on such expectations had been troubling, and widening federal deficits were mentioned as a factor that could further stir inflationary concerns.  Measures of labor costs were giving conflicting signals, with some indexes indicating that growth in labor compensation remained relatively low but another showing appreciably more rapid increases.  Anecdotal information continued to point to shortages of certain types of labor, such as truck drivers, and some business contacts reported difficulties in hiring more generally, a development that had prompted some firms to boost wages.  Underlying productivity growth to date apparently had remained robust but, at this stage of the business cycle, gains in productivity could not necessarily be counted on to stay strong.  The prices of a number of intermediate goods, including a wide range of petrochemical products and building materials, were subject to upward pressure, reflecting high crude oil prices, production disruptions in the energy sector, and elevated demands for materials in anticipation of rebuilding in the Gulf Coast region.  Still, core inflation in recent months had been quite damped, and market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had risen only modestly of late.  It was observed that, after the early 1980s, the pass-through of energy prices into core inflation had been quite limited, suggesting that, in current circumstances, core inflation could stay relatively low and overall inflation would probably drop back if inflation expectations remained contained.In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, nearly all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 3-3/4 percent at this meeting.  Although uncertainty had increased, in the Committee\\'s judgment the fundamental factors influencing the longer-term path of the economy probably had not been affected by the hurricane, but the upside risks to inflation appeared to have increased.  Even after today\\'s action, the federal funds rate would likely be below the level that would be necessary to contain inflationary pressures, and further rate increases probably would be required.  Moreover, the uncertainties about near-term economic prospects resulting from Hurricane Katrina would probably not be reduced materially in coming weeks.  Indeed, underlying economic trends would be particularly difficult to assess over the next several months as a result of the direct, and presumably temporary, effects of the storm and its aftermath on the incoming data.  A pause in policy tightening at this meeting had the potential to mislead the public both about the Committee\\'s perceptions of the fundamental strength and resilience of the economy and about its commitment to fostering price stability.In discussing the statement to be released after the meeting, members agreed that it would be appropriate to characterize the macroeconomic effects of Hurricane Katrina, while significant, as essentially temporary.  Members also believed that the statement should again note that both monetary policy accommodation and robust underlying productivity growth were continuing to support economic activity.  Although energy prices had the potential to add to inflation pressures, and inflation expectations had recently exhibited some signs of increasing, members agreed that the risks to inflation, as well as those to growth, remained essentially balanced under an assumption of appropriate policy action.  The Committee also agreed to reiterate its previous expectation that \". . . policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.\"  However, some sentiment was expressed to consider changes to forward-looking aspects of the statement at upcoming meetings, in part because of the considerable reduction in monetary policy accommodation that had already been accomplished.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 3-3/4 percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\" Votes for this action:\\xa0Messrs.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy had a good deal of forward momentum in the third quarter.  Although recent hurricanes caused considerable damage and disruption, particularly in the energy sector, economic activity outside the Gulf region appeared to have been well maintained.  In September, hiring in other regions remained in line with its pace over the preceding twelve months, and excluding the estimated effects of the hurricanes and a strike by Boeing machinists, industrial production increased briskly.  In addition, residential construction remained buoyant.  Consumer spending, however, showed some signs of weakening.  Although consumer spending was strong for the third quarter as a whole, it softened in September, and survey measures of consumer confidence slumped noticeably.  Despite the large increase in consumer energy prices since midyear, core price inflation was restrained through September.Hurricane Rita caused further disruption to energy production in the Gulf area, which had not yet fully recovered from Hurricane Katrina.  Energy production in October was still below pre-hurricane levels, although progress had been made in reopening shut-down energy facilities.  Rising imports, along with more-subdued consumption of gasoline and other petroleum products, helped to offset the effect on energy prices of some of the output losses in refined products.  In addition, to address the low level of gasoline inventories and more-immediate retail demands, domestic refiners sharply increased the share of gasoline in their output of total refined product.  Wholesale and retail gasoline prices spiked soon after Rita\\'s landfall but had since declined to pre-hurricane levels.  Spot prices for natural gas soared with the hurricanes and remained at elevated levels.Payroll employment fell in September, held down by substantial job losses associated with Hurricane Katrina.  Employment in the areas unaffected by the hurricane increased at a rate in line with the average pace over the previous twelve months.  The largest employment loss occurred in the leisure and hospitality category, an industry particularly hard hit by the storm.  The average workweek was unchanged in September, so with employment lower, aggregate hours declined slightly.  The unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage points to 5.1 percent.  The labor force participation rate held steady, but the number of individuals reporting that they had a job but were not at work because of bad weather surged.  More recently, weekly data on initial claims for unemployment insurance suggested that the job losses associated with the hurricane were subsiding. Industrial production fell substantially in September, but excluding the effects of hurricane-related disturbances and the Boeing strike, industrial production was estimated to have risen at a brisk pace.  The hurricanes caused the index for oil and natural gas extraction and refining to plummet in September, and they also significantly affected petrochemical production.  Manufacturing output fell noticeably in the shipbuilding, food manufacturing, paper, and plywood industries.  In the transportation equipment category, motor vehicle production climbed notably, but the machinists\\' strike at Boeing caused the company to cease nearly all commercial aircraft production during the month.  High-tech output--led by strong gains in the production of semiconductors and communications equipment--surged in September.  Manufacturing capacity utilization dropped substantially in September, but was still noticeably above its year-earlier level.Real consumer spending increased at a moderate rate in the third quarter as a whole, although it declined in August and September after having risen substantially earlier in the summer.  The softening in spending of late reflected in part the diminishing boost to light vehicle sales from manufacturers\\' programs offering employee discounts to nonemployees.  Spending on other goods and services was also sluggish, likely because of the direct effects of the dislocation of households by the hurricanes, high energy prices, and falling consumer confidence.  Consumer sentiment in October, as measured by both the Michigan Survey and the Conference Board\\'s indicator, dropped a little further after plunging in September.  The personal saving rate remained slightly negative in September.Residential construction continued at a robust pace.  In September, new single-family homes were started at a rate a bit above their elevated average rate in the first half of the year, and permit issuance jumped to a new high.  New home sales remained substantial in August, but they were below July\\'s elevated level.  Although they remained low by historical standards, both the thirty-year fixed mortgage rate and the one-year adjustable rate had moved up a bit in recent months and were notably above the levels seen at the beginning of the year.  The average selling price of existing homes rose in the twelve months ending in September at about the same rapid clip as a year earlier, but the average selling price of new homes rose more slowly over the past few months.Real outlays for equipment and software were sluggish in the summer, but a broad-based pickup in orders for and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft in August suggested some firming.  Investment fundamentals remained relatively solid, including continued expansion in business sales, a declining cost of capital, and corporate balance sheets that were flush with cash.  Surveys of executive sentiment squared well with the fundamentals:  Although business leaders expressed some misgivings about the overall macroeconomic environment, their stated capital spending intentions pointed to increasing investment.  Vacancy rates for nonresidential properties continued to edge lower, but they remained elevated for office and industrial properties, and real spending on new construction had yet to improve materially.Business investment in real nonfarm inventories was subdued over the summer.  Although inventory-to-sales ratios moved down some in July and August, businesses did not appear dissatisfied with their level of stocks.  For example, September results from the Institute for Supply Management survey indicated that respondents viewed their customers\\' current inventory situation as reasonably well aligned with demand.The U.S. international trade deficit widened somewhat in August, as a surge in imports of goods and services was partially offset by a sizable gain in exports.  The growth in imports reflected both a marked increase in oil imports and a rise in nonoil goods; imports of services were little changed.  The increase in exports was driven by higher merchandise exports, although exports of services also advanced a bit.  GDP growth in foreign industrial economies appeared to have continued at a moderate pace in the third quarter.Soaring energy prices have boosted overall measures of consumer price inflation in recent months.  However, measures of core consumer price inflation were much more restrained.  The twelve-month change in core consumer prices through September was about unchanged from its year-earlier level.  One survey of households in October found that expectations for inflation over the coming year rose to a level well above the readings that had prevailed over the spring and summer, presumably in response to rising energy prices.  However, median expectations for inflation over the next five to ten years were only a little above the average range reported in recent years.  With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index for private industry workers rose at a moderate pace in the third quarter, up somewhat from its second-quarter pace, but the twelve-month change in the index declined from that of a year earlier.  Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector was estimated to have also risen at a moderate rate in the third quarter.At its September meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 3¾ percent.  In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  The Committee noted that the widespread devastation in the Gulf region from Hurricane Katrina, the associated dislocation of economic activity, and the boost to energy prices would set back spending, production, and employment in the near term.  However, the Committee judged that these unfortunate developments did not pose a more persistent threat to the overall economy.  Rather, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, was providing ongoing support to economic activity.  Although higher energy and other costs had the potential to add to inflation pressure, core inflation had been relatively low in the preceding few months and longer-term inflation expectations remained contained.  In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.With investors putting only small odds on a pause in the tightening cycle following Hurricane Katrina, there was little market reaction to the Committee\\'s decision at the September meeting.  However, the expected path for monetary policy shifted up in subsequent weeks, as incoming data indicated that output had been expanding briskly prior to the hurricanes and that the disruptions to economic activity from the hurricanes were likely to be less severe than initially feared.  This upward pressure on interest rates may have been amplified by comments from a number of Federal Reserve officials that were read as stressing inflation concerns.  Nominal Treasury yields rose in line with the shift in the outlook for monetary policy.  Despite a large increase in the overall consumer price index for September, measures of inflation compensation calculated using yields on nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities were about unchanged over the intermeeting period, although they remained a bit above the levels seen before Hurricane Katrina.  As broad indexes of investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields moved largely in line with Treasury yields over the period, spreads were little changed.  Major stock price indexes fell moderately and the trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.Domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have advanced briskly in the third quarter.  Growth in household debt was estimated to have edged down in the third quarter because of a slowing in mortgage debt growth but remained elevated.  Household bankruptcies surged in the weeks immediately before bankruptcy reforms went into effect on October 17.  The debt of nonfinancial businesses rose in the third quarter at a rate comparable to the increases seen in the first half of the year.  Bank loans to businesses continued to advance briskly, and the results of the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey showed some further easing of lending terms and standards for such loans.  M2 expanded at a fairly solid rate in September.  The increase in September was in part attributable to a boost to currency and liquid deposits resulting from Hurricane Katrina.  Growth in nominal output in the third quarter exceeded that of M2, implying a further rise in velocity.In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff continued to project moderate economic growth for the second half of 2005.  Output growth was expected to pick up in 2006, as the boost from hurricane-related rebuilding activity more than offset the effects of somewhat tighter financial conditions, and then slow in 2007, as the impetus from rebuilding waned.  The near-term forecast again entailed a marked downshift in headline inflation as energy prices fall back consistent with readings from futures markets.  Favorable incoming data led the staff to reduce its forecast for near-term core inflation a bit.  The outlook continued to be for core inflation to pick up modestly over coming quarters owing to the lagged effects of higher energy prices but then to return to near current levels in 2007 primarily as the result of the restraining influence of falling energy prices.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants saw the economy as continuing to grow at a solid pace, notwithstanding the disruptive effects to economic activity and employment from the hurricanes.  However, the near-term outlook continued to be subject to considerable uncertainty given the difficulties in assessing the net effects of the downturn in consumer confidence and the rise in energy prices through the summer, on the one hand, and the rebuilding from hurricane damage, on the other.  Although oil and gasoline prices had fallen in recent weeks and core inflation had remained benign, some businesses had reported increased ability to pass through cost increases in the environment of higher headline inflation.  On balance, meeting participants remained concerned about heightened inflation pressures.Meeting participants generally saw accumulating evidence as supporting the view that the disruptions to aggregate economic activity and employment from the hurricanes were likely to be limited and temporary.  In areas that had been devastated by the hurricanes, recovery of energy production and the rebuilding of homes and businesses might take longer than had been expected, in part because of a slow return of evacuees.  However, in regions just outside those that were most severely damaged, recovery was already well underway, and the pace of economic activity had strengthened, in some cases owing to spending by relocated households.  Reconstruction along the Gulf Coast would likely pick up substantially in the next couple of quarters.In the household sector, spending seemed to have held up fairly well, aside from a drop in purchases of autos.  Some participants noted, however, that the erosion of consumer confidence, still-elevated gasoline prices, and the prospect of higher heating bills might augur weakness ahead.  The housing market had remained robust, although a slowing in house price gains in some areas and recent declines in home equity lending at banks could be indicating that the long-expected cooling in the housing market was near.  Motor vehicle purchases had slowed substantially in October, but that seemed to owe primarily to the end of discount programs that had generated a surge in auto spending over the summer.  Over the longer-term, with house price gains moderating and perhaps greater perceived needs to invest for retirement purposes, the household saving rate was likely to rise gradually.Growth in business investment spending seemed to remain moderate overall, but anecdotal reports suggested that a number of firms had boosted their plans for capital spending.  Moreover, construction spending and commercial real estate investment seemed to be picking up in some areas.  Significant problems persisted amongst U.S. nameplates in the auto sector, however.  The rise in longer-term real interest rates and some widening of private credit spreads in recent months were seen as perhaps having a little restraining effect on the investment outlook.Economic growth in the near term was likely to be boosted by additional fiscal stimulus, in part to support recovery and rebuilding from the hurricanes.  Strong demand from overseas was evidently boosting exports this year by more than the increase in imports, with the nation\\'s external accounts thereby providing a small net positive contribution to growth in domestic production.  Next year, however, the arithmetic contribution to growth from net exports was seen as likely to return to negative territory.While participants noted some recent favorable data on core inflation and labor costs, upside risks to the outlook for underlying inflation remained a key concern.  Wage gains had remained modest relative to continued strong productivity growth, suggesting that labor costs were not putting much upward pressure on prices.  Indeed, core inflation continued to be subdued, and in recent weeks gasoline prices had unwound a significant portion of their steep increases.  Nevertheless, there was a risk that the large cumulative rise in energy and petroleum product prices through the summer would be transmitted to core consumer prices.  A number of firms had been reporting a greater ability to pass through increases in energy and other costs to customers, though evidently more so to other businesses than to consumers.  A survey measure of the near-term inflation expectations of households had risen notably, but intermediate- and longer-term inflation expectations implied by Treasury security yields had remained fairly stable.  It was noted, however, that longer-term expectations of inflation remained contained in the context of an increase in the extent of additional monetary policy tightening expected in financial markets. In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4 percent at this meeting.  The economy seemed to be growing at a fairly strong pace, despite the temporary disruptions associated with the hurricanes, and underlying economic slack was likely quite limited.  In that context, all members believed it important to continue removing monetary policy accommodation in order to check upside risks to inflation and keep inflation expectations contained, but noted that policy setting would need to be increasingly sensitive to incoming economic data.  Some members cautioned that risks of going too far with the tightening process could also eventually emerge.  Nonetheless, all members agreed to indicate at the conclusion of this meeting that a continued measured pace of policy firming remained likely.In their ongoing discussion of the Committee\\'s communication strategy, participants expressed a variety of perspectives about how the policy statement issued at the end of FOMC meetings might evolve over time.  Several aspects of the statement language would have to be changed before long, particularly those related to the characterization of and outlook for policy.  Possible future changes in the sentence on the balance of risks to the Committee\\'s objectives were also discussed.  Participants noted that any forward-looking elements of the statement should clearly be conditioned on the outlook for inflation and economic growth.  For this meeting, members concurred that the current statement structure could be retained, as it accurately conveyed their near-term economic and policy outlook.In view of the continued rapid pace of observed productivity gains, members agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should again indicate that robust underlying productivity growth and monetary policy accommodation were supporting the economic expansion.  Those influences were expected to be augmented by planned rebuilding and recovery activity in hurricane-affected areas.  While gasoline prices had recently moved lower, the cumulative rise in energy prices and other costs was seen as having the potential to add to inflation pressures.  However, core inflation had been subdued in recent months and longer-run inflation expectations remained contained.  Against that backdrop, the risks to the objective of price stability, as well as that for sustainable growth, remained in balance, given appropriate monetary policy actions. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks   monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4 percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.

There were no open         market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the         period since the previous meeting. The Manager also reported on developments         in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in         government securities and federal agency obligations during the period         since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified         these transactions. The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy         continued to expand at a solid rate in the fourth quarter. Industrial         production rebounded, and employment growth appeared to have recovered         smartly from the depressing effects of recent hurricanes. Although some         scattered signs of cooling of the housing sector had emerged, the pace         of construction activity and sales remained brisk. More broadly, spending         by consumers and businesses was well maintained. Core consumer price inflation         remained subdued, even though some of the increase in energy costs had         apparently passed through to prices of final goods and services.  Private nonfarm payrolls grew rapidly in November after a small gain         in October. Construction employment posted another large increase, probably         owing in part to hurricane-related activity. Broad-based gains in durable         goods industries augmented manufacturing employment, and employment in         the related industries of temporary help services and wholesale trade         increased as well. With employment rising but the average workweek of         production or nonsupervisory workers falling slightly, aggregate hours         slipped in November--albeit to a level above that of their third-quarter         average. The unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent, and the labor         force participation rate was also unchanged. Survey measures of individuals\\'         expectations of future labor market conditions improved in November, largely         reversing post-Katrina declines.  Industrial production rebounded in October after having been held down         in September by hurricanes and by a strike at Boeing. The resumption of         commercial aircraft production boosted manufacturing output and more than         offset a fall in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Large output         gains in hurricane-affected industries--such as segments of the food,         rubber and plastics, and paper industries--also contributed to the         increase in manufacturing output. The growth of high-tech output slowed         slightly in October, mainly as a result of smaller increases in the production         of semiconductors. In contrast, production of communication equipment--particularly         data networking equipment--accelerated. With many energy facilities         in the Gulf region still closed, output at mines, which is defined to         include oil and gas extraction, slipped further in October. Manufacturing         capacity utilization moved up again in October and was only a touch below         its long-run average.  Real personal consumption expenditures appeared to be increasing solidly         over the course of the fourth quarter, led by improvements in the fundamental         determinants of consumer spending. Real disposable personal income was         bolstered by gains in employment and falling retail energy prices, while         continued brisk advances in house prices and the recent strengthening         of equity prices contributed importantly to increases in household wealth.         Consumer sentiment picked up in November and early December; some survey         measures of confidence returned to the range seen during the first half         of the year. The personal saving rate--while still slightly negative--moved         up in October. Activity in the housing market remained brisk despite a rise in mortgage         interest rates. Starts of new single-family homes dropped back somewhat         in October from September\\'s very strong pace, but permit issuance         remained elevated. New home sales reached a new high in October, and existing         home sales eased off only a little from the high levels recorded during         the summer. Other available indicators of housing activity were on the         soft side: An index of mortgage applications for purchases of homes declined         in November, and builders\\' ratings of new home sales had fallen         off in recent months. In addition, survey measures of homebuying attitudes         had declined to levels last observed in the early 1990s.  Real outlays for equipment and software posted a solid gain in the third         quarter. Although business purchases of motor vehicles declined in October         and November, growth in investment in nontransportation equipment appeared         to have been well maintained in the fourth quarter. Rising business sales,         a declining cost of capital, and ample financial resources in the corporate         sector continued to foster a favorable environment for capital spending,         a sentiment echoed in executive surveys, which generally pointed to widespread         increases in planned capital outlays. Real spending on nonresidential         construction improved materially in the third quarter, boosted by substantial         gains in drilling and mining expenditures. Real nonfarm inventories ran off in the third quarter as automakers         pared their motor vehicle stocks. But even outside the motor vehicle sector,         inventory investment was relatively restrained, and partial data for October         suggested that real stockbuilding continued to be subdued. The level of         stocks appeared reasonably well aligned with sales. The U.S. international trade deficit reached a new record in September.         A surge in imports was accompanied by a fairly sizable drop in exports,         part of which was due to a steep falloff in aircraft exports as a result         of the strike at Boeing. The jump in the value of imports was driven by         strong growth in most categories of goods and, to a lesser extent, growth         in services; increases in the dollar value of imports of oil and of industrial         supplies--especially natural gas--were particularly strong,         a reflection of higher prices. Foreign industrialized economies expanded         robustly in the third quarter, and available indicators for the fourth         quarter appeared promising, on balance.  Core consumer price inflation was moderate in recent months, although         some signs of pass-through of higher energy costs were evident, especially         in transportation services. Consumer energy prices had retreated notably         from their elevated post-hurricane levels. Wholesale and retail gasoline         prices dropped as gasoline inventories rebounded. And spot prices for         natural gas fell sharply through mid-November amidst unusually temperate         weather, plentiful inventories, and declining prices of competing fuels;         unusually cold weather in early December, however, caused spot prices         to move back up to their October levels. Presumably in response to falling         retail energy prices, one survey of households in November and early December         showed a marked retreat in expectations for inflation over the coming         year. Longer-term inflation expectations also edged down, but stayed a         touch above the narrow range observed in recent years. Although recent         increases in energy costs had pushed up producer prices in some sectors,         overall producer price inflation remained subdued. With regard to labor         costs, the twelve-month change in the employment cost index for private         industry workers in September was well below its year-ago increase. Hourly         compensation in the nonfarm business sector also appeared to have slowed         a bit recently. At its November meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to         increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to         4 percent. In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that,         with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks         to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be         kept roughly equal. The Committee also noted that elevated energy prices         and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity had temporarily         depressed output and employment. However, monetary policy accommodation,         coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, was providing ongoing         support to economic activity. And although the cumulative rise in energy         and other costs had the potential to add to inflation pressures, core         inflation had been relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation         expectations remained contained. In these circumstances, the Committee         believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was         likely to be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic         prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Market participants widely anticipated the Committee\\'s decision         at its November meeting, and the policy announcement evoked little reaction         in financial markets. Over the intermeeting period, investors marked up         slightly their expectations for the path of monetary policy in light of         stronger-than-expected data on spending and production. Nominal Treasury         yields changed little, on net, but measures of inflation compensation         at longer horizons--which are calculated using yields on nominal         and inflation-protected securities--declined somewhat. Credit spreads         on both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds were about unchanged         over the intermeeting period. Major equity price indexes posted substantial         gains, spurred by the perception that the economy had retained considerable         momentum with limited inflation pressures. In foreign exchange markets,         the trade-weighted value of the dollar was about unchanged over the intermeeting         period. The expansion of domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have moderated         a little from its brisk third-quarter pace. Consumer credit dipped in         October, and nonfinancial firms\\' net borrowing in the form of bank         loans, commercial paper, and bonds was a bit below the third-quarter pace.         Household bankruptcies hovered at very low levels in recent weeks after         soaring to unprecedented heights just before the implementation of more-stringent         bankruptcy rules in mid-October. Hurricane relief payments apparently         boosted M2 in October, but that aggregate decelerated in November, partly         reflecting the continued rise in the opportunity cost of holding liquid         deposits. The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that growth of         economic activity would slow from this year\\'s pace, but remain solid,         with output staying near the economy\\'s potential over the next two         years. Although hurricane-related rebuilding would boost activity, especially         in the near term, this stimulus increasingly would be countered by higher         interest rates, the anticipated waning of the positive wealth effect associated         with large earlier gains in equity and house prices, and reduced impetus         from fiscal policy. Both overall and core consumer price inflation were         projected to move higher in the first half of next year, reflecting the         effects of higher energy prices, but then to trend lower as those effects         ebb.  In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants         noted that incoming data over the intermeeting period had been encouraging         with regard to both economic growth and inflation. The economic expansion         had shown considerable resilience in the face of higher energy prices         and hurricane-related disruptions, suggesting greater underlying strength         than had been apparent at the time of the November meeting. At the same         time, incoming inflation data had been benign, indicating relatively modest         pass-through of higher energy prices to core inflation to date; subdued         gains in compensation and strong growth in productivity were holding down         business costs; and inflation expectations, which had jumped after the         hurricanes, had fallen back. Nonetheless, with growth solid and prices         of energy products still well above levels earlier in the year, possible         increases in resource utilization had the potential to add to pressures         on prices, especially in the absence of some further firming of policy. In their discussion of major sectors of the economy, meeting participants         noted that, while light vehicle sales had slowed in the fall, consumer         spending outside the auto sector appeared to have remained vigorous. Holiday         sales were said to be off to a good start in many parts of the country.         The substantial recovery in measures of consumer confidence after their         sharp declines in the aftermath of the hurricanes had reduced meeting         participants\\' concerns about a significant pull-back in spending.         Going forward, consumer outlays were expected to be supported by further         advances in employment and income. Meeting participants discussed tentative signs that activity was beginning         to slow in the housing sector. Reports from contacts in many parts of         the country suggested somewhat less ebullient market conditions, and measures         of confidence of homebuyers and builders had fallen back noticeably. A         downshift in attitudes regarding the outlook for the housing sector could         have significant market effects, in part by damping the demand for houses         by investors and speculators. A slowing of house price increases, by restraining         the expansion of consumption, and a moderation in the pace of new building         were expected to reduce the growth of aggregate demand somewhat in coming         quarters. To date, however, the national data on home prices, sales, and         construction activity did not suggest a significant weakening in the sector.        Business investment spending had accelerated some since midyear. In         part, the pickup may have reflected an increase in business confidence         as the economy proved resilient in the face of this year\\'s substantial         adverse shocks. Participants noted that the improved performance of investment         suggested that the expansion was becoming more balanced, with strengthening         business spending potentially offsetting some moderation in the growth         of household spending from the elevated rates of recent years.  Economic activity also could be buoyed by developments in other sectors         of the economy. Increased federal government outlays were expected to         boost output a little next year. Supportive financial conditions and an         apparent increase in confidence had contributed to a pickup in growth         abroad. Despite possible firming of monetary policy by some foreign central         banks and the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar owing to         global demands for dollar assets, a good portion of the recent strength         in foreign economic growth was expected to persist and provide support         for U.S. exports.  In their discussion of prices, participants indicated that their concerns         about near-term inflation pressures had eased somewhat over the intermeeting         period. Recent data suggested that, thus far, indirect effects of elevated         energy prices on core inflation had been muted. Moreover, energy prices         generally had fallen back on balance since earlier in the fall, and much         of the increases in inflation expectations posted in the aftermath of         the hurricanes had reversed. Participants noted that robust competition--including         that from foreign producers--and further substantial gains in productivity         were helping to contain cost and price pressures. Moreover, measures of         labor compensation showed only moderate gains while relatively wide profit         margins could allow firms to absorb somewhat larger increases in labor         and other costs without boosting prices. Nonetheless, surveys and anecdotal         reports suggested that some firms were successfully passing at least a         portion of their increased costs on to customers, and many participants         remained concerned that elevated energy prices could put pressure on core         inflation. Also, in the view of a number of participants, the economy         was possibly producing in the neighborhood of its potential, and the persistent         strength in spending of late suggested that resource markets could tighten         further and inflation pressures build. Under these circumstances, and         with policy having been accommodative for some time, inflation expectations         could rise if monetary policy were not seen as responding to contain such         risks.  In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting         period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis         points to 4-1/4 percent. With spending apparently retaining considerable         momentum, and with the indirect effects of increased energy prices still         threatening to raise core inflation at least for a time, the Committee         thought that additional policy firming at this meeting was appropriate         to keep inflation and inflation expectations in check. Committee members         generally anticipated that policy would likely need to be firmed further         going forward. In that process, the Committee would need to be mindful         of the lags in the effect of policy firming on the economy. However, it         would also have to take account of the effects of the sustained period         of favorable financial conditions on asset prices and aggregate demand         as well as the resulting possibility of further increases in resource         utilization and pressures on prices. Views differed on how much further         tightening might be required. Because the Committee\\'s actions over         the past eighteen months had significantly reduced the degree of monetary         policy accommodation, members thought that the policy outlook was becoming         considerably less certain and that policy decisions going forward would         depend to an increased extent on the implications of incoming economic         data for future growth and inflation.  The Committee agreed that several changes in the wording of the announcement         to be released after today\\'s meeting would be appropriate. The federal         funds rate had been boosted substantially, and, in the view of some members,         it was now likely within a broad range of values that might turn out to         be consistent with output remaining close to potential. In these circumstances,         the Committee thought that policy should no longer be characterized as         accommodative. Members concurred that the statement should note that the         expansion remained solid despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related         disruptions. While inflation and long-term inflation expectations remained         contained, the Committee agreed that the announcement should indicate         that possible increases in resource utilization, as well as elevated energy         prices, had the potential to add to inflation pressures and that \"some         further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks         to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability         roughly in balance.\" Although future action would depend on the         incoming data, this characterization of the outlook for policy was seen         by most members as indicating that, given the information now in hand,         the number of additional firming steps required probably would not be         large. Some members thought that the word \"measured\" was no         longer necessary, but its retention for this meeting was seen as potentially         useful to preclude a possible misinterpretation that the Committee now         saw a significant possibility of adjusting policy in larger increments         in the near future. Wording of the announcement along these lines was         not expected to have a substantial effect on market expectations for policy,         though such effects were especially difficult to judge given the extensive         changes being made to the statement. The members agreed that the announcement         should end by noting that policy will respond to changes in economic prospects         as needed to foster the Committee\\'s objectives. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct         the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise,         to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following         domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial         conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth         in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate         future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing         the federal funds rate to an average of around 4-1/4 percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in         the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee judges that some further measured policy firming         is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable         economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event,         the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed         to foster these objectives.\"Votes for this action: Messrs.

The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; (b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account.(c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States to dealers for System Open Market Account under agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers.2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be determined by competitive bidding.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and apply reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue that may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each dealer may borrow.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could facilitate a dealer's ability to control a single issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agency  accounts maintained at the Bank.  Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.4. In the execution of the Committee's decision regarding policy during any intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate.  Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee's discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period.  Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any adjustment.With Mr. Lacker dissenting, the Committee approved the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations with an amendment to paragraph 5 which clarifies the language about permissible investment activities for the foreign portfolio and brings that language into alignment with that present in the authorization for the domestic portfolio.  Accordingly, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations was adopted, effective January 31, 2006, as shown below.  AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS(Amended January 31, 2006)1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent necessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time to time:\", 'Minutes of the Federal Open Market CommitteeMarch 27-28, 2006A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held in the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C., on Monday, March 27,2006 at 3:00 p.m. and continued on Tuesday, March 28, 2006 at 9:00 a.m.Present:Mr. Bernanke, ChairmanMr. Geithner, Vice ChairmanMs. BiesMr. GuynnMr. KohnMr. KrosznerMr. LackerMr. OlsonMs. PianaltoMr. WarshMs. YellenMses.

Rasche, Rolnick, and Rudebusch, Senior Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago,  Kansas City, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, respectivelyMs. Mosser, Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions. The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding strongly in the first quarter.  Consumer spending was on track to rise at a robust pace, and business purchases of equipment and software picked up appreciably.  Warm weather boosted housing construction in January and February, although sales of new homes dropped back and house prices decelerated slightly.  Private payrolls advanced solidly in the first two months of the year.  Headline consumer price inflation jumped in January but moderated in February as energy prices moved down.  Core inflation remained contained. Labor demand continued to increase in the first two months of 2006, as private nonfarm payroll employment showed large gains in both January and February.  With favorable weather conditions, employment growth was especially brisk in the construction sector.  Financial activities, business services, and nonbusiness services also posted solid payroll gains.  Although the average workweek edged down in February, the level of aggregate hours for production and nonsupervisory workers was above its average for the fourth quarter of 2005.  The unemployment rate continued to decline and averaged 4¾ percent over the first two months of the year.  Several other labor market indicators also signaled a further tightening of labor market conditions. Industrial production picked up in February after a modest decline in January.  That pattern was attributable to swings in utilities output, as temperatures were historically warm early in the year before reverting to near seasonal norms in February.  Excluding utilities, industrial production posted a sizable gain in January before flattening out in February, pointing to a solid rise in the first quarter.  Mining output--which includes oil and natural gas extraction--slipped in February after registering robust gains in each of the previous three months.  Manufacturing output was unchanged in February after a significant increase in January.  The rate of capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector stood a bit above its long-run average. Consumer spending appeared to have rebounded strongly in the first quarter.  Motor vehicle purchases bounced back in late 2005 and early 2006 from the sluggish pace that followed the end of the past summer\\'s \"employee pricing\" programs.  Excluding motor vehicles, consumption spending was robust, supported by continuing improvement in the labor market and advances in wage and salary income.  The annual raise in the pay of federal employees, cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security benefits and other transfer programs, and the initiation of the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan boosted the level of personal disposable income in January.  Consumption was likely supported also by ongoing increases in home prices and gains in the stock market.  Consumer confidence as measured by surveys remained consistent with moderate increases in consumer spending. Housing activity had moderated somewhat from the robust pace of the past summer.  Although the level of single-family housing starts was unusually high in January and February, much of this strength was likely the result of mild winter weather; new permit issuance extended the downward trajectory that began in October.  After an unusual spike in January, multifamily housing starts dropped back in February to a rate well within their historical range.  Sales of new homes fell in the first two months of the year, while sales of existing homes turned up in February for the first time since last August; both measures were well below their peaks of mid-2005.  The stock of homes for sale was elevated compared with its range of the last several years.  Mortgage applications continued to decline in February, and survey measures of homebuying attitudes also maintained their recent downward trend.  Housing demand was likely damped by rising mortgage rates, which moved up further in late 2005 and early 2006.  House price appreciation appeared to have slowed from the rapid pace of the summer, but price increases for both new and existing homes remained well within the elevated range that has prevailed in recent years. Real outlays for equipment and software decelerated in the fourth quarter of 2005 but appeared to have gained strength in early 2006.  This pattern reflected sizable swings in outlays for transportation equipment.  The fundamentals underlying capital spending continued to be supportive, as business sector output expanded briskly, firms remained flush with funds, and relative price declines for high-tech equipment continued to push down its user cost.  Although vacancy rates for nonresidential properties were well below the peaks reached in the first quarter of 2004, real spending on new construction had yet to gain traction.  In contrast, outlays for drilling and mining structures continued to rise rapidly and appeared poised to increase further in the near term. The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles rose at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter of 2005, and inventories appeared to have continued to build in January.  Much of the increase reflected rising prices of goods held, and real inventory accumulation was subdued.  The inventory-sales ratio declined slightly in January, extending its long-run downward trend.  Inventory stocks appeared to be well aligned with demand in most industries. The U.S. international trade deficit rose in the fourth quarter and widened further in January, as gains in exports of goods and services were outweighed by a substantially larger rise in imports.  Exports of industrial supplies, capital goods, and agricultural products picked up robustly in January, while the increase in imports was widespread across most product categories.  Real GDP growth in foreign industrial economies was mixed in the fourth quarter, as economic activity slowed in the euro area and in Canada while the Japanese economy expanded briskly and growth in the United Kingdom firmed.  Recent indicators of economic activity in developing economies were generally quite positive. Readings on core consumer price inflation were favorable in recent months.  Nonetheless, the overall consumer price index edged up in February after registering a large increase in January that was driven mostly by a spike in energy prices.  While prices of food and core items recorded only modest increases in February, energy prices fell back amid increases in oil inventories and unseasonably mild temperatures since the latter part of December.  Weekly data for March, however, indicated that gasoline prices rose sharply.  Prices of capital equipment inched up in February after a more substantial gain in January.  Nevertheless, prices of capital equipment decelerated over the past twelve months.  Higher energy prices still seemed to be passing through to the prices of a number of core intermediate materials, although such increases were more moderate than those observed in the immediate aftermath of the hurricanes last autumn.  The increase in the employment cost index in the fourth quarter of 2005 was relatively modest.  Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, after having increased substantially in the third quarter, was estimated to have risen somewhat less in the fourth quarter.  Preliminary survey measures of short-term inflation expectations in March edged up, but longer-term measures remained steady. At its January meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4½ percent.  In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, although recent economic data had been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid.  Core inflation had stayed relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations had remained contained.  Nevertheless, the Committee noted that possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices had the potential to add to inflation pressures.  In these circumstances, the Committee judged that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance but reiterated that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster its objectives. Investors had largely anticipated both the Committee\\'s interest rate decision at the January meeting and the text of the accompanying statement.  Consequently, the policy announcement elicited little market reaction.  Policy expectations and yields on Treasury coupon securities subsequently firmed, on net, over the intermeeting period, as incoming data indicated robust economic growth in the United States and strengthening expansion abroad.  Yields on investment-grade corporate debt rose roughly in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, while yields on speculative-grade corporate debt were little changed.  Broad stock market indexes were modestly higher amid favorable economic news and lower oil prices, and the trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated slightly over the period. Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt appeared to have moderated only a bit in the first quarter from its robust pace in the fourth quarter of 2005.  Net issuance of corporate bonds and expansion of business loans at commercial banks had abated in February and early March after robust growth in January; commercial paper outstanding was about flat in the first quarter.  Household mortgage borrowing was thought to have slowed somewhat in the first quarter in response to increased mortgage interest rates.  Consumer credit rebounded some in January after contracting in the fourth quarter because of elevated charge-offs related to the spike in bankruptcy filings.  Based on monthly Treasury statements, federal debt seemed likely to have accelerated in the first quarter.  On average, M2 grew briskly in January and February.  While liquid deposits expanded moderately, small time deposits and retail money funds advanced strongly, supported by further increases in offering rates. The staff forecast prepared for this meeting showed real GDP expanding briskly in the current quarter.  Economic growth was expected to moderate later this year.  The level of output in the current quarter was estimated to be close to the economy\\'s potential and was anticipated to remain so over the projection period.  Core PCE inflation was expected to move slightly higher in 2006 because of cost pressures induced by high energy and import prices and to step back down in 2007 as these cost pressures were anticipated to abate. In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants saw the economy as having rebounded strongly from the slowdown in the fourth quarter of last year, with aggregate spending and employment expanding briskly in the current quarter.  Growth was expected to moderate to a more sustainable pace later this year.  The ongoing cooling in the housing market would act to restrain residential construction and growth in consumption, but business and household confidence and supportive financial conditions would help to foster growth in employment and incomes, keeping consumption and investment on a solid upward track.  Several meeting participants observed that, although the economy\\'s sustainable potential output could not be observed directly or estimated with precision, historical patterns and recent data suggested that current levels of labor and product market resource utilization were in a zone consistent with little or no remaining economic slack.  The recent behavior of core consumer prices seemed to indicate that any pass-through of higher energy and other commodity prices had been limited.  In addition, productivity growth, moderate increases in compensation, contained inflation expectations, and international competition were helping to restrain unit labor costs and price pressures.  Nonetheless, meeting participants generally remained concerned about the risk that possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, could add to inflation pressures. Regarding the major sectors of the economy, meeting participants noted that consumer spending appeared to be growing at a solid pace, notwithstanding earlier rises in energy prices.  Contacts in the retail sector reported strong demand, and lending to households seemed to be robust.  However, some automobile dealers reported subdued demand for domestic name-plate products.  In coming quarters, consumer outlays were expected to be supported by continued employment gains, household income growth, and relatively low long-term interest rates, even if gains in housing wealth abated. Meeting participants discussed at some length signs of cooling in the residential real estate market.  Published data on housing starts showed little evidence of a significant weakening in construction activity.  However, anecdotal reports from several markets, surveys of homebuyer attitudes, and data on inventories, home sales, and new home cancellation rates all pointed to a moderation in housing activity.  It was noted that the relatively robust data on construction activity could owe in part to unseasonably warm weather.  Going forward, participants expected a deceleration in house prices to contribute to an increase in the household saving rate and to weigh on consumption growth.  Aggregate demand was also expected to be restrained directly by a softening in the pace of home building.  Moreover, rebuilding following last year\\'s major hurricanes appeared to be proceeding at a slow pace, and so would provide only limited offset to the implications of more fundamental developments in this market. Generally, however, the economic expansion appeared to be broad-based.  Contacts indicated that certain sectors, such as energy and semiconductor production, were particularly strong.  Against this backdrop, robust growth in business spending was seen as likely, even as household spending growth moderated somewhat.  Business capital expenditures, especially on equipment and software, appeared to have considerable momentum, supported by strong corporate profits, exceptionally liquid balance sheets, and greater business optimism.  Some participants indicated that nonresidential construction was in the process of picking up and commercial vacancy rates were declining in some regions. Financial market conditions remained supportive of growth, with long-term rates relatively low, risk spreads in corporate debt markets narrow, and banks seeking lending opportunities.  Merger and acquisition activity was strong and infusions of private equity continued at a rapid pace, but the domestic market for initial public offerings was reported to be quite weak.  Although rates on fixed-rate mortgages remained historically low, some ratcheting up of rates on adjustable-rate mortgages was seen as a factor weighing to some degree on the housing market.  More generally, the effects on spending of the substantial increase in short- and intermediate-term rates since June 2004 had probably not yet been fully felt. There were reports of increased construction by state and local governments, which were benefiting from strong tax collections.  Federal defense expenditures had leveled out.  Foreign economic growth appeared to have strengthened of late, prompting some firming of monetary policy by several foreign central banks.  Nonetheless, increases in imports were expected to continue to outpace increases in exports in coming quarters, trimming the rate of expansion of domestic output. Meeting participants saw both upside and downside risks to their outlook for expansion around the rate of growth of the economy\\'s potential.  In the housing market, for instance, some downshift from the rapid price increases and strong activity of recent years seemed to be underway, but the magnitude of the adjustment and its effects on household spending were hard to predict.  Some participants cited stronger growth abroad and robust nonresidential investment spending as potentially contributing more to activity than expected.  It was also noted that an abrupt rise in long-term interest rates, reflecting, for example, a reversion of currently low term premiums to more typical levels, could weigh on both household and business spending. Several participants noted that the labor market had continued to strengthen, with payrolls increasing at a solid pace.  The labor market was now showing some signs of tightness, consistent with a relatively low jobless rate.  There were anecdotal reports of shortages of skilled labor in a few sectors, such as health care, technology, and finance.  Still, participants expressed uncertainty about how much slack remained.  Pressures on unit labor costs appeared contained, despite rising health-care costs, amid continued robust productivity growth and still-moderate increases in several comprehensive measures of compensation growth. In their discussion of prices, participants indicated that data over the intermeeting period, including measures of inflation expectations, suggested that underlying inflation was not in the process of moving higher.  Crude oil prices, though volatile, had not risen appreciably in recent months on balance, and a flattening in energy prices was beginning to damp headline inflation.  In addition, core consumer inflation was flat or even a bit lower by some measures.  Some meeting participants expressed surprise at how little of the previous rise in energy prices appeared to have passed through into core inflation measures.  However, with energy prices remaining high, and prices of some other commodities continuing to rise, the risk of at least a temporary impact on core inflation remained a concern.  Participants noted that there were as yet few signs that any tightness in product and labor markets was adding to inflation pressures.  To date, unit labor costs were not placing pressure on inflation, and high profit margins left firms a considerable buffer to absorb cost increases.  Moreover, actual and potential competition from abroad could be restraining cost and price pressures, though participants exchanged views on the extent to which conditions in foreign markets might be constraining prices domestically.  However, participants observed that there was a risk that continuing increases in resource utilization could add to inflationary pressures.  Some participants held that core inflation and inflation expectations were already toward the upper end of the range that they viewed as consistent with price stability, making them particularly vigilant about upside risks to inflation, especially given how costly it might be to bring inflation expectations back down if they were to rise. In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4¾ percent at this meeting.  The economy seemed to be on track to grow near a sustainable pace with core inflation remaining close to recent readings against a backdrop of financial conditions embodying an expectation of some tightening.  Since the available indicators showed that the economy could well be producing in the neighborhood of its sustainable potential and that aggregate demand remained strong, keeping rates unchanged would run an unacceptable risk of rising inflation.  Most members thought that the end of the tightening process was likely to be near, and some expressed concerns about the dangers of tightening too much, given the lags in the effects of policy.  However, members also recognized that in current circumstances, checking upside risks to inflation was important to sustaining good economic performance.  The need for further policy firming would be determined by the implications of incoming information for future activity and inflation. With regard to the Committee\\'s announcement to be released after the meeting, members expressed some difference in views about the appropriate level of detail to include in the statement.  In the end, they concurred that the statement should note that economic growth had rebounded in the current quarter but that it appeared likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace in coming quarters.  Policymakers agreed that the announcement should also highlight the favorable outlook for inflation and summarize their reasons for that assessment, but that it should reiterate that possible increases in resource utilization, along with elevated levels of commodity and energy prices, had the potential to add to inflation pressures.  Changes in the sentence on the balance of risks to the Committee\\'s objectives were discussed.  Several members were concerned that market participants might not fully appreciate the extent to which future policy action will depend on incoming economic data, especially when an end to the tightening process seems likely to be near.  Some members expressed concern that retention of the phrase \"some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks...roughly in balance\" could be misconstrued as suggesting that the Committee thought that several further tightening steps were likely to be necessary.  Nonetheless, all concurred that the current risk assessment could be retained at this meeting.  The Committee also discussed its experience with the two-day meeting.  Participants agreed that the additional time had facilitated their discussion of the economy, policy, and the wording of the announcement.  It was agreed that, because of scheduling conflicts, the next meeting of the Committee would be held on one day, Wednesday, May 10, 2006.  After experience with that and perhaps the subsequent meeting that is already scheduled for two days, a decision would be taken about the general format of future meetings. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4¾ percent.\" The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.\"Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke and Geithner, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Guynn, Kohn, Kroszner, Lacker, and Olson, Ms. Pianalto, Mr. Warsh, and Ms.Yellen. Vote against this action: None.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.With Mr. Lacker dissenting, the Committee voted to extend for one year beginning in mid-December 2006 the reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Banco de Mexico.  The arrangement with the Bank of Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent, and that with the Banco de Mexico is in the amount of $3 billion equivalent.  Both arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve\\'s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994.  The vote to renew the System\\'s participation in the swap arrangements maturing in December was taken at this meeting because of the provision that each party must provide six months prior notice of an intention to terminate its participation.  Mr. Lacker dissented because of his opposition, as indicated at the January meeting, to foreign exchange market intervention by the Federal Reserve, which such swap arrangements facilitate, and because of his opposition to direct lending to foreign central banks.  By unanimous vote, the Committee delegated the authority to review and determine appeals of a denial of access to Committee records under FOIA and other rules to the Board members designated as the primary and alternate Administrative Governors for Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Matters.  Also by unanimous vote, the Committee established a FOIA Requester Service Center and designated Carol R. Low to fulfill the associated responsibilities.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity expanded strongly in the first quarter and that gains were widespread across most categories of final sales.  Consumer spending posted a sizable increase, driven by January\\'s bounceback in motor vehicle purchases and an acceleration in spending on other goods at the turn of the year.  In addition, favorable weather boosted housing construction early in the quarter.  Later in the quarter, however, the pace of consumer spending moderated, and housing starts retraced their earlier run-up.  Business investment spending strengthened in the first quarter, in part because of a surge in the purchases of transportation and high-tech equipment and a step-up in nonresidential construction.  Manufacturing production also posted solid gains in the first quarter and payroll growth moderated a bit in April after robust gains in employment in the first quarter.  Overall consumer prices jumped in March because of higher energy prices, while core prices rose a bit more rapidly than in earlier months.Nonfarm payrolls increased by 138,000 jobs in April following robust growth in March.  The gains in April were widespread: Manufacturing and related industries registered significant increases, mining activity and employment were boosted by rising energy prices, construction hiring posted a moderate gain, and a range of services-producing industries strengthened, with the important exception of retail trade, which more than reversed its March gains.  Average hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls edged up in April.  The increases in the workweek and employment in April led to notable growth in aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers.  The unemployment rate edged down to 4.7 percent in March and remained at that level in April.Industrial production in March expanded at about the same strong pace as it did in February, with gains posted across all major components of the index.  Manufacturing activity picked up in March after a lull in February.  While manufacturing growth for the first quarter as a whole slowed from the rapid pace of the fourth quarter, it exceeded that of the previous year.  Manufacturing capacity utilization during the quarter was a bit above its long-run average.  Mining output--which includes oil and natural gas extraction--strengthened in the first quarter as a whole.  Within the quarter, however, the boost from hurricane-related recovery seemed to ebb.  While utility output surged in February and moved up a bit more in March, these increases only partly reversed the weather-related plunge in January.  Growth of consumer spending appeared to moderate after posting sizable gains around the turn of the year.  Excluding motor vehicles, real outlays rose temperately in March, boosted by the continued rise in spending on services.  Spending on goods excluding motor vehicles posted a second-straight monthly decline after robust gains over the previous four months.  Sales of light vehicles held steady in March and picked up a bit in April, bringing the average pace for the year well above that of the fourth quarter but about even with the rate of last year.  Although continued improvements in the labor market had been generating considerable gains in nominal wage and salary income, rising gasoline prices held down the increase in real disposable personal income in March and were expected to damp it in April as well.  Ongoing increases in home prices and additional gains in the stock market, however, further boosted household wealth during the first quarter.  Measures of consumer confidence remained consistent with moderate increases in consumer spending.The underlying pace of residential activity seemed to moderate in the first quarter.  After unseasonably warm weather allowed a high level of single-family housing starts in January and February, starts fell in March to their lowest level in a year.  New permit issuance for single-family homes also fell in March, continuing its downward trend.  Multifamily starts recovered a bit in March from their low rate in February but remained well within their historical range.  Home sales also declined, on net, in recent months.  Although sales of existing single-family homes edged up in February and March, the level of sales for the first quarter as a whole was notably below the record high in the second quarter of last year.  Sales of new homes also moved up in March, but their average in the first quarter was down substantially from the peak in the third quarter of last year.  House price appreciation appeared to have slowed from the elevated rates seen over the past summer.  Growth in the average sales price of existing homes in March, versus a year earlier, decelerated sharply, and the average price for new homes in March fell compared to a year earlier. In addition, other indicators, such as months\\' supply of both new and existing homes for sale and the index of pending home sales, supported the view that housing markets had cooled in recent months.  Real outlays for equipment and software surged in the first quarter after a relatively subdued performance in the fourth quarter of last year.  Much of the growth reflected a sharp jump in business purchases of transportation equipment, such as airplanes and motor vehicles.  Spending on high-tech equipment and software also improved as exceptionally strong growth in expenditures for communications equipment more than compensated for fairly soft spending on computers and peripherals and on software.  Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector improved noticeably.  Although spending on nonresidential building construction remained well short of the robust levels seen in late 2000, growth of expenditures in this sector was at its fastest pace in the first quarter in nearly six years.  Outlays on drilling and mining structures continued to climb in the first quarter, and available data pointed to ongoing growth.Real nonfarm inventories stepped down in the first quarter, largely reflecting a decline in investment in motor vehicle inventories.  Excluding motor vehicles, inventories increased at a pace well above that in the fourth quarter.  Over the past twelve months, inventories relative to shipments and sales had moved down moderately on balance, extending the long-run downward trend.The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in February as a sharp decrease in imports more than offset a modest fall in exports.  The declines in both categories were generally widespread across sectors with the exception of oil imports, which were flat, and imported services, which rose.  Incoming data for foreign industrial economies were generally favorable and pointed to continued expansion.  Available data showed continued growth in GDP in the United Kingdom in the first quarter, continuing strong domestic demand in Canada through February, ongoing recovery in Japan, and a first-quarter rebound in euro-area economic performance.Headline inflation turned up in March.  Although the price of natural gas had fallen because of continued plentiful inventories, retail gasoline prices surged, leading to a jump in overall energy prices for the month.  Prices of core goods and services also rose more quickly in March, largely because of a spike in the apparel component that unwound a decline in February and a one-time step-up in medical prices related to changes in Medicare reimbursement rules.  During the twelve months ending in March, overall inflation rose at a slightly faster pace than that in the preceding twelve-month period, while core prices for the same period increased a bit more slowly than in the previous year.  Producer price inflation also moved up in March, driven largely by higher food and energy prices.  Readings on the growth in the cost of labor were mixed.  Over the three months ending in March, the employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose at its slowest pace in several years.  Data on compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, however, pointed toward notably faster growth in the first quarter.  Some financial-market and survey indicators suggested that inflation expectations, both for the upcoming year and for the longer term, had moved up since the March meeting.At its March meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4¾ percent.  In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that the slowing of the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 seemed largely to have reflected temporary or special factors. Economic growth had rebounded strongly in the first quarter but seemed likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.  As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appeared to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains had helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations had remained contained.  Still, the Committee noted that possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, had the potential to add to inflation pressures.  In these circumstances, the Committee judged that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance, but reiterated that in any event the Committee would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.Investors anticipated the FOMC\\'s decision at its March meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points, but the Committee\\'s post-meeting statement evidently led them to mark up somewhat their expected path for the federal funds rate.  Subsequently, the path was pushed up further by data releases that were, on balance, stronger than market participants had expected.  Speeches by Federal Reserve officials, the minutes of the March meeting, and Congressional testimony by the Chairman combined to restrain policy expectations some.  On net, the anticipated path of the federal funds rate over the next two years nonetheless rotated upward.  Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities moved up over the intermeeting period, but yields on nominal Treasury issues rose more.  Spreads of yields on investment-grade bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were about unchanged, while those on speculative-grade bonds declined.  Major stock price indexes were up a bit over the intermeeting period, as positive first-quarter earnings reports more than offset the negative effects of higher energy prices and rising interest rates.The trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar against major foreign currencies fell since the March meeting.  Increased focus in public debate on the risks posed by the large U.S. external imbalance appeared to erode investor support for the dollar.  Domestic nonfinancial sector debt was estimated to have grown at a robust pace in the first quarter, down only slightly from the brisk pace of 2005.  Business sector debt appeared to have expanded strongly, supported by significant net issuance of U.S. corporate bonds and double-digit growth of business loans at commercial banks.  In the household sector, consumer credit continued to rise slowly, and the growth of household mortgage debt was thought, based on limited data, to have moderated somewhat in the first quarter against a backdrop of higher mortgage interest rates and some signs of a deceleration in house prices.  M2 advanced at a pace somewhat below that of nominal GDP in the first quarter and was estimated to have expanded moderately in April.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting showed real GDP growth moderating somewhat from the average pace of the previous several quarters.  The projected deceleration of real GDP reflected the lagged effects of the tightening of monetary policy, the waning impetus from increases in household wealth, and reduced stimulus from fiscal policy.  While higher energy prices were expected to boost inflation in the near term, structural productivity was strong, and the influence of higher energy and material costs was thought likely to moderate.  Thus, consumer prices, after increasing at a faster rate in the first half of the year, were expected to decelerate later this year and next year.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants saw the economy as having rebounded strongly so far this year after the slowing of growth in the fourth quarter.  The advance in output had been vigorous in the first quarter of this year, with real GDP increasing at around a 5 percent annual rate.  Although the expansion appeared likely to moderate, it evidently remained solid.  Inflation pressures appeared to be somewhat greater than the Committee had anticipated at the time of its March meeting.  Consumer prices recently had risen at a pace noticeably above the average rise over the previous twelve months.  Also, prices of energy and many other commodities had climbed sharply of late, and inflation expectations appeared to have risen slightly.  If economic growth continued to moderate over coming quarters, as anticipated, pressures on productive resources would most likely continue to be limited.  Most participants expected that, after allowing for some possible near-term volatility related to the recent jump in energy and other commodity prices, core inflation would probably remain around the levels experienced on average over the past year.  However, recent developments suggested that upside risks to inflation had risen somewhat since the time of the March meeting. In their discussion of major sectors of the economy, some participants noted that growth of household spending was likely to slow over the remainder of the year.  Anecdotal information pointed to some cooling of housing markets.  That cooling was especially noticeable for high-end homes and for houses in markets that previously had experienced the steepest appreciation.  Data on home sales, permits, and starts on the whole likewise suggested that activity was gradually diminishing.  Some reports indicated that speculative building of homes had dropped off considerably, but inventories of unsold homes still seemed to be expanding.  Although fresh comprehensive data were not available, home prices on average appeared still to be rising, but at a slower pace than over the past few years.  Going forward, growth in consumption spending was likely to be supported by gains in employment and personal income.  But slower appreciation of home prices and the effects of the increases in energy prices and interest rates that had already occurred would likely act to restrain consumption spending somewhat.  Certain features of recently popular nontraditional mortgage products had the potential to cause financial difficulties for some households and erode mortgage loan performance for some lenders.  Nonetheless, the household sector seemed likely to remain in sound financial condition overall.  On balance, consumption spending was viewed as most likely to expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters.Several participants remarked that business investment spending was robust.  Nonresidential construction was accelerating notably, in the process absorbing some of the resources that were being diverted from housing.  Office vacancy rates were declining, spurring construction of new office buildings.  Drilling and mining activity was said to be particularly strong, propelled by the high levels of energy prices.  Investment in equipment and software appeared to be expanding at a solid rate.  Capital formation was likely to continue to be supported by rising output, strong balance sheets in the business sector, and ready availability of financing on attractive terms.Some participants commented on the recent surge in federal tax revenues, a development that was being mirrored at the state level.  While the precise reasons for the increase in federal receipts were not entirely clear, robust income growth was probably an important factor.  In any case, the effect was to trim the current federal budget deficit noticeably.  Nonetheless, the longer-run federal fiscal imbalance remained a serious concern.Data on economic growth outside the United States indicated that the global expansion was firming, a sense amplified by reports from international contacts.  The apparent strengthening of global growth was likely to support U.S. exports and economic activity and would also tend to maintain upward pressures on energy and commodity prices.Meeting participants expressed some concern about recent price developments and their implications for inflation prospects.  Core consumer inflation lately had been a little higher than expected.  Moreover, energy prices had risen steeply in the period since the March meeting, and, although pass-through apparently had been limited to date, the most recent increases might be reflected to a greater degree in core inflation in coming months.  Participants noted that prices of non-energy commodities, such as industrial metals and building supplies, also had been climbing.  The recent decline in the dollar was another factor that could add to inflation pressures, although the effect of prior changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on core consumer prices had apparently been limited.  Business contacts had reported continued shortages of certain types of skilled labor and related wage pressures in some occupations, which would tend to boost costs.  However, participants also cited some factors that could be expected to restrain inflation.  Although alternative measures of labor compensation provided divergent readings, growth of total compensation on balance appeared to remain moderate.  And, even if nominal wages should accelerate somewhat, relatively wide profit margins could buffer the effect on prices of final goods and services.  While firms would seek to maintain those margins, recent experience suggested that this might be accomplished in part through further productivity gains, which had remained fairly strong on balance in recent quarters, rather than through more rapid price hikes.Participants discussed in some detail inflation expectations--a potentially important factor influencing future inflation trends.  Some surveys suggested that inflation expectations had risen in recent weeks, but others implied that expectations were little changed.  Measures of inflation compensation based on the difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and inflation-indexed issues had edged higher.  It was possible, though, that investors\\' uncertainty regarding inflation prospects, not just inflation expectations themselves, had risen.  On balance, participants judged that inflation expectations had risen somewhat--a development that would have to be taken into account in policymaking and warranted close monitoring--but remained contained.Although the Committee discussed policy approaches ranging from leaving the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting to increasing the federal funds rate 50 basis points, all members believed that an additional 25 basis point firming of policy was appropriate today to keep inflation from rising and promote sustainable economic expansion.  Recent price developments argued for another firming step at today\\'s meeting.  Core inflation recently had been a bit higher than had been expected, and several members remarked that core inflation was now around the upper end of what they viewed as an acceptable range.  Moreover, a number of factors were augmenting the upside risks to inflation:  the surge in energy and commodity prices, some recent weakness in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, and the possibility that the apparent increase in inflation expectations could, if it persisted, impart momentum to inflation.  In addition, the economy appeared to be operating at a relatively high level of resource utilization and had been growing quite strongly, and whether economic growth would moderate to a sustainable pace was not yet clear.  At the same time, members also saw downside risks to economic activity.  For example, the cumulative effect of past monetary policy actions and the recent rise in longer-term interest rates on housing activity and prices could turn out to be larger than expected.  Still, it seemed most likely that, with modest further policy action, including a 25 basis point firming today, growth in activity would moderate gradually over coming quarters, pressures on resources would remain limited, and core inflation would stay close to levels experienced over the past year.  Given the risks to growth and inflation, Committee members were uncertain about how much, if any, further tightening would be needed after today\\'s action.  In view of the risk that the outlook for inflation could worsen, the Committee decided to repeat the indication in the policy statement released after the March meeting that some further policy firming could be required.  However, the Committee agreed to emphasize that \"the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.\"  Members debated the appropriate characterization of inflation expectations in the statement.  Low and stable inflation expectations were key to the attainment of the Committee\\'s dual objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.  However, the apparent pickup in longer-term expectations, while worrisome, was relatively small.  They remained within the range seen over the past couple of years, and the increase could well reverse before long.  Accordingly, it appeared appropriate to characterize inflation expectations again as \"contained.\"  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 5 percent.\" The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives.\"Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke and Geithner, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Guynn, Kohn, Kroszner, Lacker, and Olson, Ms. Pianalto, Mr. Warsh, and Ms.Yellen.Votes against this action: None. During the interval between the March and May meetings, Chairman Bernanke had appointed a subcommittee on communications issues to be chaired by Governor Kohn and including Presidents Stern and Yellen.  At today\\'s meeting, Governor Kohn indicated that the objective of the subcommittee was to help the Committee frame and organize discussion of a broad range of such issues over coming meetings.The meeting adjourned at 1:10 p.m.Notation VoteBy notation vote completed on April 17, 2006, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting held on March 27-28, 2006.

The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.  The information reviewed at the June meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity in the second quarter slowed substantially from its rapid first-quarter pace.  The expansion of consumer spending softened, and activity in the housing market continued to cool.  In contrast, the underlying rate of business spending remained strong and was well supported by fundamentals.  The demand for labor appeared to moderate as hiring stepped down in recent months.  Consumer price inflation remained elevated in April and May, reflecting sharp rises in energy prices and more rapid increases in core prices.Gains in nonfarm private payrolls averaged 112,000 over the three months ending in May, a pace considerably below the average of about 170,000 jobs per month for the prior three-month period.  The slowing in hiring was most pronounced in retail trade but was also evident in construction and information services.  Establishments in professional and business services, nonbusiness services, and wholesale trade continued to add jobs at roughly the same pace as earlier in the year.  Average hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls edged up in April but reversed these gains in May.  The unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in May, near its average for the year so far.   Industrial production edged down in May after strong growth in April, largely reflecting the patterns of manufacturing output.  For the year to date, manufacturing production advanced at a rate significantly below its rapid fourth-quarter growth rate but only a bit below its average pace of expansion since mid-2003.  The mining sector, which includes oil and natural gas extraction, expanded solidly in April before falling back in May.  Utilities output also grew strongly in April but retreated in May as temperatures returned to normal after having been unseasonably warm in April.  Capacity utilization in manufacturing remained somewhat above its long-run average in both April and May.  Real consumer spending appeared to be on track to decelerate noticeably in the current quarter after posting robust growth in the first quarter.  The slowing reflected both a marked reduction in the growth in real outlays for motor vehicles from an elevated first-quarter pace and a moderation in the advance of real expenditures for other goods in recent months.  Underlying this slowing in the expansion of consumer expenditures was a moderation in the fundamental determinants of spending.  The level of nominal wages and salaries beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005 was revised down considerably, and rising consumer prices held down the gains in real disposable income.  Higher interest rates also likely restrained spending.  Nonetheless, despite recent declines in equity prices, the wealth-to-income ratio remained well above its historical average, and consumer sentiment, which dipped in May, rebounded some in early June.  Residential construction activity moderated over the past few months but remained at a historically high level.  Single-family starts posted a sizable drop in May for the third consecutive month.  Although a substantial portion of May\\'s decline seemed to be a partial payback for the elevated level of starts early in the year, when weather conditions had been favorable, the underlying pace of single-family housing construction appeared to have slowed.  In the multifamily sector, starts in May were well within the typical range seen since 1995.  Sales of both new and existing single-family homes in April and May were significantly below their peaks of the summer of 2005, though new home sales continued to regain some ground after having fallen in February.  The most reliable measures of house prices indicated modest growth following the rapid increases seen last year.   After a first-quarter surge, real spending on equipment and software appeared on track for a much smaller gain in the second quarter.  Incoming data for the current quarter suggested that spending on transportation equipment reversed the run-up that occurred in the first quarter.  Spending on high-tech equipment and software advanced at a slower pace in the second quarter as a flattening out of spending on communications equipment after a huge increase in the first quarter offset some pickup in business-sector demand for computers and software.  The construction of nonresidential buildings picked up noticeably so far this year, although activity remained well short of its previous peak in mid-2000.  Outlays on drilling and mining structures continued to climb in response to high projected energy prices.  The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles stepped up in April.  The ratio of book-value inventories to sales held steady for the year so far after having fallen considerably last year.  In general, inventories appeared to be well aligned with demand, and business surveys suggested that firms were comfortable with the level of inventories. The U.S. international trade deficit widened in April, reflecting a large increase in imports coupled with a slight decline in exports.  Import growth was led by sharp rises in the value of imported oil and natural gas and increased imports of automotive products and capital goods.  Exports were restrained in part by a decline in aircraft exports.  Expansion of economic activity in the foreign industrial countries was solid in the first quarter, but indications for the second quarter were more mixed.  Incoming data pointed to a possible slowing in Canada, but signs of further expansion in the euro area and of continued growth in Japan were evident, notwithstanding sharp declines in equity indexes in these countries.   Headline inflation picked up in April and May, driven partly by sharp increases in the prices of petroleum-based products.  In contrast, natural gas prices continued to decline in response to excess supply, fully reversing last autumn\\'s rises.  Higher oil prices showed through to producer prices for a variety of energy-intensive intermediate goods.  Consumer food prices decelerated markedly since January, reflecting slower price increases for food away from home and declines, on balance, in the prices of fruits and vegetables.  Core price inflation rose less than headline inflation in April and May but above its pace earlier in the year.  Core prices were boosted in part by an acceleration in shelter costs, especially those imputed for owner-occupied residences.  Readings on the growth of labor costs were revised down for the fourth quarter of 2005 and first quarter of 2006, but recent data suggested a pickup in the second quarter.  A number of indicators of inflation expectations largely reversed increases recorded in the spring.  At its May meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 5 percent.  The Committee\\'s accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been quite strong so far this year.  The Committee saw growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.  At that time, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appeared to have had only a modest effect on core inflation.  Ongoing productivity gains had helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remained contained.  Still, possible increases in resource utilization and the elevated prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to add to inflation pressures.  In these circumstances, the Committee foresaw the possibility of a need for some further policy firming to address inflation risks but emphasized that the extent and timing of any such firming would depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.  Investors anticipated the FOMC\\'s decision at its May meeting to raise the federal funds rate target 25 basis points, but near-term policy expectations edged up, apparently in response to the accompanying statement.  Subsequent data releases reporting higher-than-expected inflation, the release of the FOMC minutes, and speeches by Federal Reserve policymakers all led investors to push up their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate.  Yields on near-term nominal Treasury securities rose in line with policy expectations over the intermeeting period, but those on longer-dated securities moved up by smaller amounts.  Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities increased by more than those on nominal securities, and the resulting decline in inflation compensation retraced a substantial share of the rise that had occurred over the preceding intermeeting period.  Major stock price indexes fell sharply over the period.  Spreads of yields on corporate bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened somewhat, while those on speculative-grade issues rose by more.  After changing little on balance during much of May, the dollar\\'s foreign exchange value against other major currencies moved up in June and showed a modest increase, on net, over the intermeeting period. The dollar appreciated after comments by FOMC policymakers that were interpreted by market participants as suggesting a higher likelihood of policy tightening at the June FOMC meeting.  Prices of precious and industrial metals, which had risen sharply since early March, particularly in May, reversed those gains later in the intermeeting period.  Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors was estimated to have decelerated in the second quarter after a robust first-quarter increase.  Business sector debt advanced more slowly in the second quarter, although the expansion of business loans remained brisk and net issuance of corporate bonds was solid.  In the household sector, mortgage borrowing slowed in response to more subdued housing activity and moderating house-price appreciation.  M2 growth in the second quarter was tepid, as the growth of nominal income had apparently softened and rising opportunity cost continued to dampen demand for money.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that, after the significant deceleration of real GDP in the current quarter from the first quarter of 2006, growth would proceed through the end of 2007 at a pace a bit below the rate of growth of the economy\\'s potential.  The outlook for modest growth of real GDP reflected a slowdown in the housing market, the effects of past policy tightening, and a diminished boost to consumer spending from increases in household wealth.  Core consumer price inflation was projected to have stepped up in the second quarter from its average pace over the preceding several quarters but to then drop back somewhat, albeit to a level higher than previously forecasted, as energy and import prices flatten out and some slack emerges in labor and product markets.  In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants saw economic growth as having moderated in the second quarter from its robust pace in the first quarter, reflecting a cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.  Most participants expected output to advance over the next year and a half at a pace close to that which the economy can sustain over time.  All participants found the elevated readings on core inflation of recent months to be of concern and, if sustained, inconsistent with the maintenance of price stability.  However, contained inflation expectations, the abatement of upward pressure from past increases in energy and other commodity prices, and the slowing in the growth of economic activity that was under way were expected to contribute to a moderation in core inflation in coming quarters.  Nonetheless, participants noted a risk that the drop-back in inflation could be slower or more limited than the Committee would find desirable since resource utilization was currently tight and the pickup in price increases had been broadly based rather than being limited to a few specific sectors that could be linked to energy costs.  In preparation for the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual report to the Congress on monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for 2006 and 2007, conditioned on the participants\\' views of the appropriate path for monetary policy.  The forecasts of the rate of fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter expansion in real GDP for 2006 were in a range of 3 to 3-3/4 percent, with a central tendency of 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent, and those for 2007 were in a range of 2-1/2 to 3-1/4 percent, with a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 percent.  These rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate in a range of 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007, with a central tendency at both horizons of 4-3/4 to 5 percent.  Forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the change in the average fourth-quarter core PCE price index from a year earlier, ranged from 2-1/4 to 3 percent for this year, with a central tendency of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, and the range and central tendency were 2 to 2-1/4 percent for next year.  In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy, participants observed that housing construction activity had declined notably in recent months as indicated by lower housing starts and permits; moreover, higher inventories of unsold homes, a sharp rise in cancellations of new home sales, and reports from construction companies suggested that the weakness was likely to be extended.  Several participants pointed out that the decline was broadly in line with expectations in light of the tightening in monetary policy and the rapid run-up in home prices and residential construction in recent years.  Participants also observed that the evidence to date indicated that the slowdown was orderly but were mindful of the possibility of a sharper downturn in the sector. The growth of consumer spending had dropped off significantly in the second quarter from a robust pace earlier in the year.  The slowdown was attributed in part to higher energy prices and also to a likely downshift in home price appreciation and higher interest rates.  A reduction in the attractiveness of home equity borrowing was mentioned as possibly contributing to the slowdown.  Some retailers, especially those catering to lower- and middle-income customers, reported weaker growth in sales.  Consumer spending was expected to advance modestly in coming quarters as the effects of more moderate gains in home prices and a gradual rebound in the household saving rate from recent historically low levels were offset by further gains in employment and growth in labor income.  A few participants noted that the surge in federal tax receipts this year and a similar advance in revenue at the state level could be a sign of vigorous gains in income, indicating that household spending may expand more rapidly than many were anticipating.  Participants interpreted the incoming data on orders and shipments of durable goods, positive readings on business sentiment, and continued high levels of corporate profitability as suggesting that business investment would remain a source of strength going forward.  In a shift from the pattern observed in the past few years, some contacts suggested that businesses were now directing their capital expenditures toward expanding capacity rather than increasing efficiency, a signal of the anticipation of continued solid growth in demand.  Business expenditures on nonresidential structures also were seen to be advancing robustly in a number of markets, possibly providing some offset to reduced residential construction activity.  Several participants observed that the continued ready availability of credit would support business expenditures.  Others, however, noted that the pullback from risk-taking that had been observed in some financial markets over the preceding few months could intensify, raising the cost of funds.  Participants observed that many foreign central banks had tightened monetary policy over the intermeeting period in response to strengthening activity and indications of inflation pressures.  Greater uncertainty about inflation pressures and the needed policy response had perhaps contributed to a reassessment of risks by investors globally.  Despite the tighter policy, however, economic growth in the United States\\' major trading partners appeared likely to remain solid, supporting U.S. exports.  Participants also discussed the role of global capacity utilization in the inflation process.  All meeting participants expressed concern about recent elevated readings on core inflation.  A key issue was the extent to which this spring\\'s increase in inflation reflected transitory or persistent influences.  Many noted that a number of factors were temporarily boosting inflation.  The pass-through of the substantial rise in energy prices could account for a considerable part of the step-up in core inflation in recent quarters.  In addition, rising rents had been boosting the cost of shelter and so contributing to the increase in core inflation.  However, energy prices were expected to level out, and rents, while difficult to forecast, were viewed by some participants as likely to decelerate in coming quarters.  The moderation in the economic expansion was expected to prevent pressures on resource utilization from intensifying.  In sum, with inflation expectations contained and unit labor costs held down by ongoing gains in productivity and modest advances in compensation, inflation was seen by most participants as likely to edge down.    Nevertheless, several factors were cited as potentially sustaining upward pressure on inflation, and the range of participants\\' forecasts for core inflation in 2007 rose by 1/4 percentage point relative to the range of forecasts made in February.  Some participants noted that businesses in their Districts were experiencing difficulty hiring certain types of skilled workers, suggesting that increased wage pressures might emerge.  In addition, some business contacts indicated a greater ability to pass higher costs on to customers, although other businesses continued to report that their pricing power remained limited.  The relatively taut resource markets and the lagged effects of the increase in energy prices raised the possibility that inflation could continue at somewhat elevated levels for some time.  Higher levels of inflation, should they persist, could become embedded in inflation expectations.  In that vein, several participants noted that inflation expectations had been sensitive to incoming data and to communications regarding monetary policy over the intermeeting period.All Committee members agreed that raising the target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 5-1/4 percent, at this meeting was appropriate given the recent readings on inflation and the associated deterioration in the inflation outlook.  Such an action would also help preserve the decline in inflation expectations that had occurred over the intermeeting period and which appeared to be conditioned on an outlook for a policy firming.  Characterizing the resulting stance of policy was quite difficult in the view of most members; those who did venture a judgment saw the stance as ranging from modestly restrictive to somewhat accommodative.  Many members noted that significant uncertainty accompanied the appropriate setting of policy going forward, and one indicated that the decision to raise the target federal funds rate at this meeting was a close call.  In their discussion of the wording of the statement to be released after the meeting, members expressed a wide range of views.  Some members favored a shorter statement that focused on the Committee\\'s desire to see core inflation decline from its recent elevated levels, while others were inclined to provide more information about the forces that would likely influence the future path of policy.  In light of the possibility that the lessening of inflation pressures could be more limited than consistent with sustained good performance of the economy, members agreed to indicate that \"[a]lthough the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time . . . some inflation risks remain.\"  Nevertheless, with the economy slowing and some of the effects of past tightening still in the pipeline, members recognized the value of accumulating more information for determining what, if any, additional policy action would be needed following the tightening adopted at the current meeting.  To indicate that policy action at future meetings was not foreordained and would depend on the forecasts for inflation and activity in the medium term, the Committee agreed to state that \"[t]he extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\"  After consulting with the participants, the communications subcommittee recommended that the Committee begin its discussions of communications issues at the FOMC meeting in August and that the FOMC meetings scheduled for later this year be lengthened to allow a fuller initial discussion of some of these issues.  The Committee also discussed briefly the schedule for FOMC meetings next year and tentatively agreed to increase the number of two-day meetings to four.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 5-1/4 percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\"Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives.\"Votes for this action:  Messrs. Bernanke and Geithner, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Guynn, Kohn, Kroszner, and Lacker,  Ms. Pianalto, Mr. Warsh, and Ms.Yellen.Votes against this action:  None.The meeting adjourned at 11:10 a.m. Notation VoteBy notation vote completed on May 30, 2006, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting held on May 10, 2006.

Peach and Krane, and Ms. Weir, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks ofNew York, Chicago, and New York, respectivelyMr. Weber, Senior Research Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of MinneapolisMr. Hetzel, Senior Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of RichmondThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\x92s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at the meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity in the second quarter slowed from its rapid pace in the first quarter.  Residential investment contracted as activity in the housing market continued to cool.  Consumer spending and business investment decelerated after posting substantial increases in the first quarter.  The demand for labor moderated, with hiring in recent months below the pace of earlier this year.  Consumer price inflation remained elevated in July, reflecting further increases in energy prices and shelter costs.Nonfarm payrolls increased in June and July, but more slowly than in the first quarter.  The moderation in hiring was most pronounced in retail trade but was also evident in construction and non-business services.  Establishments in professional and business services continued to add jobs at roughly the same pace as that of earlier in the year.  Average hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls edged up.  The unemployment rate rose to 4.8 percent in July, above its average over the first half of the year. Industrial production picked up in June.  For the second quarter as a whole, it grew at a robust rate that was faster than its first-quarter pace.  Gains in manufacturing production were widespread across industries.  The mining sector, which includes oil and natural gas extraction, expanded solidly in June, although average growth in the second quarter was below that of the first quarter, in part because the recovery from the disruptions caused by last year\\x92s hurricanes neared completion.  Utilities output grew strongly in the second quarter.  The rate of capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector stepped up in June and remained above its long-run average. The growth of consumer spending slowed considerably in the second quarter after the surge in purchases around the turn of the year.  Spending on goods excluding motor vehicles posted a modest increase in June after remaining flat, on average, over the previous four months.  Although nominal wages and salaries rose briskly in the first half of the year, gains in real disposable income were held down by rising consumer prices.  While past gains in household wealth, particularly from home prices, supported consumer spending, higher interest rates and energy prices were likely a restraining influence.  Indicators of consumer sentiment for July were mixed.Residential construction activity contracted in the second quarter.  Single-family starts declined in June to a level well below the average of the previous twelve months.  Construction in the multifamily sector remained steady, with starts in June well within the typical range seen since 1995.  Sales of both new and existing single-family homes slowed in June and were significantly below their peaks of the summer of 2005.  Available measures of house prices indicated that price increases had moderated over the past four quarters. After surging in the first quarter, real spending on equipment and software edged down in the second quarter.  The decline was accounted for primarily by a drop in expenditures on communications and transportation equipment.  Spending on high-tech equipment and software declined as well.  The construction of nonresidential buildings moved up at a solid pace over the first half of the year, although activity remained well short of its previous peak in mid-2000.  Outlays on drilling and mining structures continued to climb in response to high energy prices, and spending on office construction edged up as vacancy rates continued to trend down.  Overall, economic fundamentals and business sentiment continued to support increased investment.The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles rose in May, and real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles appeared to be slightly higher in the second quarter than earlier in the year.  The ratio of book-value inventories to sales edged down in May in both the trade and manufacturing sectors after having remained relatively steady over the previous three months.  In the manufacturing sector, however, inventories ticked up again in June.  In general, inventories appeared to be well aligned with demand, and business surveys suggested that firms were comfortable with the level of inventories. The U.S. international trade deficit widened in May, reflecting a sharp increase in imports that more than offset a sizable gain in exports.  Import growth was heavily concentrated in oil, reflecting both higher prices and quantities; other categories of imports fell on balance.  Exports rose across almost all major product categories; the largest gains were in consumer goods and capital goods, especially aircraft.  Expansion of economic activity in the advanced foreign economies appeared to continue in the second quarter at a pace roughly comparable to that of the first quarter, on net.  Incoming data for the second quarter pointed to a pickup in economic growth in the euro area and Japan but indicated that growth slowed somewhat in Canada.  Recent economic indicators from the developing economies were mixed but, in general, suggested some moderation in growth from the rapid first-quarter pace.Headline inflation continued to move up, on balance, in recent months, and consumer prices increased at a faster pace in the second quarter than over the previous twelve months.  Consumer energy prices, while declining slightly in June, surged during the second quarter, on net.  Core consumer prices also continued to rise, boosted by an acceleration in shelter costs, particularly those for owner-occupied residences, and some pass-through of energy cost increases.  Higher oil prices showed through in producer prices for a variety of energy-intensive intermediate goods.  Rising import prices, higher domestic rates of capacity utilization, and strong global demand for materials were factors underlying an acceleration in core prices for intermediate materials.  The price of crude oil increased further over the intermeeting period, and strong weather-related demand caused the price of natural gas to rise considerably.  The employment cost index rose somewhat faster in the second quarter than over the preceding three months, but the twelve-month change was less than that of a year ago.  Survey measures of households\\x92 inflation expectations in June and July reversed their increases in April and May.At its June meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 5¼ percent.  The Committee\\'s accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been moderating from its quite strong pace earlier in the year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.  Readings on core inflation had been elevated in recent months, but ongoing productivity gains had held down the rise in unit labor costs, and inflation expectations remained contained.  However, high levels of resource utilization and the high prices for energy and other commodities had the potential to sustain inflation pressures.  Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand would help limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained.  The extent and timing of any additional firming would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information. Investors anticipated the FOMC\\'s decision at its June meeting to raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points, but near-term policy expectations edged lower, apparently in response to the accompanying statement.  Subsequently, data releases on real activity that were weaker than expected, the Chairman\\x92s testimony on the semiannual Monetary Policy Report, and the release of the June FOMC minutes all led investors to revise down their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate.  Yields on nominal Treasury securities fell in line with policy expectations over the intermeeting period.  Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities declined a bit more than those on comparable nominal Treasury securities, leaving inflation compensation up slightly, albeit within recent ranges.  Spreads of yields on corporate bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were about unchanged, while those on speculative-grade bonds widened.  Major stock price indexes rose modestly.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies fell, on net, over the intermeeting period. Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors was estimated to have decelerated in the second quarter after a robust first-quarter increase.  Business-sector debt increased briskly, as the expansion of business loans remained robust.  In the household sector, mortgage debt decelerated from the first quarter\\x92s rapid pace in response to higher mortgage rates and slower house-price appreciation.  M2 growth dropped in the second quarter and remained modest in July, consistent with moderating growth of nominal income and rising opportunity cost.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that real GDP growth would slow in the second half of 2006 and 2007, and to a lower rate than had been anticipated in the prior forecast.  The marking down of the outlook was largely attributable to the annual revision of the national income and product accounts, which involved downward revisions to actual GDP growth in prior years and prompted reductions in the staff\\x92s estimate of potential output.  The slowdown in the housing market, the effects of higher energy prices on household purchasing power, the waning impetus of household wealth effects on consumer spending, and the effects of past policy tightening were expected to hold economic growth below potential over the next six quarters.  Core consumer price inflation was projected to drop back somewhat later this year and next, mainly as the effects of higher energy and import prices abated.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that the slowing of GDP growth in the second quarter was generally in line with expectations, reflecting the continued cooling of the housing market, the restraining influence on demand of higher energy prices, and the lagged effects of past increases in interest rates.  Going forward, output was expected to advance at a pace at or slightly below the economy\\x92s potential rate of growth, but several participants noted that the annual revision to the national income and product accounts suggested this growth rate likely was lower than previously believed.  Incoming information with regard to inflation had not been encouraging.  Still, most participants thought that, with energy prices possibly leveling out, aggregate demand moderating, and long-term inflation expectations contained, core PCE inflation likely would decline gradually from its recent elevated level, though the upside risks to inflation were significant.In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy, participants noted that residential construction activity had continued to recede over the past few months and cited the housing sector as a downside risk to the outlook for growth.  The rate of new home sale cancellations, which was identified as an important leading indicator by some contacts in the construction industry, had spiked higher.  Single-family housing starts and permits continued to fall, and inventories of unsold housing appeared to have risen significantly, pointing to continued slowing in this sector.  Some participants observed that the slowing seemed to be orderly thus far, but it was also noted that in some areas of the country housing construction had experienced a relatively sharp fall.  In general, participants expressed considerable uncertainty regarding prospects for the housing sector.Meeting participants noted that the continued increases in energy prices and borrowing costs appeared to have restrained consumer spending growth in recent months.  Contacts in the retail sector generally reported a continued slowing of growth in sales, although the situation differed somewhat by region and type of good or service.  Reliable, comprehensive data were not yet available on recent house price movements, but the rate of appreciation appeared to be moderating and was likely to slow further in coming months.  The slower pace of increase in housing wealth would restrain consumption growth, though by how much was uncertain.  However, the financial condition of households, as judged by indicators such as bankruptcy filings and loan delinquencies, appeared to remain solid.  Overall, consumption spending seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters.Although business fixed investment in the second quarter was a little lower than had been expected, participants noted that this development appeared mainly to reflect the timing of purchases, particularly of transportation equipment, and not weakness in the underlying trend.  Some participants noted that nonresidential construction had continued to strengthen, offsetting some of the contraction in residential construction.  Looking forward, strong business balance sheets and high profitability were seen as supporting continued growth in expenditures on software and equipment.  However, it was noted that if the reported slowing of increases in retail sales continued, businesses might trim capital spending plans.With regard to the federal sector, spending related to last year\\x92s hurricanes appeared likely to abate, and federal expenditures overall would probably be providing less impetus to aggregate demand going forward.  Federal receipts had been increasing rapidly, a development that reflected continued strong growth in labor and non-labor income.Some participants noted that global demand remained strong, potentially adding to worldwide pressures on resources.  Increased geopolitical risks, particularly related to developments in the Middle East, continued to put pressure on energy prices, and the prices of many other commodities also had firmed over the intermeeting period.  Central banks had been raising interest rates globally, however, and this was viewed as a factor that should help to restrain global inflation pressures.  But it was also noted that the recent decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar could lead to a weakening of import competition in the form of increases in the prices of tradable goods in the United States.As at the June meeting, all participants expressed concern about continued elevated readings on core inflation and inflation risks going forward.  Several participants took note of the revisions to historical data that painted a more worrisome picture of cost trends; measures of unit labor costs had been marked up, reflecting upward revisions to labor compensation and downward revisions to labor productivity.  Core PCE inflation now appeared to have been running at or above a 2 percent annual rate for more than two years, with prices accelerating over the first half of 2006.  Many participants noted that the extent to which the increase in core inflation so far this year reflected transitory or persistent influences remained unclear.  The recent pickup in price increases appeared to be broad-based, and a number of business contacts reported greater ability to pass through higher costs.  However, some types of price pressures were not likely to continue to increase.  The recent acceleration in shelter costs, which contributed substantially to the increase in core inflation this year, could prove short-lived.  Moreover, while energy prices had risen further in the intermeeting period, energy prices could well level out in coming quarters.  Also, the anticipated moderation in aggregate demand implied that pressures on resource utilization likely would not increase and could abate to a degree going forward.   Finally, inflation expectations appeared to have remained contained despite adverse news about prices.  In light of these factors, most participants expressed the view that core inflation was likely to decline gradually over the next several quarters, although appreciable upside risks remained.In the Committee\\x92s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, nearly all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting.  In view of the elevated readings on costs and prices, many members thought that the decision to keep policy unchanged at this meeting was a close call and noted that additional firming could well be needed.  But with economic growth having moderated some, most members anticipated that inflation pressures quite possibly would ease gradually over coming quarters and the current stance of policy could well prove to be consistent with satisfactory economic performance.  Under these circumstances, keeping policy unchanged at this meeting would allow the Committee to accumulate more information before judging whether additional firming would be necessary to foster the attainment of price stability over time.  The full effect of previous increases in interest rates on activity and prices probably had not yet been felt, and a pause was viewed as appropriate to limit the risks of tightening too much.  Following seventeen consecutive policy firming actions, members generally saw limited risk in deferring further policy tightening that might prove necessary, as long as inflation expectations remained contained.All members agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should convey that inflation risks remained dominant and that consequently keeping policy unchanged at this meeting did not necessarily mark the end of the tightening cycle.  They concurred that an indication that economic growth had moderated was appropriate, and a consensus favored citing the same reasons for that moderation as in the June statement.  Members also agreed that the statement should both mention factors contributing to the likely moderation of inflation pressures over time and reiterate the forces that were seen as having the potential to sustain inflation pressures.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/4 percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p.m.:\"The Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\"Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke and Geithner, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Guynn, Kohn, Kroszner, Ms. Pianalto, Mr. Warsh, and Ms.Yellen.Votes against this action:  Mr. Lacker.Mr. Lacker dissented because he believed that further tightening was needed to bring inflation down more rapidly than would be the case if the policy rate were kept unchanged.  The inflation outlook had deteriorated in the intermeeting period; the recent surge in core inflation had persisted and appeared to be broad-based, while the revision of the national income and product accounts indicated a recent upswing in compensation and unit labor costs.  Although real growth was likely to be somewhat lower in coming quarters, in his view it was unlikely to moderate by enough to bring core inflation down.  He noted, moreover, that real short-term interest rates had fallen in the intermeeting period and were still low relative to rates typically associated with sustained expansions.The Committee then turned to a discussion of the goals and principles that should guide the review of its approaches to policy communications that it had recently undertaken.  Participants agreed that communication was important for democratic accountability and could promote the effectiveness of policy.  Although considerable strides had been made in FOMC communications over the past ten years or so, participants generally thought that further advances were possible.  In that regard, consideration of how the Committee expressed both its economic objectives and its assessments of expected progress toward those objectives was likely to be particularly important.  Conveying the degree of uncertainty and conditionality about Committee expectations of future developments was seen as a major challenge.  It was recognized that communications should support appropriate decisionmaking, including respect for the diversity of views that contributed to good decisions.  Participants agreed to continue the Committee\\x92s review of communications issues at the FOMC meeting in October.The meeting adjourned at 3:05 p.m. Notation VoteBy notation vote completed on July 19, 2006, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on June 28-29, 2006.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at the meeting suggested that economic activity continued to decelerate in recent months.  Consumer and business spending held up well, and payroll employment continued to rise moderately in July and August.  However, a contraction in homebuilding was damping the economic expansion.  Core consumer price inflation eased somewhat but nonetheless remained higher than it was in 2005.  Total consumer price inflation moderated in August, reflecting a substantial slowing of the increase in energy prices.Nonfarm payrolls rose in August at a pace similar to that recorded over the previous four months.  Employment gains were widespread in the service sector, and the construction industry also added jobs, particularly in nonresidential building.  However, employment in retail trade and manufacturing fell again in August.  Average hours of production or nonsupervisory workers edged lower.  The unemployment rate ticked back down to 4.7 percent in August, but it remained within the narrow band that prevailed since the beginning of the year.Industrial production rose in July but edged down in August.  Manufacturing output was unchanged in August, as a small increase in the production of motor vehicles and parts was offset by a slight net decline in other sectors.  Output of construction supplies, for example, dropped a little.  In the high-technology sector, the production of computers rose tepidly through the summer, while output of communications equipment turned down in August after increasing markedly during the first half of the year.  Semiconductor production remained sluggish through August.Consumer spending appeared to be rising at a moderate pace in recent months.  Spending on cars and light trucks increased somewhat in July after a lackluster pace in the second quarter but apparently weakened in August.  Consumer spending on goods excluding motor vehicles increased modestly during the four months ending in July.  Despite the sharp net increase in energy prices, real disposable income rose further, with solid gains in June and July.  Increases in household wealth earlier in the year continued to boost consumer spending.  However, consumer borrowing costs had risen since the beginning of the year with the increase in short-term interest rates.  Recent readings on consumer sentiment were mixed.  The personal saving rate fell further in July.Residential construction activity continued to contract in recent months.  Single-family starts fell further in July and August to a level well below the peak in the third quarter of 2005.  Construction in the multifamily sector also fell back.  Sales of both new and existing single-family homes fell in July and were significantly below the peaks of last summer.  A range of indicators suggested that housing market activity was likely to slow further in the near term.  Pending home sales dropped noticeably in July, and mortgage rates had increased since the beginning of the year.  Available measures suggested that prices of existing homes increased through the second quarter at a much lower rate than the one observed during the same period last year.After strong increases in the first half of 2006, real spending on equipment and software remained robust into the summer against a backdrop of rising business output, plentiful corporate cash reserves, positive sentiment among executives, and falling relative prices for high-tech equipment.  Orders and shipments of communications equipment leveled off in recent months after climbing earlier this year.  Real computer spending remained sluggish in July.  Business purchases of light vehicles picked up in August after a weak performance in July, and sales of medium and heavy trucks remained brisk.  Available data indicated that aircraft purchases remained flat.  Real spending on equipment outside the high-tech and transportation sectors appeared to be increasing moderately in the current quarter.Book-value data for the manufacturing and trade sectors suggested that inventory accumulation slowed only modestly in July from a brisk pace in the second quarter.  Outside the motor vehicle sector, inventories appeared to be well aligned with demand, and surveys indicated that firms continued to be generally comfortable with their level of inventories.Both imports and exports increased in the second quarter, but imports increased and exports decreased in July, widening the U.S. trade deficit.  The growth of imports was heavily concentrated in oil, reflecting higher petroleum prices, and in non-oil industrial supplies and capital goods.  Imports of services fell slightly.  Exports of capital goods and industrial supplies declined after considerable gains in June, but exports of telecommunications equipment and automotive products were strong.  Exports of services were unchanged in July.Economic activity in the advanced foreign economies decelerated in the second quarter but remained strong.  A fall in net exports held back expansion in Japan and Canada, while strong domestic demand boosted growth in the United Kingdom and the euro area.  Incoming data suggested that overall GDP growth in these countries for the current quarter was dropping a bit from the second-quarter pace.  Recent economic indicators from the emerging-market economies generally pointed to robust, but moderating, growth.The overall price index for personal consumption expenditures rose relatively steeply in July and was estimated to have increased further in August, bringing the advance over the twelve-month period above the year-earlier rise.  After July, though, crude oil and gasoline prices dropped back significantly, and with inventories of natural gas remaining near seasonal highs, natural gas prices fell from their spike earlier this summer.  Core consumer prices increased at a somewhat more subdued pace over July and August, but despite the recent moderation, the twelve-month change in core prices remained above the increase over the comparable period twelve months earlier.  The producer price index for core intermediate materials rose significantly in July and August.  Substantial upward revisions to wages and salaries boosted compensation per hour in the first quarter.  The increase likely owed in part to the exercise of stock options and cash bonuses; other data that did not include such forms of compensation pointed to more moderate increases.  Hourly compensation rose further in the second quarter and recorded an increase of about 7-3/4 percent from four quarters earlier.  After more favorable readings in June and July, survey measures of households\\' inflation expectations turned back up in August, but preliminary September readings suggested a decline.At its August meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to maintain its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  The Committee\\'s accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had moderated from its quite strong pace earlier in the year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.  Readings on core inflation had been elevated in recent months, and the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to sustain inflation pressures.  However, inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, reflecting contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions, as well as reduced impetus from higher energy and materials costs.  Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Investors had largely anticipated the FOMC\\'s decision at its August meeting to maintain the federal funds rate at its current level, and short-term rates dropped only a bit in response.  Subsequently, data on inflation that were weaker than expected, substantial declines in oil prices, and the release of the minutes of the August FOMC meeting led investors to revise down their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate.  Over the intermeeting period, yields on short- and intermediate-term nominal Treasury securities fell, while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities of comparable maturity increased somewhat, pushing inflation compensation considerably lower at those horizons.  Nominal forward rates further out the yield curve fell about the same amount as real forward rates, implying little change in far-forward inflation compensation.  Spreads of yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds over those on Treasury securities were about unchanged.  Major stock price indexes posted solid gains.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors in the third quarter was estimated to be rising at about the same pace as in second quarter.  Business-sector debt was increasing briskly, as the expansion of business loans remained robust.  In the household sector, debt expanded in the second quarter at a rate slightly below that in the first quarter, as mortgage debt decelerated somewhat.  M2 growth remained modest in August, consistent with moderating growth of nominal income and lagged increases in opportunity cost.The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that real GDP growth would continue to slow into the second half of 2006 before strengthening gradually thereafter.  By 2008, output was projected to be expanding at a pace about equal to the staff\\'s forecast of potential output growth.  The staff, however, had again reduced its projection for potential GDP growth, and the projected slow pace of growth over the next several quarters was thus consistent with an opening of only a small gap in resource utilization.  In the near term, the cooling of the housing market and lower motor vehicle production were expected to hold growth back.  At the same time, though, significantly lower energy prices, sustained increases in labor income, and favorable labor market conditions were anticipated to support expansion through the end of the year.  Further ahead, the lagged effects of the previous tightening of monetary policy and waning stimulus from household wealth and fiscal policy were anticipated to restrain growth, but the drag from the downturn in residential construction was expected to abate.  Core consumer price inflation was projected to drop back somewhat later this year and next, reflecting the emergence of slack in the economy and lower energy costs.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that the pace of the expansion appeared to be continuing to moderate in the third quarter.  In particular, activity in the housing market seemed to be cooling considerably, which would contribute to relatively subdued growth over the balance of the year.  Growth was likely to strengthen next year as the housing correction abated, with activity also encouraged by the recent decline in energy prices and still-supportive financial conditions.  In the view of many participants, economic expansion would probably track close to the rate of growth of the economy\\'s potential next year and in 2008.  Many participants also noted that core inflation had been running at an undesirably high rate.  Although most participants expected core inflation to decline gradually, substantial uncertainty attended this outlook.In their discussion of major sectors of the economy, meeting participants focused especially on developments in the housing market.  Although the situation varied somewhat across the nation, housing activity was continuing to contract in most regions.  Home sales had slowed considerably, and anecdotal reports suggested that more buyers were canceling contracts for purchases.  Participants noted that inventories of unsold homes had climbed sharply in many areas and that builders were taking a number of measures to reduce inventories.  Both permits for new construction and housing starts had declined significantly.  Available measures of home prices suggested that appreciation had slowed considerably but prices in most areas were not falling, although some sellers were reported to be providing various inducements to potential purchasers that reduced effective prices.Thus far, the drop in housing market activity appeared not to have spilled over significantly to other sectors of the economy.  Indeed, consumer expenditures appeared to have been expanding moderately over the previous few months, buoyed by increases in employment, personal income, and household wealth.  Contacts in some Districts reported that retail sales had picked up a little most recently.  Meeting participants noted that consumer spending going forward would be supported by the higher levels of personal income indicated by recent revisions to the national income and product accounts, by further gains in employment, and by the decline in consumer energy prices over recent months.  However, considerable uncertainty was expressed regarding the ultimate extent of the downturn in the housing sector and the degree to which the slowing in housing activity and the deceleration in home prices would affect consumption and other expenditures going forward.Business investment spending generally was seen as expanding at a reasonably good pace.  Meeting participants noted broad strength in manufacturing of capital goods.  Nonresidential construction activity continued to strengthen, and in the process was absorbing some of the resources that were no longer employed in homebuilding.  Although some survey evidence suggested that some firms were trimming capital spending plans, participants reported that their business contacts generally were quite positive about the economic outlook and the strength of demand for their products.  In this environment, investment spending would likely continue to be supported by expansion of overall output, strong balance sheets and profits, and the ready availability of funding from financial markets and institutions.Participants noted that the financial condition of federal and state governments continued to improve.  Inflows of tax revenues remained strong, consistent with expanding personal incomes, sales, and business profits. Economic activity abroad appeared to be slowing a little from the unusually rapid rate of the first half of the year, but still expanding at a reasonably good pace overall.  Foreign economic growth was expected to continue, albeit perhaps at a somewhat slower pace than expected by some outside forecasters, contributing to increases in U.S. exports.Participants took note of the jump in labor compensation in the first half of the year, but commented that the increase likely reflected in part the exercise of stock options.  Nonetheless, some participants viewed the recent increase in overall compensation as pointing to upside risks to inflation.  Participants reported steady gains in employment in various regions, roughly in line with expansion of the labor force.  Many business contacts continued to experience shortages of labor and accelerating wages, particularly for certain types of professionals and skilled workers and, in some areas, unskilled workers.One participant highlighted that, in the staff forecast, labor force growth would begin to slow over the next few years as more members of the baby-boom generation retired.  Even if resource utilization rates were unchanged, slower growth of the labor force would mean that increases in employment would be significantly lower, on average, than those registered in recent years.  In that case, the slower growth of the labor force and employment implied that the expansion of potential GDP could be somewhat lower than it had been earlier this decade.  Some participants commented, however, that they viewed potential output growth, as well as expansion of actual output, as likely to remain solid over the next several years.Many meeting participants emphasized that they continued to be quite concerned about the outlook for inflation.  Recent rates of core inflation, if they persisted, were seen as higher than consistent with price stability, and participants underscored the importance of ensuring a moderation in inflation.  To be sure, very recent data on inflation suggested some improvement from the situation in the late spring, partly reflecting slower increases in owners\\' equivalent rent.  Also, the considerably lower level of energy prices of recent weeks, if sustained, would help reduce overall inflation and damp increases in core prices.  Moreover, businesses would meet more resistance to attempts to pass through cost increases in the less robust economic circumstances that were likely to prevail at least for a time.  However, energy prices remained quite sensitive to a wide range of forces, including geopolitical developments, and might well rebound.  To date, the available evidence indicated that inflation expectations remained contained--indeed, expectations of price increases for the next few years had fallen some as energy prices declined.  Nonetheless, several participants worried that inflation expectations could rise and the Federal Reserve\\'s willingness to carry through on its intention to seek price stability could be called into question if cost and price pressures mounted or even if there was no moderation in core inflation.  Looking forward, most participants thought that the most likely outcome was a reduction in inflation pressures, but the anticipated decline was only gradual and the uncertainties around that forecast were skewed toward higher rather than lower inflation rates.In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, nearly all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting.  Members generally expected economic activity to expand at a pace below the rate of growth of potential output in the near term before strengthening some over time.  Moreover, given the uncertainties in forecasting, significantly more sluggish performance than anticipated could not be entirely ruled out.   Although the uncertainties were substantial, core inflation seemed most likely to ebb gradually from its elevated level, in part owing to the waning effects of past increases in energy prices.  The anticipated expansion of economic activity at a pace slightly below the rate of growth of the economy\\'s potential would likely also play a role by easing pressures on resources.  Members noted that certain developments of late--appreciable declines in energy prices, some softer indicators of economic activity, and slightly lower readings on core inflation--pointed to a modestly better inflation outlook and hence made the policy decision today somewhat less difficult than it was in August, when it was seen as a particularly close call.In view of the most recent information on the economy, members agreed that it was appropriate for the post-meeting statement to characterize economic growth as apparently continuing to moderate.  However, in view of still-high energy and other commodity prices and elevated rates of resource utilization as well as recent indications of a possible acceleration in labor costs, members continued to see a substantial risk that inflation would not decline as anticipated by the Committee.  Consequently, the Committee agreed that the statement should again cite such risks to inflation and explicitly reference the possibility of additional policy firming.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/4 percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p.m.:\"Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\"Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke and Geithner, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Guynn, Kohn, Kroszner, and Mishkin, Ms. Pianalto, Mr. Warsh, and Ms.Yellen.Votes against this action:  Mr. Lacker.Mr. Lacker dissented because he believed that further tightening was needed to bring inflation down more rapidly than would be the case if the policy rate were kept unchanged.  Recent data indicated that inflation remained above levels consistent with price stability.  Moreover, the upswing in compensation and unit labor costs in the first half of the year indicated that inflation risks were tilted to the upside.  Although real growth was likely to be moderate in coming quarters, in his view it was unlikely to be slow enough to bring core inflation down.The meeting adjourned at 1:20 p.m. Notation VoteBy notation vote completed on August 28, 2006, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on August 8, 2006.

There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The Manager also discussed with the Committee the results of a recent review of the management of the domestic security holdings of the SOMA.  The Manager noted that in 2000, in response to reduced issuance of Treasury securities, limits were adopted on the SOMA\\'s holdings of individual Treasury bonds, notes, and bills that ranged between 15 percent and 35 percent of amounts outstanding.  In recent years, those limits had created occasional operational complications for the Trading Desk.  Meanwhile, circumstances in the Treasury securities market had changed considerably, and the Manager noted that he intended to revert to the previous practice of applying a single 35 percent limit across all issues.The Chairman noted that the President had recently signed the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006, which among its provisions gave the Federal Reserve discretion, beginning October 2011, both to pay interest on reserve balances and to reduce further or eliminate reserve requirements.  The Act potentially has important implications for many aspects of the Federal Reserve\\'s operations and the Chairman asked Vincent Reinhart, Director of the Division of Monetary Affairs, to form a committee of Federal Reserve System staff to consider these issues.The information reviewed at the October meeting suggested that economic activity increased at a slow pace in the third quarter.  The contraction in home construction remained a significant drag on economic activity, and steep reductions in motor vehicle assemblies further weighed on growth in the third quarter.  Nonetheless, consumer spending and business investment continued to hold up well.  Payroll employment extended its moderate expansion, on average, through September.  Sharp declines in energy prices reduced total consumer price inflation in September, but the twelve-month change in core prices remained elevated relative to year-earlier readings. Nonfarm payrolls rose modestly in September after a larger increase in August, with some of the variation apparently a result of seasonal factors.  In September, job increases in the service-producing sectors were fairly widespread and were again led by the health-care industry.  The construction sector also added jobs; the lift came from gains associated with nonresidential building that more than offset further losses in the residential sector.  Job cutbacks in the retail trade and manufacturing sectors continued.  Aggregate hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers again edged lower.  The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.6 percent in August.  After having been flat in August, industrial production declined in September, reflecting a sizable weather-related decrease in the output of utilities and a fairly broad-based reduction in manufacturing output.  These declines were partially offset by a rise in output in the mining sector that was led by gains in crude oil extraction and in mined construction supplies, such as stone, sand, and gravel.  The output of motor vehicles and parts fell in September, as automakers continued to trim production of light trucks in response to bloated inventories.  Output growth in the high-technology sector softened a bit in September relative to the summer months, reflecting a smaller rise in the production of semiconductors.  Computer production continued to increase at a tepid rate, while output of communications equipment turned up noticeably after a decline in August.  For the third quarter as a whole, growth in industrial production moderated a bit relative to the first half of the year; stronger output in the high-technology sector and a pickup in the production of business equipment partially offset a steep contraction in the output of motor vehicles and parts and a slowdown in mining output. Real consumer spending appeared to regain some steam in September after a lackluster August.  Although nominal retail sales fell noticeably in September, the steep drop in gasoline prices more than accounted for the decline.  Excluding sales at gasoline stations, the step-up in consumer spending was the result of faster sales of motor vehicles and broad-based strength in outlays for other categories of goods, particularly apparel.  Real disposable income rose moderately in both July and August; the pace was somewhat above its second-quarter average.  Consumer spending continued to draw support from the lagged effects of the increases in household wealth over the past two years.  But interest rates on some types of household loans, both short- and long-term, had risen this year, on balance.  The latest readings on consumer sentiment had been positive, perhaps reflecting the recent declines in oil prices.  The personal saving rate edged up in August after a dip in July.Residential construction activity remained weak.  Single-family starts ticked up in September, but new permit issuance slid further to its lowest level in nearly five years.  Construction in the multifamily sector continued to fluctuate within the range that has prevailed for several years.  Sales of new single-family homes edged up in August, while sales of existing homes held steady.  Pending home sales, which rose somewhat in August after a noticeable drop in July, and the decline in mortgage rates since July likely indicated some support for housing demand in the near term.  Still, the overhang of unsold homes remained historically high, and price appreciation of existing homes continued to slow through the second quarter.Real spending on equipment and software increased at a solid pace during the summer as the fundamental influences on such spending remained favorable for the most part.  In particular, although business output had recently been rising at a slower rate, corporate financial reserves remained plentiful and the cost of high-tech capital goods continued to fall.  In the high-tech sector, real outlays on communications equipment likely stabilized in August after having surged earlier this year, and the available data suggested that real computer spending picked up in the third quarter.  In the transportation sector, business purchases of motor vehicles were brisk of late; the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s regulations on truck emissions that are scheduled to take effect in 2007 likely pulled forward some spending on medium and heavy trucks.  Outlays on aircraft appeared to have risen somewhat in the third quarter from their extremely low second-quarter level.  Real spending on equipment other than high-tech and transportation items seemed to have retained considerable momentum in the third quarter.  Activity in the nonresidential construction sector continued to strengthen in August.Book-value data on manufacturing and trade inventories, which were available through August, suggested that the rate of stockbuilding remained substantial in the third quarter.  A major exception was the motor vehicle sector, where the cutbacks in assemblies probably began to reduce the inventory overhang in that sector.  Outside of the motor vehicle sector, inventories generally appeared to be well aligned with demand.  Although survey data in September showed a noticeable rise in the share of firms that viewed their inventories as being too high, a large majority remained comfortable with their level.The U.S. international trade deficit widened to another record in August, reflecting a surge in imports that more than offset a sizable jump in exports.  The sharp increase in imports was driven importantly by oil and natural gas, but imports of capital goods and non-oil industrial supplies, particularly metals, also exhibited large gains.  Imports of services fell back slightly.  The increase in exports was led by capital goods, with aircraft, computers, semiconductors, and other machinery all climbing briskly.  Exports of industrial supplies and consumer goods also rose strongly, while exports of services expanded modestly. Economic activity in the foreign industrial economies continued to expand at a relatively solid pace in the third quarter.  Investment spending boosted the expansion in Japan.   In the euro area, data on industrial production and retail sales were consistent with robust growth in real activity.   Mixed indicators in Canada and the United Kingdom suggested that output growth in those countries remained around recent rates.  Incoming data across the emerging-market economies continued to point to moderating, but solid, growth in economic activity in the third quarter.Core prices for personal consumption expenditures were expected to have risen in September at the same pace as in July and August, leaving the change over the twelve months ending in September a bit higher than the year-earlier period.  Increases in shelter costs, which accounted for a significant proportion of the pickup in core inflation over the past year, had slowed considerably in recent months but remained well above the rates that prevailed from 2003 to 2005.  The price index for total personal consumption expenditures was estimated to have fallen markedly in September because of the steep decline in gasoline prices, bringing its twelve-month increase to a two-and-one-half-year low.  Retail gasoline prices fell especially rapidly in September as crude oil prices declined and as the historically high level of gasoline inventories likely led to a sharp narrowing of margins between retail gasoline prices and crude oil prices.  The producer price index for core intermediate materials rose only slightly in September; the increase was well below its average monthly advance over the preceding twelve months, reflecting a drop in prices of some chemicals that have a high energy content.  Average hourly earnings increased moderately in both August and September after a larger gain in July.  Survey measures of households\\' year-ahead inflation expectations eased substantially in early October with the sharp drop in energy prices.  Respondents\\' longer-term inflation expectations changed little, remaining well within the narrow range reported over the past year.              At its September meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to maintain its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  The Committee\\'s accompanying statement indicated that the moderation in economic growth had appeared to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market.  Readings on core inflation had been elevated, and the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to sustain inflation pressures.  However, inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.  Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.The FOMC\\'s decision at its September meeting to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged had been largely anticipated by investors, and policy expectations for mid-2007 and beyond rose only slightly.  Investors subsequently revised down their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate in light of some data releases that indicated weaker-than-expected economic activity.  However, those declines were then rolled back in the wake of speeches by FOMC members, the release of the minutes of the September FOMC meeting, and stronger-than-expected economic data.  Over the intermeeting period, yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury coupon securities rose somewhat, on net.  Inflation compensation for 2007 declined modestly, perhaps reflecting the further drop in spot energy prices, but was largely unchanged at longer maturities.  Spreads of investment-grade corporate bond yields over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities held steady, while those on speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed a little.  Broad equity indexes rose noticeably.  The trade-weighted index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar versus major currencies rose somewhat on balance, and the gains were spread evenly against most currencies.Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors in the third quarter was estimated to be expanding at around its second-quarter pace.  Business debt rose more moderately as bank lending to businesses slowed.  In particular, bank lending to finance commercial real estate activity waned in August and September, while commercial and industrial loans, which had been expanding briskly for many months, slowed sharply in September.  In the household sector, the further slowing of the rate of increase of house prices appeared to have continued to weigh on the expansion of mortgage debt in the third quarter.  M2 grew slowly in the third quarter, exhibiting the lagged effects of earlier increases in opportunity costs and the slow rise in nominal spending.       The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that growth of real GDP had slowed further in the third quarter, reflecting both a significant drag from the continuing contraction in residential construction and a steep decline in motor vehicle assemblies.   Looking ahead, a gradual reduction in the restraining effects of the contraction in residential investment and further solid gains in consumer and business spending were expected to lead to a pickup in GDP growth through 2007 and into 2008.  These gains in spending were likely to be supported by past declines in energy prices and continued gains in payroll employment and labor income.  Real GDP was expected to rise at a somewhat slower rate over the next two years than in 2006 in part as a result of less impetus from household wealth, interest rates, and fiscal policy.  The projected increase in real output over the next year or so was a little below the staff\\'s estimate of potential output growth, leading to a lessening in pressures on resource utilization.  Core inflation was anticipated to edge down in 2007 and 2008 relative to the second half of this year because of the diminishing impetus from the prices of energy and other commodities and because of the modest easing in resource utilization.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that incoming data over the relatively brief intermeeting period had come in broadly as anticipated.  The most recent indicators suggested that economic growth had probably slowed more sharply in the third quarter than had been expected at the time of the September meeting, but that appeared to largely reflect the impact of temporary influences.  Participants continued to expect the economy to expand at a rate close to or a little below the economy\\'s long-run sustainable pace over coming quarters.  The ongoing adjustment in the housing market was likely to depress real activity in the near term, but this effect was expected to wane gradually; private final domestic purchases had held up well in recent months and looked set to expand at a reasonably good pace.  Although recent monthly inflation readings indicated some slowing of core inflation from the very rapid rates of spring and early summer, many participants noted that current rates of core inflation remained undesirably high.  Most participants expected core inflation to moderate gradually, but they were quite uncertain as to the likely pace and extent of that moderation.In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy, participants noted that housing activity was likely to remain a substantial drag on economic growth over the next few quarters.  Many participants drew some comfort from the most recent data, which suggested that the correction in the housing market was likely to be no more severe than they had previously expected and that the risk of an even larger contraction in this sector had ebbed.  But further adjustment in the housing market appeared likely.  Single-family housing permits continued to fall and inventories of unsold homes remained at historically high levels.  Contacts in the building sector suggested that construction firms were attempting to reduce their backlogs of unsold homes, both by cutting back sharply on new construction and by offering substantial price incentives.  Several meeting participants noted the considerable strain on some small- and medium-sized residential construction firms. To date, weakness in the housing market and the associated downshift in house price appreciation did not seem to be spilling over into consumer spending, which appeared to have grown at a steady pace in recent months.  Retail activity in most Districts had been relatively robust and contacts in the retail sector were generally upbeat about the outlook.  Several participants noted, however, that contacts within the transportation sector had reported that activity in anticipation of the holiday shopping season appeared to be softer than in previous years.  Meeting participants judged that consumer expenditures going forward were likely to expand at a steady pace a little below the growth in disposable income, supported by favorable financial conditions, continued increases in employment and income, and the recent decline in energy prices.  Nonetheless, many participants expressed concern that ongoing developments in the housing market could have a more pronounced impact on consumer and other spending, especially if house prices declined significantly.Investment spending also appeared to be holding up well.  Meeting participants reported that their business contacts were generally optimistic and perceived the economic outlook as relatively favorable.  Several participants noted that growth in nonresidential construction remained robust and was absorbing some of the resources displaced from the residential sector.  The strength of corporate balance sheets and profits was seen as likely to help maintain a solid profile for investment spending over the next year or so, despite some restraint from the slower growth in final sales.  However, one participant observed that the uncertainty concerning the possible severity of the current slowing in economic growth could lead some businesses to delay investment plans. In contrast to the steady expansion of consumer and business investment spending in recent months, several other components of output and demand appeared to have been somewhat weaker than expected.  In particular, apparently uncomfortably high levels of inventories within the auto sector had prompted a sharp reduction in light vehicle production in the third quarter.  Federal expenditures had been held down by surprisingly weak defense outlays.  And strong growth in imports in July and August, driven in part by a surge in oil imports, suggested that net exports probably posed an arithmetic drag on economic growth in the third quarter.  However, participants judged that the recent weakness in these components largely reflected temporary influences and was not likely to depress the pace of economic expansion going forward.  That said, one participant did note the possibility that the recent decline in oil prices may in part stem from weakness in global demand.Both data and reports from businesses indicated that the labor market remained tight.  Employment had continued to rise at a steady pace, and participants reported that many of their contacts were increasingly concerned about the difficulty of recruiting suitably qualified workers.  Shortages were most pronounced for certain types of professional and skilled workers.  These reports of shortages and the associated wage pressures had not unambiguously shown through in the aggregate compensation data, which were giving contradictory signals about whether compensation increases were picking up.  However, the possibility that the tightness of the labor market could lead to a sustained increase in wage pressure was viewed by participants as an upside risk to costs and their expectations of a gradual decline in inflation.  It was noted, though, that continuing high profit margins provided some scope for increased labor costs to be absorbed without necessarily leading to elevated price pressures. All meeting participants expressed concern about the outlook for inflation.  Most participants expected core inflation to edge lower, in part as the effects of the run-up in energy prices in recent years waned.  And shelter costs were not expected to add materially to inflation going forward.  Moreover, moderate growth in aggregate demand and the associated modest easing of pressures on resource utilization should also contribute slightly to the slowing in core inflation.  Recent changes in core prices had declined slightly from earlier in the year.  Nonetheless, nearly all participants viewed the current rates of core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.  The available measures suggested that medium- and long-term inflation expectations remained around the levels seen for the past several years, although in the view of some participants these expectations were probably higher than would be consistent with their assessment of long-run price stability.  Participants were concerned that inflation expectations could begin to drift upwards if core inflation remained elevated for a protracted period.  Any such rise in inflation expectations and associated upward pressure on inflation itself would likely prove costly to reverse.  Although some participants noted that the recent slowing in core inflation had helped to allay their fears of a further sustained increase in inflation, all participants emphasized that the risks around the desired downward path to inflation remained to the upside.   In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, nearly all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting.  The Committee\\'s view of the outlook for economic growth and inflation had changed little since the previous meeting.  Nearly all members expected that the economy would expand close to or a little below its potential growth rate and that inflation would ebb gradually from its elevated levels.  Although substantial uncertainty continued to attend that outlook, most members judged that the downside risks to economic activity had diminished a little, and likewise, some members felt that the upside risks to inflation had declined, albeit only slightly.  All members agreed that the risks to achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation remained of greatest concern.  Members noted that a significant amount of data would be published before the next Committee meeting in December, giving the Committee ample scope to refine its assessment of the economic outlook before judging whether any additional firming was needed to address those risks.  Members agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should continue to convey that inflation risks remained the dominant concern and that additional policy firming was possible.  The Committee concurred that the statement should mention both that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year and that, going forward, the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace.  With energy prices well off the highs reached earlier in the year, members felt that it was no longer appropriate to note that the high level of energy prices had the potential to sustain inflation pressures.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/4 percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p.m.:\"Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.

Poole and Warsh, and Ms. Yellen.Votes against this action:Mr. LackerMr. Lacker dissented because he believed that further tightening was needed to help ensure that core inflation declines to an acceptable rate in coming quarters.The Committee then continued its discussion of communication issues and considered the advantages and disadvantages of quantifying an inflation objective.  Participants stressed that any such step had to be consistent with the statutory objectives for monetary policy.  In that regard, it was noted that over time price stability is a prerequisite for maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates.  However, the possible specification of a numerical price objective raised a number of complex and interrelated issues that required considerable further discussion.

Kahn and Sullivan, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of         New York and Chicago, respectivelyMr. Olivei, Senior Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of BostonThe Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at the December meeting suggested that economic activity was increasing at a subdued rate during the second half of the year.  The contraction in homebuilding was continuing to restrain overall activity, and a step-down in motor vehicle output held down industrial production.  In contrast, consumer spending and business investment were increasing at a moderate rate, and payroll employment expanded solidly through November.  Additional sharp declines in energy prices reduced total consumer price inflation in October, but the twelve-month change in core prices remained above its year-earlier level.Indicators from the labor market were generally strong through November.  Nonfarm payrolls increased at a solid pace, while revisions to previous estimates showed a larger gain, on balance, over the preceding two months.  Employment in manufacturing and construction industries fell in November, but hiring continued to be brisk in the professional and nonbusiness service industries.  Aggregate weekly hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers edged up.  The unemployment rate had fallen to 4.4 percent in October but ticked back up to 4.5 percent in November, remaining below the average of 4.7 percent during the first three quarters of the year.Industrial production (IP) declined in September but rose slightly in October.  In October, total industrial production was boosted by a weather-related rebound in electricity generation, while output in the mining sector posted a sizable gain as crude oil extraction in Alaska returned to full production following pipeline repairs.  Manufacturing output fell in both months, partly because of cutbacks in motor vehicle production as vehicle makers pared elevated inventories in light trucks.  Although less pronounced than in the motor vehicle sector, the recent softness in factory output was also apparent in a number of other sectors.  A notable exception was production in high-tech industries, which posted another solid increase in October, reflecting a pickup in computer output and a rise in semiconductor production attributable to the rollout of a new generation of microprocessors.The National Income and Product Accounts for the third quarter incorporated an estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) that gross output of new motor vehicles increased at a rapid pace in the third quarter, a sharp contrast to a drop in the IP index for motor vehicles (including parts production) for that same period.  Much of that difference could be attributed to the BEA\\'s method of inferring motor vehicle output from separate data on sales, net international trade, and changes in inventories rather than measuring output directly using data on production.  In addition, a large drop in the producer price index for light trucks in the third quarter resulted in a jump in the BEA\\'s implied unit values of light trucks in inventory.  In the staff\\'s view, these measurement issues likely caused an overstatement of the rate of increase in real GDP in the third quarter, and the gradual unwinding of those effects would probably lead to an understatement of real GDP growth over the next several quarters.Real consumer spending increased strongly in October after a more modest gain in September.  Although purchases of motor vehicles weakened in October, outlays on a broad range of other categories of goods, including gasoline, food, and apparel, rose briskly.  Spurred by sharp declines in consumer energy prices, real disposable income also increased rapidly in September and October.  Despite the further deceleration in house prices, the ratio of household wealth to disposable income remained well above its historical average, buoyed by robust gains in the stock market.  Readings on consumer sentiment edged down in November and early December but stayed above levels seen in the summer.Residential construction activity continued to be very weak.  Single-family housing starts dropped substantially in October after a slight increase in September, while new permit issuance fell to nearly its lowest level in the past ten years.  Construction in the much-smaller multifamily sector continued to fluctuate within a range that had prevailed for the past several years.  Inventories of unsold homes remained high in October but were a bit lower than those in preceding months.  Sales of new and existing homes showed tentative signs of stabilizing, although at levels well below their mid-2005 peaks.  Price appreciation of existing homes continued to slow in the third quarter, and some price measures showed outright declines.Real spending on equipment and software continued to increase at a solid pace in the third quarter, supported by strong corporate cash positions and a low cost of capital.  Early indicators for the fourth quarter, including survey measures of business conditions, suggested a slowdown in spending, in part reflecting the deceleration in business output.  Business purchases of motor vehicles were likely to continue to be boosted by an increase in spending in advance of the upcoming change in regulations on truck engines from the Environmental Protection Agency.  Although spending on high-tech capital goods and software expanded at a robust pace in the third quarter, data on new orders and shipments in October pointed to more moderate growth in the fourth quarter.  Growth of nonresidential construction spending appeared to have slowed from a rapid rate earlier in the year, responding in part to still-high vacancy rates in the office and industrial categories.  The number of natural gas and petroleum drilling rigs in operation had moved down, on balance, since September in response to the moderation in energy prices. Unit stocks of light motor vehicles dropped in the third quarter.  Outside the motor vehicle sector, real nonfarm inventories edged up, and the ratio of book-value inventories to sales for both the manufacturing and trade sectors rose in September to levels last seen in mid-2005.  Inventory imbalances appeared more widespread than a few months earlier, although business surveys through November indicated that a large majority of firms perceived that their customers\\' inventories remained at comfortable levels.  The U.S. international trade deficit declined in September from a record level in August.  The narrowing primarily reflected a sharp falloff in the value of imported oil, although non-oil imports, including industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive products, also declined.  Export growth in September was led by aircraft and industrial supplies, while exports of automotive products, consumer goods, and semiconductors fell.  The trade deficit shrank a bit further in October.Economic activity in the advanced foreign economies rose at a moderate rate in the third quarter.  The expansion in real activity in the euro area, although slower than the staff had expected, was supported by strong domestic demand.  Canada\\'s real GDP growth was dragged down by weakness in inventories and government spending, while slumping private consumption weighed on growth in Japan.  The U.K. economy, buoyed by strong investment, continued to expand solidly.  Recent economic indicators for the developing economies were somewhat mixed but suggested generally brisk growth in the third quarter.The overall price index for personal consumption expenditures fell in September and October, reflecting sharp declines in energy prices in both months; the declines left the change in that index over the twelve months ending in October substantially lower than over the preceding twelve-month period.  In contrast, the change in the core price index for personal consumption expenditures over the twelve months ending in October was still somewhat higher than it was a year earlier, largely reflecting an acceleration in shelter costs over that period.  The producer price index for core intermediate materials was flat in October.  Increases in average hourly earnings had been moderate in recent months, and compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector appeared to have risen at a subdued rate in the third quarter.  The estimated increase in hourly compensation for the second quarter had been revised down substantially; hourly compensation was now estimated to have declined in the second quarter following the sharp gain recorded in the first quarter.  This uneven pattern suggested that the surge in hourly compensation in the first quarter had largely been driven by transitory factors.  Hourly compensation of private industry workers, as measured by the employment cost index, increased at a somewhat faster rate in the three months ending in September than it had in preceding quarters.  At its October meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to maintain its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  The Committee\\'s accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market.  Going forward, the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace.  Readings on core inflation had been elevated, and the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain inflation pressures.  However, inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.  Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that might be needed to address these risks would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.         Investors had largely anticipated the FOMC\\'s decision at its October meeting to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged and to make only modest changes in the accompanying policy statement.  As a result, the announcement of the decision elicited little market reaction, as did the subsequent publication of the minutes of the meeting.  However, somewhat weaker-than-anticipated economic data over the intermeeting period apparently led to some softening of investors\\' perception of the economic outlook.  As a result, the likely pace and extent of policy easing expected by investors increased, and yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury coupon securities fell.  Inflation compensation measures were little changed.  Spreads of investment-grade corporate bond yields over those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities remained about unchanged, while those on speculative-grade corporate bonds rose a bit.  Broad equity indexes showed solid gains.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies fell, on net, over the intermeeting period, with pronounced declines against the euro and sterling.  Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors in the third quarter expanded at around its second-quarter pace.  Business debt rose slightly more slowly than in the second quarter, in part reflecting reduced borrowing in the bond and commercial paper markets.  In the household sector, mortgage debt increased at its lowest pace since the late 1990s, reflecting the continued deceleration in house prices.  M2 rose more strongly in October and November than it had in preceding months. The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that growth in economic activity had slowed to a pace below that of the economy\\'s long-run potential in the second half of 2006, partly as a result of the ongoing adjustment of the housing sector.  The rate of increase in real GDP was expected to pick up gradually as the drag from the contraction in residential construction diminished, returning towards the end of 2007 to a rate close to the staff\\'s estimate of potential output growth.  Core inflation was anticipated to edge down in 2007 and 2008 in response to a waning of the effects of higher energy and import prices, a step-down in rent increases, and the emergence of a small amount of slack in the economy.     In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that their assessments of the medium-term prospects for economic growth and inflation were little changed from the previous meeting.  Incoming indicators of near-term activity had been mixed, with some spending and production data pointing to a more subdued picture than that suggested by the still-solid labor market data.  Many participants judged that economic activity in the second half of this year was probably a touch softer than had been expected at the time of the October meeting.  But looking over the next year or so, participants continued to expect the economy to expand at a rate close to or a little below the economy\\'s long-run sustainable pace.  The ongoing adjustment of the housing market was likely to damp economic growth in the near term, but this effect was expected to dissipate, and spending in other categories looked set to expand at a reasonably good pace.  Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, price pressures were not yet viewed as convincingly on a downward trend.  Most participants expected core inflation to moderate slowly over time, but stressed that the risks to the inflation outlook remained to the upside.In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy, participants noted that developments in the housing market continued to weigh heavily on economic activity.  Housing starts and permits for new construction had dropped sharply in October, and contacts in the building sector reported that construction firms were continuing to cancel options on land purchases.  However, there were some indications that home sales might be starting to stabilize, aided by a marked slowing in the rate of increase of house prices and a decline in mortgage rates in recent months.  Several participants also noted that a range of non-price incentives and concessions were being offered by construction firms to bolster sales.  But even if home purchases had begun to level off, residential investment was likely to fall further in coming quarters as homebuilders sought to reduce their backlogs of unsold homes.Thus far, the adjustment of activity and prices in the housing market did not appear to have spilled over significantly to consumer spending, which had expanded at a steady pace in recent months, buoyed by continued gains in employment and by a decline in energy prices.  Retailers in most Districts expected good sales over the holiday season, although some contacts at package delivery and trucking firms reported that activity was less busy than usual for this time of year.  Participants noted the downward revision to the BEA\\'s estimate of personal income in the second quarter of this year, but nonetheless continued to anticipate consumer expenditures to expand at a steady pace going forward.  Growth in consumer spending was expected to be supported by favorable financial conditions and solid gains in income from employment, outweighing any damping effect of sluggish increases in housing wealth.  Still, considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate extent of the housing market correction meant that spillovers to consumption could become more evident, especially if house prices were to decline significantly.Business investment appeared to have decelerated recently, and surveys and orders data pointed to a relatively slow rise in equipment and software spending over the next few quarters.  Incoming data on construction activity and employment also suggested that, following very rapid growth earlier in the year, increases in nonresidential construction spending could be moderating considerably.  However, the weaker cast of some of these data contrasted with the sense of optimism among business contacts.  Moreover, several participants noted that contacts within the construction sector had reported that commercial real estate activity remained robust, encouraged by lower vacancy rates, some firming in rents, and accommodative financial conditions.  Looking further ahead, meeting participants expected investment to expand at a solid pace, supported by strong corporate balance sheets and profits and by the ready availability of funding from financial markets and institutions, factors that were expected to be offset only partially by restraint from slower growth in final sales.Recent data suggested that aggregate demand in the rest of the world was likely to continue to expand at a somewhat faster rate than in the United States.  Participants noted that the strength of global demand and the recent decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar should help to support increases in U.S. exports.The slowing in the pace of economic expansion in recent quarters evidenced by the business spending data was also apparent in measures of industrial production.  Much of the slowing in production had been concentrated in the motor vehicle sector--as producers had cut assemblies in order to reduce high inventory levels--and in construction-related sectors.  But, more recently, inventories had increased in a number of other sectors, and manufacturing production had been trimmed in response.  Further adjustments remained possible, suggesting an additional source of downside risk to economic growth in the near term.  In contrast, indicators of activity in the services sector implied continued brisk growth.   Participants noted that recent indicators provided mixed signals about the strength of near-term activity.  Solid gains in employment over recent quarters stood in contrast to the softer pace of economic expansion suggested by the spending and production data.  That difference most likely reflected lags between movements in activity and employment, implying that growth in employment would probably slow over the next quarter or so.  Participants suggested that other forces might be at work as well.  The growth of structural labor productivity could be weaker than currently thought, helping to reconcile the steady growth in employment with more subdued advances in spending and output.  Moreover,  the recent pace of activity may have been stronger than that indicated by the spending and production data.  With regard to this possibility, it was noted that gross domestic income had grown substantially more quickly than measured GDP over the past year. Incoming data and reports from businesses suggested that the labor market remained tight.  The unemployment rate had moved slightly lower on balance over recent months, and many business contacts reported difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified workers, especially for certain types of professional and skilled positions.  The downward revision to the estimated increases in labor compensation and unit labor costs earlier in the year had eased some participants\\' concerns about the extent of the pressures on labor resources.  Nonetheless, the possibility that the tightness of the labor market could lead to sustained upward pressure on nominal labor costs was viewed as an upside risk to the expected moderation in inflation. All meeting participants remained concerned about the outlook for inflation.  Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.  Participants expected core inflation to edge lower over time, in part as the pass-through of higher prices for energy and other commodities ran its course and as the moderate growth in aggregate demand likely led to a modest easing of pressures on resources.  Some participants also highlighted the impact that movements in the prices of individual components of the price index, such as owners\\' equivalent rent and medical costs, could have on near-term readings on core inflation.  More generally, participants stressed there was considerable uncertainty as to the probable pace and extent of the moderation in core inflation and that the risks around this desired downward path remained to the upside.  Moreover, participants expressed concern that a failure of inflation to moderate as expected could entail significant costs if an upward drift in inflation expectations ensued. In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, nearly all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting.  The outlook for economic growth and inflation was thought to have changed relatively little since the previous meeting.  Nearly all members felt that maintaining the current target for now was most likely to foster moderate economic growth and a gradual ebbing of core inflation from its elevated levels.  Several members judged that the subdued tone of some incoming indicators meant that the downside risks to economic growth in the near term had increased a little and become a bit more broadly based than previously thought.  Nonetheless, all members agreed that the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as desired remained the predominant concern. In light of the data received over the intermeeting period, members felt that the statement should characterize the cooling in the housing market as substantial and should note that recent indicators had been mixed.  The Committee thought that the statement should reiterate that the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace, while also recognizing the possibility that measured GDP growth could be somewhat uneven in coming quarters.  Members agreed that the statement should continue to convey that inflation risks remained of greatest concern and that additional policy firming was possible.  One member did not favor language that referenced only the possibility of additional policy firming and believed that, although the risks to inflation remained the predominant concern, the statement should emphasize that policy could be adjusted in either direction depending on the evolution of the outlook for inflation and economic growth.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/4 percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p.m.:\"Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\"  Votes for this action: Messrs.

Poole and Warsh, and Ms. Yellen.Votes against this action:Mr. LackerMr. Lacker dissented because he believed that further tightening was needed to help ensure that core inflation declines to an acceptable rate in coming quarters.Meeting participants briefly reviewed some issues regarding communications and the next steps in their continuing discussion of the topic.

Accordingly, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was adopted, effective January 30, 2007, as shown below:AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS(Amended January 30, 2007)1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement;(b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, from dealers for the account of the System Open Market Account under agreements for repurchase of such securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers.(c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States to dealers for System Open Market Account under agreements for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations in 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers.2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend on an overnight basis U.S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be determined by competitive bidding.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program and apply reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue that may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each dealer may borrow.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could facilitate a dealer\\'s ability to control a single issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities in 65 business days or less on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agency  accounts maintained at the Bank.  Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.4. In the execution of the Committee\\'s decision regarding policy during any intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman of the Committee, to adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of pressure on reserve positions and hence the intended federal funds rate.  Any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee\\'s discussion and decision at its most recent meeting and the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments during the intermeeting period.  Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any adjustment.By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations was reaffirmed in the form shown below:AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS(Reaffirmed January 30, 2007)1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent necessary to carry out the Committee\\'s foreign currency directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the Committee may issue from time to time:A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Treasury, with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with other international financial institutions:Canadian dollarsDanish kronerEuroPounds sterlingJapanese yenMexican pesosNorwegian kronerSwedish kronorSwiss francsB. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above.C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding $25.0 billion.  For this purpose, the overall open position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in individual currencies.  The net position in a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (\"swap\" arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew such arrangements on maturity:Foreign bankAmount of arrangement            (millions of dollars equivalent) Bank of Canada2,000Bank of Mexico3,000Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates.  For the purpose of providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign currencies or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions.  In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  Such investments may include buying or selling outright obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a foreign government or agency thereof; buying such securities under agreements for repurchase of such securities; selling such securities under agreements for the resale of such securities; and holding various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions.  In addition, when appropriate in connection with arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency holdings, U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign central banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar days.6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee.  The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, his alternate).  Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the request of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), for the purposes of reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other matters relating to his responsibilities.  At the request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open Market Committee.7. The Chairman is authorized:A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the Treasury;B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary on policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors\\' Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.By unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive was reaffirmed in the form shown below:FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE(Reaffirmed January 30, 2007)1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1.2. To achieve this end the System shall:A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign exchange.B. Maintain reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with selected foreign central banks.C. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other countries and with international monetary institutions.3. Transactions may also be undertaken:A. To adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies.B. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund.C. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the Committee.4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted:A. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the United States Treasury;B. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary authorities; andC. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United States in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange arrangements under IMF Article IV.By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations were reaffirmed in the form shown below:PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS(Reaffirmed January 30, 2007)In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), shall be guided by the following procedural understandings with respect to consultations and clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee.  All operations undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):A.\\tAny operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.B.\\tAny operation that would result in a change on any day in the System\\'s net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with repayment of swap drawings.C.\\tAny operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change in the System\\'s net position in that currency might be less than the limits specified in 1.B.D.\\tAny swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):A.\\tAny operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.B.\\tAny swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any operations that are not of a routine character.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at the January meeting, which included the advance data on the national income and product accounts for the fourth quarter, showed that economic expansion had picked up in the fourth quarter of 2006, but was uneven across sectors.  Considerable vigor in consumer spending late last year boosted economic growth in the fourth quarter, supported by further increases in employment and income.  A surge in net exports and a pickup in defense spending also raised output growth last quarter, but these factors were expected to prove largely transitory.  The decline in residential construction continued to weigh on overall activity, but some indications of stabilization in the demand for homes had emerged.  Outlays for business fixed investment softened in the fourth quarter.  Although a spike in energy prices lifted total consumer price inflation in December, readings on core inflation had edged lower in recent months.The labor market exhibited continued strength through year-end.  Nonfarm payrolls rose robustly again in December, driven by further gains in the service-producing sectors.  Employment in the manufacturing and construction industries declined further, but by less than in the previous several months.  Aggregate hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers edged up further.  The unemployment rate held steady at 4.5 percent.Industrial production firmed in December after having softened in the preceding three months.  Output of manufacturing industries rose noticeably in December after being flat in November; the increase was associated with sizable gains in the production of semiconductors, computers, and commercial aircraft.  Motor vehicle output turned up in November and December, but remained low compared with earlier in the year as vehicle makers continued their efforts to pare inventories.  After contracting in November, output in the mining sector increased in December, boosted by a rise in the production of crude oil.  In contrast, unseasonably warm weather caused a sharp cutback in the output of utilities in December.Real consumer spending rose briskly in November and December, buoyed by sizable increases in outlays for non-auto consumer goods.  Spending on services, in contrast, appeared to be expanding only moderately toward year-end, as warmer-than-usual temperatures led to a drop in real outlays for energy services in November and probably damped expenditures in that category again in December.  Real disposable income posted solid gains in October and November and likely rose further in December, reflecting increases in wages and salaries and further declines in energy prices.  Although house-price appreciation appeared to have slowed further since the end of the third quarter, robust gains in equity prices likely resulted in a small rise in the ratio of household wealth to disposable income last quarter.  Readings on consumer sentiment moved up at the end of last year and held steady in early 2007.Residential construction activity remained quite weak late last year, but home sales showed some tentative signs of stabilization.  Single-family housing starts declined modestly in December, reversing about half of November\\'s gain.  However, new permit issuance edged up in December after having moved down steadily for nearly a year.  Construction in the multifamily sector, which accounts for a much smaller share of new home construction, rose sharply in December to the upper end of the range that has prevailed over the past decade.  Sales of existing single-family homes held steady in November and rose in December, while sales of new homes inched up in both months. Inventories of unsold homes remained considerable although they ticked down in December for the second straight month.  The most timely indicators of home prices, which are not adjusted for changes in quality or the mix of homes sold, pointed to small declines.After having risen at a solid average pace in the first three quarters of last year, real investment in equipment and software fell in the fourth quarter.  Business outlays on transportation equipment, a volatile spending category, dropped considerably.  Sales of light vehicles to business customers declined to their lowest level in two years, which more than offset a surge in sales of medium and heavy trucks ahead of stricter regulations on truck engine emissions that went into effect this year.  Spending on high-tech capital goods moderated.  Outside of the transportation and high-tech sectors, real spending declined last quarter.  That weakness appeared to be concentrated in equipment related to construction and motor vehicle manufacturing.  Nonresidential construction activity decelerated late last quarter; however, indicators of future expenditures in this sector remained firm, with office and industrial vacancy rates somewhat below their historical averages.  Overall, prospects for business spending continued to be supported by robust corporate cash flow and a low cost of capital.Business inventories remained elevated in the fourth quarter.  In November, the book-value ratio of inventories to sales for the manufacturing and trade sectors (excluding motor vehicles) stood near its highest level since early 2005.  Although relatively high ratios of inventories to sales appeared to be associated in part with developments in the homebuilding and motor vehicle sectors, some indications of inventory imbalances in other sectors had recently become evident.The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed again in October, primarily reflecting declines in both the price and volume of imported oil.  In addition, imports of non-oil industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive products fell, offsetting small increases in imports of consumer goods, food, and services.  In November, the trade deficit edged down further--to its smallest level since mid-2005--as export growth outpaced a modest increase in non-oil imports, and oil imports remained flat.Economic activity in the advanced foreign economies appeared to have accelerated in the fourth quarter, supported by a broad-based firming of domestic demand and strong employment gains.  In the euro area, consumer sentiment was lifted by lower unemployment, and economic growth continued at a solid pace.  After contracting in the third quarter, consumption spending in Japan apparently rebounded last quarter, providing significant support to economic activity.  The expansion in the United Kingdom\\'s economy strengthened, likely reflecting a pickup in consumption growth.  Output growth in Canada seemed to have firmed but likely remained below trend.  Recent economic data for the emerging-market economies pointed to some moderation in the pace of growth in the fourth quarter.  In China, the most recent evidence suggested that growth had remained strong.While large fluctuations in energy prices continued to cause swings in overall consumer price inflation in recent months, readings on core inflation improved.  Overall consumer prices were flat in November, but turned up in December because of a surge in retail energy prices that month.  Still, the rise in the price index for personal consumption expenditures over the twelve months ending in December was estimated to have been noticeably less than that of the year-earlier period.  Prices for personal consumption expenditures other than those for food and energy were estimated to have increased slightly faster over the twelve months of 2006 than they did a year earlier.  However, the three-month change in core prices in December likely was down considerably from its peak in May.  Year-over-year increases in average hourly earnings late last year continued to run ahead of those a year earlier.  However, hourly compensation of private industry workers, as measured by the employment cost index, rose at a moderate rate in the three months ending in December, a touch below the pace registered in the previous quarter.  Survey measures of households\\' year-ahead inflation expectations held steady through January at levels that were below those reported in the second and third quarters of last year, and respondents\\' longer-term inflation expectations had been unchanged since ticking down in the middle of 2006.At its December meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to maintain its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  The Committee\\'s accompanying statement noted that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market.  Although recent indicators had been mixed, the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters.  Readings on core inflation had been elevated, and the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain inflation pressures.  However, inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.  Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.The FOMC\\'s decision at the December meeting to leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged and to retain the language in the statement regarding the risks to inflation appeared to match investors\\' expectations.  However, the characterization of recent economic growth was reportedly interpreted by market participants as suggesting a slight softening in the Committee\\'s outlook for the expansion.  As a result, the expected path of the federal funds rate beyond the near term edged down.  The subsequent release of the minutes from the meeting elicited little market reaction.  Investors\\' outlook for economic activity firmed over the intermeeting period, as economic data releases came in stronger than expected and oil prices declined notably.  As a result, investors markedly reduced the extent of policy easing anticipated over coming quarters, and yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury coupon securities rose.  Measures of inflation compensation were little changed on net.  Spreads of investment-grade corporate bond yields over those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities moved down a bit, while those of speculative-grade issues declined significantly more.  Broad equity indexes edged higher.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies rose, on balance, particularly versus the yen.Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors was estimated to have expanded in the fourth quarter at a pace that was close to that registered over the first three quarters of the year.  A pickup in merger-related borrowing appeared to boost business debt growth last quarter, and a sharp rise in the issuance of bonds and commercial paper more than offset a moderation in bank loans.  In the household sector, the ongoing deceleration in house prices further restrained the growth of home mortgage debt.  M2 continued to expand briskly in December and January, primarily reflecting strength in its liquid deposit component.In its forecast prepared ahead of the meeting, the staff had revised up its estimate of growth of aggregate economic activity in the fourth quarter.  Nonetheless, real GDP in the second half of last year was still projected to have increased at a pace that was a bit below the economy\\'s long-run potential, primarily because of the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector and the lower level of motor vehicle production.  Looking ahead, the staff expected the rate of increase in real GDP to be little changed in 2007 relative to the projected pace for the second half of 2006.  However, with the contraction in housing activity expected to abate this year, the pace of economic growth was anticipated to edge back up to a level that was close to the staff\\'s estimate of potential output growth by the end of 2007 and to remain in that same range throughout 2008.  In light of developments in futures markets, the paths of both energy and import prices were projected to be lower than was previously thought.  Against this background and with the rate of increase of shelter prices slowing down, the staff expected core inflation to edge down in 2007 and 2008.  The advance data on the national income and product accounts for the fourth quarter that were released on the morning of the second day of the FOMC meeting showed stronger-than-expected net exports and a larger-than-anticipated accumulation of inventories.  The staff interpreted this information as suggesting some upward revision to its estimate of output growth in the fourth quarter and perhaps a slight downward revision to its forecast for the current quarter.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that the economic information received since the last meeting pointed to a somewhat more favorable outlook regarding both inflation and economic growth than they had earlier anticipated.  Incoming data suggesting a leveling out in housing demand and strength in consumer spending outside the housing sector supported the view that the expansion remained resilient despite the appreciable decline in housing activity and recent weakness in the manufacturing sector.  Over the next several quarters, economic activity would likely advance at a pace at or modestly below the economy\\'s trend rate of growth.  Thereafter, growth was likely to return to around its trend rate, which several participants viewed as likely to be higher than the staff\\'s estimate.  Favorable readings on core inflation and lower energy prices had also improved the odds that inflation pressures would diminish.  However, it was noted that the prevailing level of inflation was uncomfortably high, and resource utilization was elevated.  The upside risks to inflation remained the Committee\\'s predominant concern.In preparation for the Federal Reserve\\'s semiannual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of nominal and real GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2007 and 2008, conditioned on their views of the appropriate path for monetary policy.  The projections of the growth of nominal GDP were in the range of 4-3/4 to 5-1/2 percent for both years, with a central tendency of 5 to 5-1/2 percent for 2007 and 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent for 2008.  Projections of the rate of expansion in real GDP for 2007 were in the 2-1/4 to    3-1/4 percent range, with a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 3 percent; for 2008 the forecasts were in the slightly higher range of 2-1/2 to 3-1/4 percent, with a central tendency of 2-3/4 to 3 percent.  These rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate in the range of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008; the central tendency of these projections was 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent for both years.  The rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE price index, was projected to edge down from a range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent in 2007, with the central tendency being the same, to a range of 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 percent in 2008, centered on 1-3/4 to 2 percent.In their discussion of the major sectors of the economy, participants noted that the housing market showed tentative signs of stabilization in most regions.  Anecdotal reports presented a mixed picture, with fairly firm home sales in some areas but continuing decline in others.  But aggregate data indicated that home sales, which had been essentially flat since mid-year, had risen a bit during the fourth quarter.  Mortgage applications for home purchases had risen from their low levels of last summer.  Sentiment among homebuilders reportedly had improved in the past few months, and the inventory of new homes for sale had fallen.  Nonetheless, participants noted that inventories remained elevated and needed to be worked down before growth in this sector resumed.  Unseasonably warm weather so far this winter complicated the interpretation of recent data, but participants were optimistic that the risk of a much larger contraction in housing had diminished and that the drag on growth from the housing sector would ease later this year.Participants saw continued gains in employment and incomes and lower energy prices as sustaining solid growth in consumer spending.  Contacts reported healthy holiday sales in many regions, particularly late in the Christmas season.  In addition, the growth of gift cards was mentioned as a factor that likely boosted retail sales in January.  To date, weakness in the housing market had not appeared to have spilled over to aggregate consumption, although some such effect could not be ruled out as the growth in households\\' home equity slowed. The recent strength of consumption spending, together with favorable readings from consumer sentiment surveys, suggested that households were optimistic about prospects for employment and income.  Indeed, the possibility that the personal saving rate would fail to rise as in the staff forecast was cited by some participants as posing a significant upside risk to the outlook.Meeting participants noted that continued gains in nonresidential construction spending were offsetting some of the weakness on the residential side.  Further advances in nonresidential investment were likely.  Office vacancy rates were reported as declining in some areas.  However, the recent decrease in energy prices had already led to a reduction in drilling activity and was likely to reduce some investment in alternative fuels.  Participants noted that business fixed investment overall continued to be weaker than anticipated, suggesting some caution on the part of businesses in expanding capacity.  Nonetheless, participants expected that, going forward, favorable financial conditions, strong corporate balance sheets, high profitability, and growth in sales would support a firming of investment spending.Net exports were unexpectedly strong in the fourth quarter.  In part, this development could be attributed to a temporary reduction in petroleum imports as a result of the unseasonably warm weather.  Although imports were likely to pick up again, global economic growth, which had been strong of late, was expected to continue to provide ongoing support for growth in exports.The more favorable budget positions of the state and local governments were seen as permitting additional spending by such governmental units and hence as an additional source of stimulus to the economy.   Strong federal tax receipts suggested that personal incomes were expanding vigorously.Participants reported some continuing softness in manufacturing, primarily in industries related to housing or automobiles.  The recent slackness in manufacturing activity appeared to be largely an inventory correction, which participants expected would be completed this year.  Participants noted that the tone of contacts in the industrial sector was generally more positive than at the time of the December meeting, and some survey information pointed to expectations of a rebound in manufacturing activity later this year.  However, the recent declines in energy prices were likely to restrain energy extraction as well as activity in associated energy-producing sectors.Many participants observed that labor markets remained relatively taut, with significant wage pressures being reported in some occupations.  In addition to the continuing shortages of skilled workers in technical and professional fields, recent reports suggested a scarcity of less skilled and unskilled workers in some areas of the country.  One participant observed that some of the sluggishness in manufacturing job growth could be due to difficulties in hiring rather than indicating weakness in demand.  So far, aggregate measures of labor compensation were showing only moderate increases, but looking ahead, the possibility that labor costs might rise more rapidly as a result of the tightness in labor market was seen as an upside risk to inflation.All meeting participants expressed some concern about the outlook for inflation.  To be sure, incoming data had suggested some improvement in core inflation, and a further gradual decline was seen as the most likely outcome, fostered in part by the continued stability of inflation expectations.  However, participants did not yet see a downtrend in core inflation as definitively established.  Although lower energy prices, declining core import prices, and a deceleration in owners\\' equivalent rent were expected to contribute to slower core inflation in coming months, the effects of some of these factors on inflation could well be temporary.  The influence of more enduring factors, importantly including pressures in labor and product markets and the behavior of inflation expectations, would primarily determine the extent of more persistent progress.  In light of the apparent underlying strength in aggregate demand, risks around the desired path of a further gradual decline in core inflation remained mainly to the upside.  Participants emphasized that a failure of inflation to moderate as expected could impair the long-term performance of the economy.In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting.  The confluence of better-than-expected news on economic activity and inflation suggested somewhat smaller downside risks to economic growth as well as improved prospects for core inflation.  Recent developments were seen as supporting the Committee\\'s view that maintaining the current target was likely to foster moderate economic growth and to further the gradual reduction of core inflation from its elevated level over the past year.  Nonetheless, Committee members saw continued risks to the economic outlook.  The ongoing contraction in the housing sector and the potential for spillovers to other sectors remained notable downside risks to economic activity, although those risks had diminished somewhat, and continuing strength in consumption suggested upside risks as well.  All members agreed that the predominant concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as desired.In light of the recent economic data and anecdotal information, the Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should acknowledge evidence of somewhat firmer economic growth and tentative signs of stabilization in the housing market.  They further agreed that the statement should reiterate that the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  The statement would also note the modest improvement in readings on core inflation and the Committee\\'s view that inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time.  The members discussed whether the balance of risks language in its recent statements still was the best way to represent the views of the Committee and decided that a change was not warranted at this time.  All members agreed that the statement should continue to stress that some inflation risks remained and note that additional policy firming was possible.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/4 percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p.m.:\"The Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\"Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke and Geithner, Ms. Bies, Messrs. Hoenig, Kohn, and Kroszner, Ms. Minehan, Messrs. Mishkin, Moskow, Poole, and Warsh.Votes against this action: None.The Committee then moved on to a discussion of the role of economic projections in policy communications.  Meeting participants reviewed the objectives, advantages, and disadvantages of potential changes to the production and communication of policymakers\\' forecasts of key economic variables.  They expressed support for continuing to report summaries of their individual forecasts, which they now make twice a year and which are included in the Monetary Policy Report.  Participants agreed to explore whether changes to current practices might facilitate improved communication internally among themselves during the policy debate and externally by providing the public with additional context for understanding the Committee\\'s policy decisions.  No decisions on any such changes were made at this meeting, and a further discussion of communications topics was planned for the next FOMC meeting, confirmed for March 20-21, 2007.The meeting adjourned at 2:45 p.m.Notation VotesBy notation vote completed on December 29, 2006, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on December 12, 2006.By notation vote completed on January 5, 2007, the Committee unanimously selected William C. Dudley to serve at the pleasure of the Committee as Manager, System Open Market Account, on the understanding that his selection was subject to being satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Secretary\\'s note: Advice subsequently was received that the selection of Mr. Dudley as Manager was satisfactory to the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Vincent R.

Dotsey, Tallman, and Tootell, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Boston, respectivelyThe Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.By unanimous vote, the Committee extended for one year beginning in mid-December 2007 the reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Banco de Mexico.  The arrangement with the Bank of Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent and that with the Banco de Mexico is in the amount of $3 billion equivalent.  Both arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve\\'s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994.  The vote to renew the System\\'s participation in the swap arrangements maturing in December was taken at this meeting because of the provision that each party must provide six months\\' prior notice of an intention to terminate its participation.  The information reviewed at the May meeting suggested that economic activity had expanded at a below-trend pace in recent months.  Gains in payroll employment had moderated, and the unemployment rate appeared to have stabilized after a period of decline.  Housing construction remained under pressure from weak demand and large inventories of unsold homes, and consumer spending appeared to have slowed in recent months.  Business fixed investment remained subdued.  Manufacturing production, however, showed signs of strengthening after a period of considerable softness.  Rising energy prices pushed up total PCE price inflation in March, while the twelve-month increase in core PCE prices was just slightly above its year-earlier pace. The average monthly increase in payroll employment through the first four months of this year was well below the relatively strong pace recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006.  In April, the construction industry continued to shed jobs, manufacturing employment declined further, and retailers reduced hiring after a large gain in March.  The unemployment rate stood at 4.5 percent in April, similar to its average in the first quarter, and the labor force participation rate moved down.Industrial production increased at a modest annual rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter, with the monthly pattern reflecting fluctuations in the output of utilities, which was influenced importantly by swings in weather conditions.  Manufacturing output declined, on net, over the six months ending in February as a result of inventory-related adjustments in a number of industries.  However, factory production turned up in March.  The output of high-tech industries rose briskly; the production of consumer goods increased; and the output of business equipment, construction supplies, and materials picked up.  The limited information available on industrial production for April suggested that output had been boosted by the scheduled pickup in motor vehicle assemblies.Real consumer expenditures increased at a brisk pace in the first quarter, although monthly gains in spending slowed over the course of the quarter, in part because of swings in weather-related outlays on energy goods and energy services.  Retail sales of both autos and light trucks moved up in the first quarter, but eased a bit in April.  Real spending on goods other than motor vehicles, which had shown exceptional vigor late last year, was broadly flat between December and March.  However, outlays on non-energy services were reported to have posted solid gains, especially in March.  Real disposable personal income rose smartly in the first quarter.  Wages and salaries increased solidly, on average, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that income in January was boosted by unusually large bonus payments and stock option exercises.  The household wealth-to-income ratio likely ticked down in the first quarter, as the stock market rose only a little and house prices remained soft.  However, given the surge in stock prices in April, much of the lost ground had probably since been made up.  Residential construction activity remained soft as builders attempted to work off elevated inventories of unsold new homes.  Single-family housing starts moved up in March, almost certainly boosted by unusually warm and dry weather; single-family permit issuance also increased.  Although existing home sales declined in March, the level of sales was only slightly below the steady pace that had prevailed in the second half of 2006.  By contrast, new home sales fell sharply in the first two months of the year and had recovered only a bit in March.  All told, recent readings on home sales suggested that housing demand had weakened further.  House-price appreciation continued to slow, and some measures were again showing declines in home values.Real spending on equipment and software rose modestly in the first quarter after having fallen in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Spending on high-tech equipment, boosted by a surge in outlays on computers, posted a substantial increase in the first quarter.  In addition, purchases of communications equipment--which tend to be volatile quarter to quarter--rebounded strongly after a fourth-quarter dip.  By contrast, spending on transportation equipment declined significantly:  Although domestic spending on aircraft jumped after three weak quarters, purchases of medium and heavy trucks dropped sharply, largely as a consequence of a pull-forward of truck purchases in the latter part of last year in anticipation of the tighter emissions standards that took effect in January.  Business investment in equipment other than high-tech and transportation dropped in the first quarter, although the weakness in this broad category appeared to have been especially pronounced around the turn of the year and to have lessened somewhat over the course of the quarter.  Robust corporate cash reserves and continuing declines in the user cost of high-tech goods remained supportive of equipment and software spending going forward.  Real outlays for nonresidential construction regained some momentum in the first quarter of this year after having hit a lull in late 2006.  Real nonfarm inventory investment excluding motor vehicles increased at a slower pace in the first quarter of 2007 than in the previous quarter.  The downshift in inventory investment had helped to reduce the apparent overhangs that had emerged in late 2006.  In the motor vehicle sector, the sharp decline in the pace of assemblies over the past few quarters appeared to have brought inventories back into line with sales.  In April, surveys indicated that the net number of firms who viewed their customers\\' inventory levels as too high had dropped back from elevated readings over the previous two quarters.The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in February, reflecting a steep drop in imports, which more than offset a sizable decline in exports.  Within imports, the value of oil imports plunged, reflecting decreases in both prices and quantities, and imports of industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive parts also fell.  The lion\\'s share of the February decline in exports was of capital goods.  Smaller decreases occurred in exports of industrial supplies, consumer goods, and services.Economic activity in advanced foreign economies appeared to have grown at a steady rate in the first part of the year.  Canada\\'s growth seemed to have rebounded from a disappointing fourth quarter.  Renewed household demand in Japan pointed to further strong growth in the first quarter, while investment demand seemed to be underpinning growth in the United Kingdom.  Although euro-area exports had slowed from the rapid pace set in the fourth quarter and the hike in the German value-added tax likely depressed consumption, overall economic conditions remained solid.  Economic activity in the emerging market countries appeared to have continued to advance at a robust pace in the first quarter.  Surging growth in China was a highlight of the strong performance of most countries in Asia.  In Latin America, indicators pointed to further lackluster growth in Mexico and some weakening in Argentina, but in other countries, especially Brazil, conditions appeared more positive.The total PCE price index rose substantially in both February and March.  The advance in February was distributed across a broad range of categories, while the March increase was driven largely by a jump in the index for energy.  Core PCE prices were unchanged in March after an upswing in February.  Smoothing through the high-frequency movements, the twelve-month change in the core PCE price index in March was just a touch higher than the increase over the year-earlier period.  Accelerations in the costs of housing and medical services were major contributors to both core CPI and core PCE inflation over the past year.  Household surveys conducted in April indicated that the median expectation for year-ahead inflation had moved up, consistent with the recent pickup in headline CPI inflation.  Median expectations of longer-term inflation had edged higher but were still in the narrow range seen over the past few years.  Average hourly earnings for production or nonsupervisory workers, which had accelerated noticeably over the past couple of years, posted moderate increases in March and April.At its March meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) maintained its target for the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent.  The Committee\\'s accompanying statement noted that recent economic indicators had been mixed and that the adjustment in the housing sector was ongoing.  Nevertheless, the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  Recent readings on core inflation had been somewhat elevated. Although inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain those pressures.  The Committee\\'s predominant policy concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected.  Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. Market participants had largely anticipated the FOMC\\'s decision at its March meeting to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged.  Nevertheless, the expected path for monetary policy moved lower on the announcement, as investors apparently interpreted the accompanying statement as suggesting that the Committee\\'s economic outlook had become somewhat more balanced.  However, subsequent FOMC communications--including the Chairman\\'s testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, speeches by various FOMC members, and the minutes from the March meeting--were generally seen as emphasizing the Committee\\'s concern about upside risks to inflation.  Over the intermeeting period, yields on nominal Treasury securities edged up at all maturities.  Measures of inflation compensation based on inflation-indexed Treasury securities were little changed despite a significant rise in oil prices.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds rose in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, leaving their spreads little changed at fairly low levels.  Spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed.  Equity prices climbed steeply amid solid earnings reports and improved sentiment, more than reversing the declines in the previous intermeeting period.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies moved lower, on balance.Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial businesses slowed from its torrid first-quarter pace in April, but acquisition-related financing continued to fuel the issuance of both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds.  Commercial paper outstanding declined, but bank lending accelerated.  In the household sector, the rise in home mortgage debt likely slowed a bit further in the first quarter, as home-price appreciation appeared to have remained sluggish.  Consumer credit continued to expand at a moderate pace early in the year.  M2 accelerated during March and April, primarily reflecting faster growth in liquid deposits, which were likely boosted in April by tax-related flows.In its forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff expected the pace of economic activity to pick up from weak first-quarter growth to a rate a little below that of the economy\\'s long-run potential for the remainder of this year and to increase at a pace broadly in line with potential output in 2008.  The projected gradual acceleration in economic activity largely reflected the expected waning of the drag from residential investment, although recent readings on sales and inventories of new homes had been interpreted by the staff as suggesting that the ongoing contraction in residential investment would continue for longer than previously expected.  In response to data received over the past year, the staff had marked down slightly its estimate of structural productivity growth and nudged up its estimate for the increase in labor supply--leaving its estimate of the overall growth of potential GDP broadly unchanged.  The increases in energy and other commodity prices over the intermeeting period had led the staff to revise up its forecast for headline PCE inflation during the first half of the year.  Nonetheless, the staff continued to expect core inflation to edge lower over the course of the next two years.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, participants noted that their assessments of the medium-term prospects for economic growth and inflation had not changed materially from the previous meeting.  The pace of economic expansion had slowed in the first part of this year, but the recent sub-par performance probably exaggerated the weakness of underlying demand, and the rate of economic growth was expected to pick up in coming quarters.  Meeting participants anticipated that real GDP would advance at a pace a little below the economy\\'s trend rate of growth through the remainder of this year and then pick up to a rate broadly in line with the economy\\'s trend rate in 2008.  Most participants continued to expect core inflation to slow gradually, although considerable uncertainty surrounded that judgment and the Committee\\'s predominant concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected. The incoming data on new home sales and inventories suggested that the ongoing adjustment in the housing market would probably persist for longer than previously anticipated.  In particular, the demand for new homes appeared to have weakened further in recent months, and the stock of unsold homes relative to sales had increased sharply.  That said, participants also noted that sales of existing homes appeared to have held up somewhat better since the beginning of the year.  Moreover, the turmoil in the subprime market evidently had not spread to the rest of the mortgage market; indeed, mortgage rates available to prime borrowers remained well below their levels of last summer.  Nevertheless, most participants agreed that, although the level of inventories of unsold homes that homebuilders desired was uncertain, the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year--somewhat longer than previously expected.  Growth in consumer spending appeared to have slowed over the past few months.  Real spending on goods had flattened out, and contacts in both the retail sector and the consumer credit sector reported a softening in the expansion of demand.  In contrast to the rapid gains of recent years, meeting participants expected household expenditure to grow at a more moderate pace in coming quarters.  Consumption was likely to be supported by continued advances in employment and incomes, as well as gains in stock prices; but the recent increases in gasoline prices probably would damp households\\' spending power in the near term, and the effect of the anticipated leveling out in home-price appreciation on household wealth was expected to contribute to a gradual increase in the personal saving rate over the medium run.  Participants remained concerned that the housing market correction could have a more pronounced impact on consumer spending than currently expected, especially if house prices were to decline significantly.  The growth of business fixed investment seemed most likely to move higher in coming quarters, supported by strong corporate balance sheets and profits, favorable financial conditions, and a gradual strengthening in business output.  The downside risks to business capital spending appeared to have diminished somewhat since the previous meeting.  In particular, participants took note of the upturn in orders and shipments of capital goods, and of more upbeat surveys of business conditions.  However, participants cautioned against drawing too much comfort from the most recent few data observations, and recognized that the current sluggishness of equipment outlays could persist for longer than currently anticipated, especially if financial market conditions became less supportive.  Participants were also encouraged that, outside of the construction sector, the correction of inventories to more comfortable levels appeared well advanced, thus reducing the possibility that going forward this adjustment process could trigger shortfalls in business spending and output.Economic activity in the rest of the world continued to advance briskly.  Participants noted that strong foreign expansion should help to underpin demand for U.S. exports, but expressed some concern that the strength of global demand could contribute to price pressures at home.  Prices of non-energy commodities, especially metals, had moved up markedly since the previous meeting.  Moreover, inflationary pressures in a number of overseas economies appeared to have increased of late, perhaps partly in response to heightened levels of capacity utilization in those countries, and this development had the potential to add to the prices of U.S. imports.  In that regard, several participants noted that the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar over the intermeeting period could reinforce the upward pressure on import prices. Participants discussed how best to reconcile the slowdown in output growth over the past year with the relatively strong performance of the labor market.  This apparent tension could partly reflect measurement issues; in particular, participants noted that the more-rapid gains in estimates of gross domestic income over this period might better capture the pace of activity than the modest advances in measured GDP.  Aside from measurement problems, a possible explanation was that these differing trends largely related to the lagged adjustment of employment to the slowing pace of expansion.  In that regard, several participants observed that the recent moderation in economic growth had been concentrated in the construction sector, but that measured employment in construction had not yet declined by a corresponding amount.  This suggested that increases in overall employment in coming quarters may possibly be held down by notable declines in construction employment as the adjustment of the labor force in that sector played out.  A slowing in employment could then occur in conjunction with a strengthening in productivity growth.  Alternatively, some of the recent weakness in measured productivity growth could reflect a decline in the underlying trend in productivity and so might persist.  Although this explanation might help account for some of the downshift in measured productivity growth, participants agreed that there appeared to be little other evidence pointing to a significant slowing of advances in structural productivity.  In the context of this discussion, many participants commented that their view of potential output growth was somewhat more optimistic than that of the staff. Labor markets appeared to remain relatively tight.  Unemployment continued around the low levels seen since last fall, and many business contacts reported difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified workers, especially for certain types of professional and skilled positions.  However, several participants observed that aggregate measures of labor compensation had so far increased only modestly, perhaps suggesting that the labor market might be less stretched than it appeared.  Moreover, even if wages and salaries did accelerate, the resulting cost pressures might be absorbed by a narrowing in firms\\' profit margins from current elevated levels, rather than being passed on in the form of higher prices.  On the other hand, some participants reported that their business contacts appeared very resistant to any squeeze in profit margins.  All told, for most participants, the apparent tightness of the labor market remained a significant source of upside risk to inflation. Nearly all participants viewed core inflation as remaining uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.  Although readings on core inflation in March had been more favorable, this followed several months of elevated inflation data and price pressures were not yet viewed as convincingly on a downward trend.  Most participants expected core inflation to moderate gradually, fostered in part by stable inflation expectations and a likely deceleration in shelter costs.  Some participants also expected the anticipated slight easing of pressures on resources to help nudge inflation lower, although others felt that small movements in resource utilization were unlikely to have discernible effects on inflation.  All participants agreed that the risks around the anticipated moderation in inflation were to the upside; and some noted that a failure of inflation to moderate could entail significant costs particularly if it led to an upward drift in inflation expectations.In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  Recent developments were seen as supporting the Committee\\'s view that maintaining the current target rate was likely to foster moderate economic growth and a gradual ebbing in core inflation.  Members continued to view the risks to economic activity as weighted to the downside, although with turmoil in the subprime market appearing to have remained relatively well contained and business spending indicators suggesting a more encouraging outlook, these downside risks were judged to have diminished slightly.  Members agreed that considerable uncertainty attended the prospects for inflation, and the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as desired remained the Committee\\'s predominant concern.In light of the recent economic data and anecdotal information, the Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should acknowledge that economic growth had slowed in the first part of the year.  The Committee thought that the statement should reiterate the view that the adjustment in the housing market was ongoing, but that nevertheless the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  While readings on core inflation were lower in March, members felt that it was appropriate to emphasize that core inflation remained somewhat elevated.  The Committee agreed that the statement should continue to note that their predominant policy concern was the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected, and that future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\\t\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial \\tconditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable \\tgrowth in output.

Attended portion of the meeting relating to monetary policy communications. 2. Attended portion of the meeting relating to the economic outlook and monetary policy discussion.The information  reviewed at the June meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity  rebounded in the second quarter from its subpar pace in the first quarter.\\xa0 Upswings in net exports and inventory  investment were expected to contribute importantly to the rise in real  GDP.\\xa0 Consumer spending appeared to have  slowed from its rapid pace earlier in the year, while business fixed investment  continued to rise at a modest rate.\\xa0  Residential construction remained weak as builders worked further to  clear high inventories of unsold homes.\\xa0  Sharp increases in energy prices drove up overall inflation in April and  appeared to have done so again in May; core inflation seemed to have remained  subdued. Employment continued  to rise at a moderate pace; the average monthly increase in payroll employment  in April and May was a little below that of the first quarter.\\xa0 In May, employment was boosted by strong  hiring in the service sector, but the manufacturing and retail sectors  continued to shed jobs.\\xa0 Larger payrolls  and a slightly longer average workweek in May led to an increase in aggregate  hours; the unemployment rate held steady at 4.5 percent. Industrial  production increased modestly in April and May after having been little changed  in the first quarter when some manufacturers restrained production to cope with  a buildup in inventories.\\xa0 Manufacturing  output edged up in recent months, reflecting increases in the output of light  motor vehicles, other consumer durable goods, construction supplies, and  durable materials.\\xa0 The production of  high-tech industries also rose, albeit at a relatively sluggish pace compared  with the brisk expansion seen around the turn of the year.\\xa0 Capacity utilization in the manufacturing  sector in May was close to its long-run average and slightly below its level  one year earlier. The pace of real  consumer spending appeared to have slowed somewhat in the second quarter after substantial  increases late last year and early this year.\\xa0  The deceleration primarily reflected a flattening out of outlays for  goods in recent months; spending on services continued to rise at a solid pace  for the quarter as a whole, although the monthly pattern was affected by  weather-related swings in outlays on energy services.\\xa0 The determinants of household spending were  broadly supportive.\\xa0 Real disposable  personal income rose at a moderate pace, on average, in the first four months  of the year, boosted not only by ongoing gains in wages and salaries, but also  by unusually large bonus payments and stock option exercises in the first  quarter.\\xa0 Although the household  wealth-to-income ratio ticked down in the first quarter with the stock market  up only a little and house prices remaining soft, the increase in stock prices  in the second quarter likely made up much of the lost ground.Elevated inventories  of unsold new homes continued to weigh on residential construction  activity.\\xa0 In May, single-family housing  starts declined, and adjusted permit issuance for the single-family sector  stepped down further, indicating that builders were intending to slow further the  pace of new construction.\\xa0 The monthly  readings on sales of new and existing homes through May had fluctuated around  levels lower than the average over the second half of 2006.\\xa0 Some, though not all, of this weakening in  home sales was likely related to the tightening of lending standards for  nonprime borrowers that began in February.\\xa0  Even though the inventory of new homes for sale ticked down in May, the  months’ supply in May remained noticeably above its level in late 2006. \\xa0According to OFHEO’s purchase-only price index  for existing homes, house-price appreciation continued to slow in the first  quarter. Outlays for nonresidential  construction appeared to have remained robust early in the second quarter.\\xa0 Business spending on equipment and software in  recent months appeared to be about unchanged from the first quarter, although  the softness was largely confined to outlays for transportation equipment.\\xa0 Shipments and orders for items other than  transportation moved up markedly in March and April after weakness in earlier  months, and, even with the small declines in May, the data pointed to a healthy  rise in outlays in the second quarter.\\xa0  In particular, real spending on equipment other than high-tech and  transportation seemed to be rebounding after sizable declines over the previous  two quarters.\\xa0 After a surge in outlays  on computers in the first quarter, spending on high-tech equipment appeared to  be rising at a more modest pace in April and May.\\xa0 In contrast, spending on transportation  equipment declined significantly.\\xa0  Purchases of medium and heavy trucks dropped further in May, continuing  to reflect the payback from sales that were pulled forward into 2005 and 2006  in anticipation of tighter emissions standards that took effect in  January.\\xa0 New orders for trucks picked up  in May, albeit from very low levels.\\xa0  Shipments data indicated that spending on aircraft dropped back from the  elevated level in the first quarter.\\xa0 The  downtrend in the cost of capital was likely curtailed in recent weeks by the rise  in corporate bond rates.\\xa0 Nonetheless,  firms retained ample cash in reserve to finance investment.\\xa0   \\xa0  Real nonfarm  inventory investment excluding motor vehicles slowed appreciably in the first  quarter of 2007, as firms in most industries appeared to have made considerable  progress in addressing the inventory overhangs that developed in 2006.\\xa0 The adjustment apparently continued into the  second quarter, as the ratio of inventories to sales for manufacturing and  trade excluding motor vehicles ticked down further in April after a March  decline.\\xa0 Inventories of light motor  vehicles, which were pared down to more comfortable levels during the first  quarter, continued to edge lower through May.\\xa0  Indeed, the inventory adjustment reached the point that, for the third  month in a row, the May survey of purchasing managers indicated that, on net,  more firms viewed their customers’ inventory levels as too low rather than too  high.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 After no change between the fourth quarter and first quarter,  the U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in April from its March level.\\xa0 The recent narrowing reflected a steep  decline in many categories of goods  imports and a modest increase in exports,  especially of agricultural products.\\xa0  Nominal imports of petroleum were flat in April after surging in March  despite steady increases in the price of imported oil.Economic activity in advanced foreign economies appeared to  have grown at a solid rate in the first quarter.\\xa0 Economic growth in Canada rebounded sharply  from a disappointing fourth quarter, and growth picked up in the United Kingdom,  owing primarily to a robust expansion in the service sector.\\xa0 In the euro area, export growth in the first  quarter slowed from its rapid fourth-quarter pace, and the hike in the German  value-added tax likely temporarily depressed first-quarter consumption growth \\xa0\\xa0Consumer spending showed signs of recovering  in recent months, and overall, economic conditions in the euro area remained  solid.\\xa0 In Japan, recent data suggested  that growth in the second quarter had moderated from the vigorous first-quarter  pace, with public spending and net exports likely sources of weakness.\\xa0 Recent data indicated that economic activity  in emerging-market economies remained strong.\\xa0  Growth in China and India appeared to have moderated somewhat from the  very high rates of the first quarter.\\xa0 In  Latin America, indicators for Mexico suggested some recovery from the marked slowdown of the previous few quarters, while growth in Argentina and Brazil  appeared to pick up as well.  \\xa0  Headline consumer  price inflation stepped up in recent months, driven by large increases in the  index for energy.\\xa0 However, readings on  core inflation had declined.\\xa0 Core PCE  prices rose 0.1\\xa0percent in April and were estimated to have posted a  similar, modest increase in May.\\xa0 The  recent readings had been held down, in part, by declines in volatile categories  such as apparel and tobacco products that were likely to prove transitory; the  rent components had also decelerated. \\xa0The twelve-month change in core PCE prices in  May was expected to be lower than the increase over the year-earlier period;  however, over that longer period, the decline in core PCE inflation was almost  entirely the result of a slowing in its nonmarket component.\\xa0 Household surveys conducted in early June  indicated that the median expectation for year-ahead inflation increased  further, consistent with the energy-driven acceleration in overall consumer  prices in recent months.\\xa0 After edging  higher in April and May, median expectations of longer-term inflation fell back  in June and remained in the narrow range seen over the past two years.\\xa0 The twelve-month change in average hourly  earnings for production or nonsupervisory workers edged lower in recent months.  \\xa0  At its May meeting,  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) maintained its target for the federal  funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.\\xa0 The  Committee’s accompanying statement noted that economic growth slowed in the  first part of the year and that the adjustment in the housing sector was  ongoing.\\xa0 Nevertheless, the economy  seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.\\xa0 Core inflation remained somewhat elevated.\\xa0 Although inflation pressures seemed likely to  moderate over time, the high level of resource utilization had the potential to  sustain those pressures.\\xa0 The Committee's  predominant policy concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to  moderate as expected. \\xa0Future policy  adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and  economic growth, as implied by incoming information.Market participants  had largely anticipated the FOMC's decision at its May meeting to leave the  target federal funds rate unchanged, but some market participants were  reportedly surprised by the retention of the assessment that inflation was  “somewhat elevated.”\\xa0 The publication of  the minutes of the May meeting elicited little market response.\\xa0 Over the intermeeting period, however,  investors seemed to reappraise their beliefs that the economic expansion would  slow and that monetary policy easing would be forthcoming.\\xa0 This reappraisal seemed to be based in part  on the release of some economic data in the United    States and abroad that were more favorable  than expected.\\xa0 As a result, the expected  path of the federal funds rate over the coming year was marked up sharply in  financial markets.\\xa0 Yields on nominal  Treasury securities at all maturities also rose over the intermeeting period,  with the most pronounced gains in forward rates three to five years ahead.\\xa0 Measures of long-horizon inflation  compensation based on inflation-indexed Treasury securities edged slightly higher.\\xa0 Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds  rose in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, leaving  their spreads little changed.\\xa0 In  contrast, spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed. \\xa0Equity prices were volatile at times during  the intermeeting period, but broad stock price indexes advanced modestly, on  net, as favorable news on the economy and announcements of mergers and  acquisitions outweighed the drag of higher bond yields.\\xa0 The foreign exchange value of the dollar  against other major currencies was little changed, on balance.  \\xa0  Gross bond issuance  by nonfinancial businesses surged in May from the already robust pace of  earlier in the year.\\xa0 Acquisition-related  financing continued to support corporate bond issuance, but a significant share  of recent issues was reportedly designated for capital expenditures.\\xa0 Commercial paper outstanding was unchanged in  May, but bank lending maintained a strong pace.\\xa0  In the household sector, mortgage debt expanded at a slower pace in the  first quarter, reflecting the slowdown in home-price appreciation over the past  year and the lower pace of home sales.\\xa0  Interest rates available to prime borrowers on both fixed-rate and  variable-rate mortgages increased along with other market interest rates.\\xa0 Consumer credit continued to expand at a  moderate pace in the first quarter.\\xa0 After  rising at a particularly rapid rate in the first quarter, M2 increased at a  more moderate pace in April and May.In preparation for  this meeting, the staff reduced its estimate of the increase in real GDP in the  first quarter and marked up its forecast of the rebound in economic activity in  the second quarter, in large part because of a more substantial swing in  inventory investment than previously expected.\\xa0  The revisions, however, left the projection of economic growth over the  first half of the year unchanged.\\xa0 As was  the case in May, economic activity was expected to increase at a rate a little  below that of the economy's long-run potential for the remainder of the year  and to rise at a pace broadly in line with potential output growth in 2008. \\xa0The projected gradual acceleration in economic  activity in coming quarters largely reflected the expected waning of the drag  from residential investment and improvements in the pace of business fixed  investment. \\xa0Increases in energy and food  prices over the intermeeting period led the staff to revise up its forecast for  headline PCE inflation during the second quarter, but its projection of core PCE  inflation was revised down.\\xa0 Although  some of the recent slowing in readings on core PCE inflation was likely due to  transitory factors, the staff took some signal from the data and trimmed its  forecast for core PCE inflation slightly in coming quarters.\\xa0 Over the next several quarters, total PCE inflation  was projected to moderate to a pace close to core PCE inflation.  \\xa0  In their discussion  of the economic situation and outlook, participants noted that economic activity  appeared to have expanded at a moderate pace on balance over the first half of  the year. \\xa0In view of incoming data and  anecdotal information, participants continued to anticipate moderate economic  growth in coming quarters, with growth rising gradually to a pace close to that  of potential output.\\xa0 Participants  interpreted the most recent information on business spending, business  sentiment, and the labor market as suggesting that the risks to growth were  more balanced than at the time of the May meeting, despite the ongoing  adjustment in the housing sector and the significant recent increases in longer-term  interest rates.\\xa0 Participants generally  expected that inflation would probably edge lower over the next two years,  reflecting the waning of temporary factors that had boosted prices last year  and a slight easing of pressures on resources.\\xa0  Recent data on core consumer prices were encouraging in this regard, but  participants were wary of drawing any firm conclusions about future trends from  a few monthly readings that could reflect transitory influences and remained  concerned about forces that could contribute to inflation pressures. \\xa0Against this backdrop, participants agreed  that the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected remained their  predominant concern.In preparation for  the Federal Reserve’s semiannual report to the Congress on the economy and  monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of  the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of  nominal and real GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price  inflation for the years 2007 and 2008, conditioned on their views of the  appropriate path for monetary policy.\\xa0  The projections for the growth of nominal GDP were in the range of 4-1/2  to 5-1/2 percent, with a central tendency of 4-1/2 to 5 percent for 2007; for  2008, the projections for nominal GDP growth ranged between 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 with  a central tendency of 4-3/4 to 5 percent.\\xa0  Projections for the rate of expansion in real GDP in 2007 were in a  range from 2 to 2-3/4 percent in 2007, with a central tendency of 2-1/4 to  2-1/2 percent; for 2008, the projections ranged between 2-1/2 to 3 percent,  with a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent.\\xa0 These rates of growth were associated with  civilian unemployment rates in the range of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent in the  fourth quarter of 2007 and 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008;  the central tendency of these projections was 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent in 2007  and about 4-3/4 percent in 2008.\\xa0  Projections for the rate of inflation, as measured by the core PCE price  index, in 2007 were in a range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent in 2007 and 1-3/4 to 2 percent  in 2008.\\xa0 The central tendencies of these  projections in 2007 and 2008 were identical to the ranges for those years.  \\xa0  Participants  generally agreed that the housing sector was likely to remain a drag on growth  for some time yet and represented the most significant downside risk to the  economic outlook.\\xa0 Although starts of  single-family homes had moved up, on balance, over recent months, permits for  new construction continued to decline.\\xa0 A  number of participants noted that inventories of new homes for sale remained  quite elevated.\\xa0 Housing activity was  seen as likely to continue to contract for several more quarters.\\xa0 Participants also identified a number of  downside risks associated with their outlook for residential construction.\\xa0 The recent increase in interest rates for  prime mortgages could further dampen the demand for housing.\\xa0 Moreover, a number of participants pointed to  rising mortgage delinquency rates and related difficulties in the subprime  mortgage market as factors that could crimp the availability of mortgage credit  and the demand for housing.\\xa0 \\xa0Spillovers from the  strains in the housing market to consumption spending had apparently been quite  limited to date.\\xa0 To be sure, personal  consumption expenditures appeared to be rising more slowly in recent months  than earlier in the year, but that development was probably, at least in part,  a result of the rise in gasoline prices, which was not expected to be  extended.\\xa0 Participants generally  anticipated moderate gains in consumption spending over coming months,  supported by the strong labor market and solid growth in personal income.\\xa0 Still, the advance in spending was expected to  fall short of income growth, and the saving rate was anticipated to trend  higher over coming quarters from the unusually low levels of recent years.\\xa0 Some participants noted a risk that the  saving rate could rise more than currently foreseen, particularly if household  wealth were depressed by a further softening in house prices or by a less  buoyant equity market that might accompany a potential slowing in the growth of  corporate earnings.\\xa0 Several participants  noted that higher interest rates and a potential tightening in credit  availability might also be factors that could contribute to a rise in the  personal saving rate.\\xa0 At the same time,  participants recognized that consumption growth had held up to date and saw a  risk that the saving rate could fail to rise as much as currently expected,  particularly if equity markets continued to register significant gains.\\xa0   \\xa0  A number of  participants remarked that the recent data on business spending were more  encouraging than those available at the time of the May meeting.\\xa0 In particular, orders and shipments for  nondefense capital goods had stepped up, on balance, from March through May,  and survey indicators of business conditions had improved of late. \\xa0Strength in foreign demand for U.S.  goods and services was another factor that seemed likely to contribute to the  firming of business spending.\\xa0  Participants noted that inventories appeared to be better aligned with  sales, boding well for a resumption of inventory accumulation and a pickup in  manufacturing activity.\\xa0 At the same  time, some recognized the possibility that downside risks to investment  spending persisted.\\xa0 Longer-term interest  rates and the cost of credit generally had moved higher of late, the growth of  business profits seemed to be moderating, and measured productivity growth had  been slower.\\xa0 Although credit market  conditions seemed to remain generally quite accommodative, in the days just  prior to the meeting, the availability of credit to some highly leveraged and  other lower-rated borrowers appeared to be tightening a bit and investors seemed  to reevaluate the risks associated with investments in complex and illiquid  financial instruments.  \\xa0  Strength in spending  abroad and the decline in the exchange value of the dollar were seen as factors  boosting U.S.  exports.\\xa0 The rise in global interest  rates was cited as evidence of increasing global demand, and some participants pointed  to strength of aggregate demand worldwide and its potential effect on the  prices of imports and globally traded commodities as contributing to upside  risks to U.S. inflation.Most participants  judged labor market conditions to remain rather tight, particularly for the  most skilled workers.\\xa0 The continued  tautness of labor markets was something of a puzzle in light of below-trend  economic growth over recent quarters, and this development seemed to be  connected with slower productivity growth lately.\\xa0 In their discussion of this issue,  participants noted that employment data for 2006 could ultimately be revised  down, resulting in a corresponding upward revision to productivity.\\xa0 Some participants also pointed to evidence of  lags in employment adjustments, particularly in the construction industry, as a  factor depressing productivity in recent quarters.\\xa0 These observations suggested that the recent decline  in productivity growth might prove smaller than now estimated and largely  transitory.\\xa0 Still, some decline in the  pace of trend productivity growth could not be ruled out--a development that  could have implications for business costs and price pressures.\\xa0 Some participants further noted that the  level of the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation could be lower  than previously thought--a possibility that would help to explain the absence of  outsized wage pressures in the current environment.  \\xa0  The incoming data on  core consumer prices were viewed as favorable, but were not seen as convincing evidence  that the recent moderation of core inflation would be sustained. \\xa0Participants noted that monthly data on  consumer prices are noisy, and recent readings on core inflation seemed to have  been depressed by transitory factors. \\xa0Moreover, a number of forces could sustain  inflation pressures, including the generally high level of resource  utilization, elevated energy and commodity prices, the decline in the exchange  value of the dollar over recent quarters, and slower productivity growth.\\xa0 In addition, while core consumer price  inflation had moderated of late, total consumer price inflation had moved  substantially higher, boosted by rising energy and food prices.\\xa0 While total inflation was expected to slow  toward the pace of core inflation over time, a number of participants noted  that recent elevated readings posed some risk of a deterioration in inflation  expectations.\\xa0 On this point, several  participants cited the uptick in forward measures of inflation compensation  over the intermeeting period derived from Treasury inflation-indexed  securities.\\xa0 However, a portion of this  increase might be attributed to technical factors, and survey measures of  long-term inflation expectations had held steady over recent weeks.\\xa0 Nonetheless, several participants emphasized  that holding long-run inflation expectations at or below current levels would  likely be necessary for core inflation to moderate as expected over coming  quarters.   \\xa0  In their discussion  of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, members generally regarded the  risks to economic growth as more balanced than at the time of the May  meeting.\\xa0 Although the housing market  remained a key source of uncertainty about the outlook, members thought it most  likely that the overall economy would expand at a moderate pace over coming  quarters.\\xa0 Members generally anticipated  that core inflation would remain relatively subdued but concurred that a  sustained moderation in inflation had not yet been convincingly demonstrated.\\xa0 In these circumstances, members agreed that  maintaining the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent for this meeting was  appropriate and that future policy adjustments would depend on the outlook for  economic growth and inflation, as implied by incoming information. In light of the recent  economic data and anecdotal information, the Committee agreed that the  statement to be released after the meeting should indicate that the economy  seemed to be expanding at a moderate pace over the first half of the year.\\xa0 Members agreed that while measures of core  inflation had improved lately, the statement should indicate that a sustained  moderation of inflation remained in question and that high levels of resource  utilization had the potential to fuel inflation pressures.\\xa0 Against this backdrop, members judged that  the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected remained their  predominant concern.At the conclusion of  the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York, until it was  instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in  accordance with the following domestic policy directive:“The Federal Open Market Committee  seeks monetary and financial     conditions that will foster price  stability and promote sustainable     growth in output.\\xa0 To further its long-run objectives, the  Committee     in the immediate future seeks  conditions in reserve markets consistent     with maintaining the federal funds  rate at an average of around     5-1/4 percent.” The vote  encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be  released at 2:15 p.m.:“In these  circumstances, the Committee’s predominant policy concern     remains the risk  that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.\\xa0 Future     policy  adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming  information.”\\xa0 \\xa0Votes for this action: \\tMessrs.

Rosengren as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee had been  received and that he had executed his oath of office. By unanimous vote, the Federal Open Market Committee  selected Brian F. Madigan to serve as Secretary and Economist until the  selection of a successor at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the  Committee in 2008.The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange  markets. There were no open market  operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since  the previous meeting. The Manager also  reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open  market operations in government securities and federal agency obligations  during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions. The information reviewed at the  August meeting suggested that economic activity picked up in the second quarter  from the slow pace in the first quarter.  On average, the economy expanded at a moderate pace during the first half  of the year despite the ongoing drag from the housing sector. While the growth of consumer spending slowed  in the second quarter from its rapid pace in prior quarters, wages and salaries  increased solidly and household sentiment appeared supportive of further gains  in spending. Business fixed investment  picked up in the second quarter after little net change in the preceding two  quarters. Inventories generally appeared  to be well aligned with sales at midyear.  Overall inflation receded in June because of a decline in energy prices,  while the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index rose a bit  less than its average pace over the past year.Private nonfarm payroll employment  continued to increase at a healthy pace; the rise in July was about equal to  the average increase over the first half of the year. Solid hiring in the service sector was partly  offset by declines in construction and manufacturing employment. Most of the drop in construction employment  occurred in jobs typically associated with nonresidential construction. Both the average workweek and aggregate hours  ticked down in July. The unemployment  rate edged up to 4.6 percent; it had remained between 4.4 percent and 4.6  percent since September 2006.Industrial production picked up in  the second quarter after little net change over the preceding two  quarters. The increase was largely  attributable to a smaller drag from inventory liquidation and a modest  improvement in net exports.  Manufacturing production rose solidly in the second quarter because of  substantial increases in the output of light motor vehicles, other durable  consumer goods, business equipment, construction supplies, and materials. Production in high-tech industries rose  relatively modestly in comparison to its longer-run growth. The growth of real consumer  spending slowed considerably in the second quarter after substantial increases  earlier in the year. The deceleration  primarily reflected sharply slower growth in outlays for goods as purchases of  motor vehicles decreased noticeably.  Although a spike in energy prices eroded real income growth in the  second quarter, there were solid gains in wages and salaries. Despite continued softness in house prices,  household wealth moved markedly higher in the second quarter, mostly reflecting  rising equity prices. Demand for housing in the second  quarter was restrained by higher interest rates and by tightening credit  conditions in the subprime mortgage market.  Sales of new and existing homes in the second quarter were down  substantially from their average levels in the second half of 2006. In June, single-family housing starts held  steady at their May rate, although adjusted permit issuance slipped  further. The combination of decreased  sales and unchanged production left inventories of new homes for sale still  elevated. House-price appreciation  continued to slow, with some measures again showing declines in home values.Outlays for nonresidential  construction rose rapidly in the second quarter. Business spending on equipment and software,  other than transportation equipment, posted a solid increase after being flat,  on net, in the preceding two quarters. The  rise was led by a rebound in purchases of industrial machinery. Expenditures for computers, software, and  communications equipment grew moderately in the second quarter after a brisk  first-quarter increase. Spending on  transportation equipment again declined sharply. The drop was largely a continuation of the payback  from exceptionally strong purchases of heavy trucks in 2005 and 2006 in  anticipation of tighter emissions standards on diesel engines. New orders for medium and heavy trucks edged  up in the second quarter, though they remained at low levels, suggesting that  the downturn in business spending on motor vehicles may be ending.Real nonfarm inventory investment was a roughly neutral  influence on real GDP growth in the second quarter after having held down the growth  rate by an average of 1 percentage point in the previous two quarters. Businesses made considerable progress in reducing  the apparent inventory overhangs that had emerged at the end of 2006. In the motor vehicle sector, low rates of  assemblies in the first half of this year left inventories of domestic light  vehicles at the end of the second quarter fairly well aligned with sales;  however, inventories rose again in July as production accelerated and sales  remained weak. More broadly, the number  of purchasing managers who viewed their customers\\' inventory levels as too high  in July only slightly exceeded the number who saw them as too low.The U.S.  international trade deficit widened in May, as a rise in imports more than  offset an increase in exports. Within  imports, most categories of goods recorded an increase, as did services. The value of oil imports rose sharply,  boosted by a jump in the price of imported oil. The increase in exports was largely  attributable to capital goods, including aircraft, computers and  semiconductors, and industrial supplies.Economic activity in advanced  foreign economies expanded somewhat less rapidly in the second quarter than in  the prior quarter, but nonetheless appeared to have grown faster than trend,  reflecting upbeat business and consumer confidence as well as favorable labor  market conditions. Although many of those  economies recently experienced sharp declines in equity prices and widening  credit spreads amid deepening concerns about credit quality, these developments  occurred too late in the intermeeting period to have any apparent effect on  incoming data. In Japan,  survey evidence suggested that its economy expanded moderately. Survey evidence indicated high levels of  economic sentiment and strong capital spending plans among large manufacturers. In the euro area, survey measures of business  and consumer confidence remained near record highs in July, and labor market  conditions generally continued to improve in May and June. In the United    Kingdom, real GDP growth rose in the second  quarter, an increase driven mainly by robust expansion in the service  sector. Canada\\'s  growth seemed to continue to pick up from its disappointing rate posted in much  of last year.Recent data indicated that economic  activity in emerging-market economies remained generally strong. The Chinese economy continued to expand at a  rapid pace, and activity elsewhere in emerging Asia  appeared to have accelerated. In Latin   America, Mexican indicators pointed to a weaker-than-expected  rebound in the second quarter, whereas Brazil  and Argentina  appeared to have experienced solid growth.  While equity prices fell and bond spreads widened in several  emerging-market economies, particularly in Latin America,  there was no evidence that this increased volatility had yet weighed on economic  activity. U.S.  headline consumer price inflation slowed in June as energy prices flattened out  after a rapid increase over the preceding three months. Core PCE prices rose 0.1 percent in June, as  a decline in the price index for core goods nearly offset a rise in the index  for core services. The readings on core  PCE price inflation in recent months had been held down, in part, by declines  in prices of some categories of goods, such as apparel, that tend to be  volatile on a monthly basis. Household  surveys conducted in early July indicated that the median expectation for  inflation over the next year remained unchanged from June\\'s elevated level  despite declines in gasoline prices in both months. Median expectations of longer-term inflation ticked  up and were near the top of the narrow range that had prevailed over the past  few years. The employment cost index  rose somewhat faster in the second quarter than over the preceding three  months, and the twelve-month change was slightly higher than that of a year  ago.At its June meeting, the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC) maintained its target for the federal funds rate  at 5-1/4 percent. The statement announcing  the policy decision noted that economic growth appeared to have been moderate  during the first half of the year, despite the ongoing adjustment in the  housing sector. The economy seemed  likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. Readings  on core inflation had improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation  pressures had yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource  utilization had the potential to sustain those pressures. The Committee\\'s predominant policy concern  remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments would depend on the  evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by  incoming information.Market participants had largely  anticipated the FOMC\\'s decision at its June meeting to leave the target for the  federal funds rate unchanged, although the accompanying statement expressed  greater concern about inflation than investors reportedly had foreseen and  caused the expected path for the federal funds rate to edge higher. Expectations for a policy easing diminished  somewhat more in the wake of favorable economic news early in the period. Subsequently, the semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress and the accompanying testimony, which reported lower projections for real GDP  growth than investors apparently expected, appeared to prompt a downward shift  in investors\\' expected path for the federal funds rate. Later in the intermeeting period, growing  apprehension that turmoil in markets for subprime mortgages and some low-rated  corporate debt might have adverse effects on economic growth led investors to  mark down their expectations for the future path of policy considerably further. At the same time, measures of long-horizon  inflation compensation based on inflation-indexed Treasury securities edged  down. Financial market conditions were  volatile during the intermeeting period, particularly over the last few weeks  of the interval. Yields on nominal  Treasury securities fell on balance, possibly reflecting an increased  preference by investors for safe assets as well as revisions in policy  expectations. Conditions in markets for subprime  mortgages and related instruments, including segments of the asset-backed  commercial paper market, deteriorated sharply toward the end of the  period. Credit conditions for  speculative-grade corporate borrowers tightened substantially, as investors  pulled back from higher-risk assets.  Spreads on speculative-grade bonds increased to near their highest  levels in the past four years. A number  of high-yield bond and leveraged loan deals intended to finance leveraged  buyouts were delayed or restructured, though other high-yield bonds were  issued. In contrast, credit conditions  for investment-grade businesses and prime households were relatively little  affected by the market turbulence. Issuance  of investment-grade bonds continued.  Yields on investment-grade corporate issues rose relative to yields on  Treasury securities, but because yields on Treasuries declined, yields on  investment-grade bonds were about unchanged on net. Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding  posted a modest gain in July, while the pace of bank lending to businesses  picked up from an already solid clip. Mortgage  loans and consumer credit appeared to remain readily available to households  with strong balance sheets, although late in the period some evidence pointed  to diminishing availability of jumbo mortgages. Broad stock price indexes declined  substantially, on net, over the intermeeting period despite generally solid  second-quarter earnings reports. Share  prices of financial firms fell especially sharply, reportedly a reflection, in  part, of concerns about exposures to subprime mortgages and about the effect of  a potential slowdown in merger activity on operating profits. The foreign exchange value of the dollar  against other major currencies fell, on balance.Growth of home mortgage debt likely  slowed again in the second quarter, mainly reflecting the decline in home-price  appreciation over the past year and the drop in home sales. Overall consumer credit expanded moderately  through the year ending in May. The debt  of nonfinancial businesses expanded at a robust pace in the second quarter but  slowed in July. After rising at a rapid  pace in the first half of the year, M2 grew at a more moderate rate in  July. In preparation for this meeting,  the staff lowered somewhat its forecast of real GDP growth in the second half  of 2007 and in 2008. The reduction was  in part due to the annual revision of national income and product accounts  (NIPA), which revealed somewhat less rapid growth in output and productivity  during the past three years than previously reported and led the staff to trim  its estimates of the growth rates of structural productivity and potential GDP;  the reduction also reflected less accommodative financial conditions and the  softer tone of some near-term indicators.  The near-parallel revisions to the forecasts for potential and actual  GDP left the staff\\'s projections for resource utilization about unchanged. Although part of the recent favorable monthly  readings on core PCE price changes was expected to be transitory, the staff  revised down slightly its forecast for core PCE price inflation in the second  half of 2007; however, in light of slower growth in structural productivity and  prospects of somewhat greater pressure from import prices, the staff left its projection  for core PCE inflation unchanged for 2008.  Overall PCE inflation was expected to slow in the second half of 2007  from the elevated pace of the first half, as the effects of the sizable  increases in food and energy prices earlier this year abated, and then to move  down a bit further in 2008.In their discussion of the economic  situation and outlook, meeting participants indicated that they still saw  moderate economic expansion in coming quarters as the most likely outcome but  that the downside risks to growth had increased. Participants reported that economic expansion  had continued at a moderate pace in many regions of the country despite further  weakness in the housing sector. Going  forward, most participants anticipated that growth in aggregate demand would be  supported by rising employment, incomes, and exports, with the result that  growth in actual output probably would remain close to growth of potential GDP despite  the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector. Several mentioned that the  revisions to the NIPA pointed to a modest downward adjustment in projected  growth of actual and potential GDP, but thought that potential output growth  was likely to be a bit higher than forecast by the staff. However, recent spending indicators had been  mixed, and credit conditions had become tighter, suggesting greater downside  risks to growth. Participants generally  expected that core inflation would edge lower over the next two years,  reflecting a slight easing of pressures on resources, well-anchored inflation  expectations, and the waning of temporary factors that had boosted prices last  year and early this year. Participants anticipated that total inflation  would slow as well, particularly if market expectations of a modest decline in  energy prices in coming quarters were to prove correct. But they were concerned that the high level  of resource utilization and slower productivity growth could augment inflation  pressures. Against this backdrop, the  Committee agreed that the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as  expected remained its predominant policy concern.Participants agreed that  the housing sector was apt to remain a drag on growth for some time and  represented a significant downside risk to the economic outlook. Indeed, developments in mortgage markets  during the intermeeting period suggested that the adjustment in the housing  sector could well prove to be both deeper and more prolonged than had seemed  likely earlier this year. Participants  noted that investors had become much more uncertain about the likely future  cash flows from subprime and certain other nontraditional mortgages, and thus about  the valuation of securities backed by such mortgages. Consequently, the markets for securities  backed by subprime and other non-traditional mortgages had become illiquid, and  originations of new subprime mortgages had dropped sharply. While these markets were expected to recover over  time, it was anticipated that credit standards for these types of mortgages  would be tighter, and interest rates higher relative to rates on conforming  mortgages, in the future than in recent years.  However, participants also observed that mortgage loans remained readily  available to most potential borrowers, and that interest rates on conforming,  conventional mortgage loans had declined in recent weeks, providing some  support to the housing sector. Participants thought  that consumer expenditures likely would expand at a moderate pace in coming  quarters, supported by solid gains in employment and real income. Though  growth in consumer spending had slowed in the second quarter, the slowing likely  reflected temporary factors in part, including some payback from unusually  strong growth in prior quarters and the surge in gasoline prices. Several participants noted the risks that  house prices could decline significantly and that credit standards for home  equity loans could be tightened substantially as factors that could weigh on consumer  spending. However, the sizable upward  revision--from negative to positive--in estimates of the personal saving rate  during the past three years suggested somewhat less need for households to  rebuild their savings. Participants expected that  business investment would be supported by solid fundamentals, including high  profits, strong business balance sheets, and moderate growth in output. Recent financial market developments were  thought unlikely to have an appreciable adverse effect on capital spending. Although lenders recently appeared to be less  willing to extend credit for financial restructuring, the supply of credit to  finance real investment did not appear significantly diminished. Funding had become more costly and difficult  to obtain for riskier corporate borrowers, but there had been little net change  in the cost of credit for investment-grade businesses. Also, businesses in the aggregate continued  to have sufficient internally generated funds to finance the expected level of real  investment. Nonetheless, participants recognized  that conditions in corporate credit markets could change rapidly, and that  adverse effects on business spending were possible. Moreover, heightened asset market volatility  and the associated increase in uncertainty, if they were to persist for long, could  lead businesses to pare capital spending plans. Still, participants judged that continued  growth of investment outlays going forward was the most likely outcome. Rapid economic growth abroad and the decline in the  foreign exchange value of the dollar in recent quarters were seen as likely to boost  U.S. exports  and thus support the economic expansion.  Some participants also anticipated that growth in government purchases  of goods and services would support continued growth in output.The data on core inflation  received during the intermeeting period were favorable, but meeting participants  believed that the readings for the past few months likely had been damped by transitory  factors and did not provide reliable evidence that the recent level would be  sustained. Still, participants thought that a slight decrease in pressures  on resources and the stability of inflation expectations likely would foster over  time a gradual moderation in core inflation.  Participants anticipated that total inflation would slow as well,  particularly if market expectations for a modest decline in energy prices in  coming quarters were to prove correct. Participants  remained concerned about factors that could augment inflation pressures,  including the continuing high level of resource utilization and slower trend  growth in productivity. Some also pointed  to the strength of aggregate demand worldwide and the depreciation of the  dollar, and their potential effects on the prices of imports and globally  traded commodities, as contributing to upside risks to U.S.  inflation. Several participants noted significant  increases in wages in their Districts, particularly in the service sector, but  it was also observed that that overall gains in labor compensation had remained  moderate, suggesting that sustainable rates of resource utilization could be  slightly higher than typically estimated.  On balance, participants continued to agree that risks to the outlook  for sustained moderation in inflation pressures remained tilted to the upside.In their discussion of monetary policy for the  intermeeting period, Committee members again agreed that maintaining the  existing stance of policy at this meeting was likely to be consistent with the  overall economy expanding at a moderate pace over coming quarters and inflation  pressures moderating over time. The  expansion would be supported by solid job gains and rising real incomes that  would bolster consumption, and by increasing foreign demand for goods and  services produced in the United States.  The ongoing adjustment in housing markets likely would exert a restraining  influence on overall growth for several more quarters and remained a key source  of uncertainty about the outlook. The  recent strains in financial markets posed additional downside risks to economic  growth. Members expected a return to more  normal market conditions, but recognized that the process likely would take  some time, particularly in markets related to subprime mortgages. However, a further deterioration in financial  conditions could not be ruled out and, to the extent such a development could  have an adverse effect on growth prospects, might require a policy response. Policymakers would need to watch the  situation carefully. For the present,  however, given expectations that the most likely outcome for the economy was continued  moderate growth, the upside risks to inflation remained the most significant policy  concern. In these circumstances, members  agreed that maintaining the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this  meeting was appropriate.   In light of the recent economic data, anecdotal  information, and financial market developments, the Committee agreed that the  statement to be released after the meeting should indicate that economic growth  was moderate during the first half of the year and that the economy seemed  likely to continue to expand moderately in coming quarters, supported by solid  growth in employment and incomes and by robust economic growth abroad. Members also agreed that the statement should  incorporate their view that downside risks to growth had increased somewhat, and  should mention volatile financial markets, tighter credit conditions for some  households and businesses, and the ongoing correction in the housing market. In addition, the Committee agreed that the  statement should again note that readings on core inflation had improved modestly  in recent months but did not yet convincingly demonstrate a sustained  moderation of inflation pressures, and that the high level of resource  utilization had the potential to sustain inflation pressures. Against  this backdrop, members judged that the risk that inflation would fail to  moderate as expected continued to outweigh other policy concerns.   At the conclusion of  the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York, until it was  instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in  accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee  seeks monetary and financial     conditions that will foster price  stability and promote sustainable     growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the  Committee     in the immediate future seeks  conditions in reserve markets consistent    with maintaining the federal funds  rate at an average of around     5-1/4 percent.\" The vote encompassed approval of  the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p.m.:\"Although the downside risks to growth have  increased somewhat, the     Committee\\'s predominant policy concern remains  the risk that inflation     will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend     on the outlook for both inflation and economic  growth, as implied by     incoming information.\"Votes for this action: Messrs.

Return to textIn the agenda for this meeting, it was reported that advices of the election of Charles L. Evans as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee had been received and that he had executed his oath of office.By unanimous vote, the Federal Open Market Committee selected James A. Clouse and Daniel G. Sullivan to serve as Associate Economists until the selection of their successors at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee in 2008.The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market operations in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at the September meeting suggested that economic activity advanced at a moderate rate early in the third quarter.  After expanding at a robust pace in July, retail sales rose at a somewhat slower rate in August.  Orders and shipments of capital goods posted solid gains in July.  However, residential investment weakened further, even before the recent disruptions in mortgage markets.  In addition, private payrolls posted only a small gain in August, and manufacturing production decreased after gains in the previous two months.  Meanwhile, core inflation rose a bit from the low rates observed in the spring but remained moderate through July.Private nonfarm payroll employment rose only modestly in August, and the levels of employment in June and July were revised down.  The weakness in employment was spread fairly widely across industries.  Residential construction and manufacturing posted noticeable declines in jobs, employment in wholesale trade and transportation was little changed, and hiring at business services was well below recent trends.  Both the average workweek and aggregate hours were unchanged in August.  The unemployment rate held steady at 4.6 percent, 0.1 percentage point above its second-quarter level and equal to its 2006 average.After posting solid gains in June and July, total industrial production edged up only a bit in August.  This increase was attributable to a surge in electricity generation, as temperatures swung from mild in July to very warm in August.  After large gains in the preceding two months, manufacturing output declined in August, held down by a decrease in the production of motor vehicles and parts.  High-tech output rose only modestly in August, but production gains in June and July were revised up considerably.Consumer spending appeared to have strengthened early in the summer from its subdued second-quarter pace.  Although auto sales were weak in July, real outlays for other goods rose briskly.  At the same time, spending on services was up moderately despite a drop in outlays for energy associated with relatively cool weather in the eastern part of the United States.  In August, consumption appeared to have posted another solid gain.  Although nominal retail sales outside the motor vehicle sector were about flat (abstracting from a drop in nominal sales at gasoline stations associated with falling gas prices), vehicle sales stepped up and warmer weather likely caused an increase in energy usage.  Real disposable income rose further in July, as wages and salaries posted a strong gain and energy prices came down.  However, household wealth likely was providing a diminishing impetus to the pace of spending, reflecting recent declines in stock market wealth and an apparent further deceleration in house prices.  Readings on consumer sentiment turned down in August after having risen in July, and the Reuters/Michigan index remained near its relatively low August level in early September.The housing sector remained exceptionally weak.  Home sales had dropped considerably this year: Sales of new and existing single-family homes in July were down substantially from their averages over the second half of last year.  Demand was restrained by deteriorating conditions in the subprime mortgage market and by an increase in rates for thirty-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages.  In the nonconforming mortgage market, the availability of financing to borrowers recently appeared to have been crimped even further.  Most forward-looking indicators of housing demand, including an index of pending home sales, pointed to a further deterioration in sales in the near term.  Single-family starts slid in July to their lowest reading since 1996, and adjusted permit issuance continued on a downward trajectory.  Although single-family housing starts had come down substantially from their peak, the drop had lagged the decline in demand, and as a result, inventories of new homes had risen considerably.  In the multifamily sector, starts in July were in line with readings thus far this year and at the low end of the fairly narrow range seen since 1997.  Meanwhile, house prices generally continued to decelerate.Orders and shipments of capital goods posted a strong gain early in the third quarter.  In particular, orders and shipments of equipment outside the high-tech and transportation sector registered a robust increase in July, and data on computer production and shipments of high-tech goods pointed to solid increases in business demand for high-tech.  In contrast, indicators of spending for transportation equipment were mixed.  Aircraft shipments in July and public information on Boeing\\'s deliveries suggested that domestic spending on aircraft was retreating somewhat in the current quarter.  While fleet sales of light vehicles appeared to have moved up in July and August, sales of medium and heavy trucks remained below the second-quarter average.  More generally, surveys of business conditions suggested that increases in business activity were somewhat slower in August than in the second quarter.Book-value data for the manufacturing and trade sectors excluding motor vehicles and parts suggested that inventory accumulation stepped down noticeably in July from the second-quarter pace.  Inventories of light motor vehicles rose again in July and August.  The number of manufacturing purchasing managers who viewed their customers\\' inventory levels as too low in August slightly exceeded the number who saw them as too high.The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in July, as exports increased more than imports.  Sharp increases in exports of both aircraft and automobiles contributed importantly to the overall gain.  Exports of agricultural products and consumer goods were also strong.  In contrast, exports of industrial supplies and semiconductors exhibited declines.  The value of imported goods and services was boosted by a large increase in imports of automotive products.  Higher imports of capital goods excluding aircraft, computers, and semiconductors and of oil also contributed to the overall gain in imports.Economic growth slowed in the second quarter in most advanced foreign economies, except the United Kingdom.  The step-down was most pronounced in Japan, where GDP contracted, but was also substantial in the euro area, where total domestic demand rose only slightly.  Although growth remained robust in Canada, data late in the quarter, including retail sales, indicated a more significant weakening in activity.  This softness appeared to have continued into the third quarter in some economies.  In July, indicators for Europe generally moderated, on balance, from their second-quarter levels; those for Canada and Japan, however, slowed more notably.  Most of the readings available on economic developments after August 9, when financial turmoil intensified, were measures of confidence.  They dropped, on average, but otherwise were consistent with the indicators reported for July.Data through July suggested that economic activity in emerging-market countries remained robust.  Output in the Asian economies soared in the second quarter, and several countries posted growth at or near double-digit rates.  In Latin America, output in Mexico and Venezuela rebounded sharply from earlier weakness.  Indicators for China in July pointed to only a modest slowing of output growth from its torrid pace in the first half of the year.  The scant data for August received thus far provided little indication that the turmoil in financial markets had a significant negative impact on real economic activity in emerging-market economies.After rapid price increases earlier this year, U.S. headline consumer price inflation was moderate in both June and July.  Although food prices continued their string of sizable increases, energy prices fell in June and July and gasoline prices appear to have dropped further in August.  Core PCE prices rose 0.2 percent in June and 0.1 percent in July.  On a twelve-month-change basis, core PCE inflation in July was below the comparable rate twelve months earlier.  Step-downs in price inflation for prescription drugs, motor vehicles, and nonmarket services accounted for nearly all of the deceleration in core PCE prices.  Although owners\\' equivalent rent decelerated over the past year, this change was largely offset by an acceleration in tenants\\' rent and lodging away from home.  Household surveys indicated that the median expectation for year-ahead inflation declined in August and edged down further in early September to a level only slightly above the reading at the turn of the year; the median expectation of longer-term inflation in early September remained in the range seen over the past couple of years.  The producer price index for core intermediate materials rose only modestly in July.  Compensation per hour decelerated in the second quarter.  Nonetheless, the increase over the four quarters ending in the second quarter was noticeably above the increase in the preceding four quarters and well above the rise in the employment cost index over the same period.At its August meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  In the statement, the Committee acknowledged that financial markets had been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions had become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction was ongoing.  The Committee reiterated its view that the economy seemed likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.  Readings on core inflation had improved modestly in recent months.  However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures had yet to be convincingly demonstrated.  Moreover, the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain these pressures.  Although the downside risks to growth had increased somewhat, the Committee repeated that its predominant policy concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected.  Future policy adjustments would depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.  The FOMC\\'s policy decision and the accompanying statement were about in line with market expectations, and reactions in financial markets were muted.In the days after the August FOMC meeting, financial market participants appeared to become more concerned about liquidity and counterparty credit risk.  Unsecured bank funding markets showed signs of stress, including volatility in overnight lending rates, elevated term rates, and illiquidity in term funding markets.  On August 10, the Federal Reserve issued a statement announcing that it was providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly functioning of financial markets.  The Federal Reserve indicated that it would provide reserves as necessary through open market operations to promote trading in the federal funds market at rates close to the target rate of 5-1/4 percent.  The Federal Reserve also noted that the discount window was available as a source of funding.On August 17, the FOMC issued a statement noting that financial market conditions had deteriorated and that tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty had the potential to restrain economic growth going forward.  The FOMC judged that the downside risks to growth had increased appreciably, indicated that it was monitoring the situation, and stated that it was prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.  Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve Board announced that, to promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets, it had approved a 50 basis point reduction in the primary credit rate to 5-3/4 percent.  The Board also announced a change to the Reserve Banks\\' usual practices to allow the provision of term financing for as long as thirty days, renewable by the borrower.  In addition, the Board noted that the Federal Reserve would continue to accept a broad range of collateral for discount window loans, including home mortgages and related assets, while maintaining existing collateral margins.  On August 21, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced some temporary changes to the terms and conditions of the SOMA securities lending program, including a reduction in the minimum fee.  The effective federal funds rate was somewhat below the target rate for a time over the intermeeting period, as efforts to keep the funds rate near the target were hampered by technical factors and financial market volatility.  In the days leading up to the FOMC meeting, however, the funds rate traded closer to the target.Short-term financial markets came under pressure over the intermeeting period amid heightened investor unease about exposures to subprime mortgages and to structured credit products more generally.  Rates on asset-backed commercial paper and on low-rated unsecured commercial paper soared, and some issuers, particularly asset-backed commercial paper programs with investments in subprime mortgages, found it difficult to roll over maturing paper.  These developments led several programs to draw on backup lines, exercise options to extend the maturity of outstanding paper, or even default.  As a result, asset-backed commercial paper outstanding contracted substantially.  Investors sought the safety and liquidity of Treasury securities, and yields on Treasury bills dropped sharply for a period; trading conditions in the bill market were impaired at times.  Meanwhile, banks took measures to conserve their liquidity and were cautious about counterparties\\' exposures to asset-backed commercial paper.  Term interbank funding markets were significantly impaired, with rates rising well above expected future overnight rates and traders reporting a substantial drop in the availability of term funding.  Pressures eased a bit in mid-September, but short-term financial markets remained strained.Conditions in corporate credit markets were mixed.  Investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond spreads edged up; they were near their highest levels in four years, although they remained far below the peaks seen in mid-2002.  Investment-grade bond issuance was strong in August as yields declined, but issuance of speculative-grade bonds was scant.  Speculative-grade bond deals and leveraged loans slated to finance leveraged buyouts continued to be delayed or restructured.  Bank lending to businesses surged in August, apparently because some banks funded leveraged loans that they had intended to syndicate to institutional investors and perhaps because some firms substituted bank credit for commercial paper.  Although markets for nonconforming mortgages were impaired over the intermeeting period, the supply of conforming mortgages seemed to have been largely unaffected by recent developments.  Broad stock price indexes were volatile but about unchanged, on net, over the intermeeting period.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies fell, on balance.Investors appeared to mark down significantly their expected path for the federal funds rate during the intermeeting period, evidently in response to the strains in money and credit markets and a few key data releases, including weaker-than-expected reports on housing activity and employment.  Yields on nominal Treasury securities fell appreciably across the term structure.  TIPS-based inflation compensation at the five-year horizon was about unchanged, while inflation compensation at longer horizons crept higher.Growth of nonfinancial domestic debt was estimated to have slowed a little in the third quarter from the average pace in the first half of the year.  The deceleration in total nonfinancial debt reflected a projected slowdown in borrowing across all major sectors of the economy excluding the federal government.  Although it decelerated in the third quarter, business-sector debt continued to advance at a solid pace, boosted by a surge in business loans.  In the household sector, mortgage borrowing was estimated to have slowed notably, as mortgage interest rates moved up, nonconforming mortgages became harder to obtain, and as home sales slowed and house prices decelerated.  M2 increased at a brisk pace in August.  The rise was led by a surge in liquid deposits and in retail money funds as investors adjusted their portfolios in response to the turmoil in financial markets.In preparation for this meeting, the staff continued to estimate that real GDP increased at a moderate rate in the third quarter.  However, the staff marked down the fourth-quarter forecast, reflecting a judgment that the recent financial turbulence would impose restraint on economic activity in coming months, particularly in the housing sector.  The staff also trimmed its forecast of real GDP growth in 2008 and anticipated a modest increase in unemployment.  Softer demand for homes amid a reduction in the availability of mortgage credit would likely curtail construction activity through the middle of next year.  Moreover, lower housing wealth, slower gains in employment and income, and reduced confidence seemed likely to restrain consumer spending in 2008.  Despite the recent difficulties in some corporate credit markets, financial conditions confronting most nonfinancial businesses did not appear to have tightened appreciably to date.  But going forward, the staff anticipated that businesses would scale back their capital spending a touch in response to financing conditions that were likely to become a little less accommodative and to more modest gains in sales.  With credit markets expected to largely recover over coming quarters, growth of real GDP was projected to firm in 2009 to a pace a bit above the rate of growth of its potential.  Incoming data on consumer price inflation that were slightly to the low side of the previous forecast, in combination with the easing of pressures on resource utilization in the current forecast, led the staff to trim slightly its forecast for core PCE inflation.  Headline PCE inflation, which was boosted by sizable increases in energy and food prices earlier in the year, was expected to slow in 2008 and 2009.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants focused on the potential for recent credit market developments to restrain aggregate demand in coming quarters.  The disruptions to the market for nonconforming mortgages were likely to reduce further the demand for housing, and recent financial developments could well lead to a more general tightening of credit availability.  Moreover, some recent data and anecdotal information pointed to a possible nascent slowdown in the pace of expansion.  Given the unusual nature of the current financial shock, participants regarded the outlook for economic activity as characterized by particularly high uncertainty, with the risks to growth skewed to the downside.  Some participants cited concerns that a weaker economy could lead to a further tightening of financial conditions, which in turn could reinforce the economic slowdown.  But participants also noted that the resilience of the economy in the face of a number of previous periods of financial market disruptions left open the possibility that the macroeconomic effects of the financial market turbulence would prove limited.Although financial markets were expected to stabilize over time, participants judged that credit markets were likely to restrain economic growth in the period ahead.  Given existing commitments to customers and the increased resistance of investors to purchasing some securitized products, banks might need to take a large volume of assets onto their balance sheets over coming weeks, including leveraged loans, asset-backed commercial paper, and some types of mortgages.  Banks\\' concerns about the implications of rapid growth in their balance sheets for their capital ratios and for their liquidity, as well as the recent deterioration in various term funding markets, might well lead banks to tighten the availability of credit to households and firms.  Tighter credit conditions were likely to weigh particularly on residential investment and to a lesser extent on other components of aggregate demand in coming quarters.  Meeting participants also noted that financial market conditions, while seeming to have improved somewhat in the most recent days, were still fragile and that further adverse credit market developments could well increase the downside risks to the economy.  Even after market volatility subsided and the recent strains eased, risk spreads probably would be wider and credit terms tighter than they had been a few months ago.  Although these developments would likely be consistent with longer-term financial stability, they were likely to exert some restraint on aggregate demand.In their discussion of individual sectors of the economy, participants noted that recent data suggested greater weakness in the housing market than had previously been expected.  Furthermore, recent financial developments had the potential to deepen further and prolong the downturn in the housing market, as subprime mortgages remained essentially unavailable, little activity was evident in the markets for other nonprime mortgages, and prime jumbo mortgage borrowers faced higher rates and tighter lending standards.  The faster pace of foreclosures as subprime mortgage rates reset was also seen as posing a downside risk to the housing market.  Nonetheless, participants observed that conforming mortgages remained readily available to creditworthy borrowers and that rates on these mortgages had declined in recent weeks.  Moreover, conditions in the jumbo mortgage market were expected to improve gradually over time.Although employment probably was not as weak as the most recent monthly data had suggested, trend growth in jobs had fallen off even prior to the recent financial market strains, and participants judged that some further slowing of employment growth was likely.  Indeed, financial services firms had already announced layoffs, largely reflecting mortgage market developments, the demand for temporary workers appeared to have softened, and the most recent weakening in construction employment was likely to continue for a while.  Moreover, if declines in house prices were to damp consumption, that could feed back on employment and income, exerting additional restraint on the demand for housing.  Nonetheless, to date, initial claims for unemployment insurance did not indicate a substantial and widespread weakening in labor demand, and labor markets across the country generally remained fairly tight, with several participants citing continued reports of shortages of labor from their contacts in some sectors.Participants thought that the most likely prospect was for consumer expenditures to continue to expand at a moderate pace on average over coming quarters, supported by growth in employment and income.  However, some participants saw indications of a possible weakening of consumer spending.  Sales of automobiles and building materials had flagged of late, and survey measures suggested that consumer confidence had been adversely affected by the recent financial market developments.  Also, a further tightening of terms for home equity lines of credit and second mortgages seemed possible, which could weigh on consumer spending, especially for consumer durables.Participants reported that recent financial market developments generally appeared to have had limited effects to date on business capital spending plans and expected that business investment was likely to remain healthy in coming quarters. The access of investment-grade corporate borrowers to credit so far remained unimpeded, and rates on investment-grade bonds had declined in recent weeks.  Moreover, participants noted that many capital expenditures were internally financed, making them less sensitive to credit market conditions.  Nonetheless, the pace of financing for lower-rated firms--including issuance of both speculative-grade bonds and leveraged loans--had slowed sharply over the summer.  Participants also noted that standards and terms for commercial real estate credit reportedly had tightened, and that credit availability for homebuilders could be trimmed going forward.  In addition, contacts indicated that business executives in parts of the country had apparently become somewhat more cautious and that some were delaying investment outlays in view of heightened economic and financial uncertainty.Some participants noted that foreign demand remained robust and net exports appeared strong.  Port utilization rates reportedly remained high.  Participants discussed the turbulence in foreign financial markets and noted that unusually high precautionary demand for dollar-denominated term funding in Europe had added to strains in U.S. interbank markets and contributed to a wide spread between libor and federal funds rates.Participants made only modest revisions to their outlook for inflation in the period since the Committee\\'s last regular meeting.  Still, they recognized that incoming data on core inflation continued to be favorable, and they generally were a little more confident that the decline in inflation earlier this year would be sustained.  Inflation expectations seemed to be contained, and the less robust economic outlook implied somewhat less pressure on resources going forward.  Participants nonetheless remained concerned about possible upside risks to inflation.  Higher benefit costs, rising unit labor costs more generally, reduced markups, and levels of resource utilization both in the United States and abroad that remained relatively high were all cited as factors that could contribute to inflationary pressures.  Inflation risks could be heightened if the dollar were to continue to depreciate significantly.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored an easing of the stance of monetary policy.  Members emphasized that because of the recent sharp change in credit market conditions, the incoming data in many cases were of limited value in assessing the likely evolution of economic activity and prices, on which the Committee\\'s policy decision must be based.  Members judged that a lowering of the target funds rate was appropriate to help offset the effects of tighter financial conditions on the economic outlook.  Without such policy action, members saw a risk that tightening credit conditions and an intensifying housing correction would lead to significant broader weakness in output and employment.  Similarly, the impaired functioning of financial markets might persist for some time or possibly worsen, with negative implications for economic activity.  In order to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the economy that might otherwise arise, all members agreed that a rate cut of 50 basis points at this meeting was the most prudent course of action.  Such a measure should not interfere with an adjustment to more realistic pricing of risk or with the gains and losses that implied for participants in financial markets.  With economic growth likely to run below its potential for a while and with incoming inflation data to the favorable side, the easing of policy seemed unlikely to affect adversely the outlook for inflation.The Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should indicate that the outlook for economic growth had shifted appreciably since the Committee\\'s last regular meeting but that the 50 basis point easing in policy should help to promote moderate growth over time.  They also agreed that the inflation situation seemed to have improved slightly and judged that it was no longer appropriate to indicate that a sustained moderation in inflation pressures had yet to be shown.  Nonetheless, all agreed that some inflation risks remained and that the statement should indicate that the Committee would continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.  Given the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook, the Committee decided to refrain from providing an explicit assessment of the balance of risks, as such a characterization could give the mistaken impression that the Committee was more certain about the economic outlook than was in fact the case.  Future actions would depend on how economic prospects were affected by evolving market developments and by other factors.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4-3/4  percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p.m.:\"Developments in financial markets since the Committee\\'s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.\"Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke, Geithner, Evans, Hoenig, Kohn, Kroszner, Mishkin, Poole, Rosengren, and Warsh.Votes against this action: None.The Committee then resumed its discussion of monetary policy communication issues.  Subsequently, in a joint session of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents discussed additional policy options to address strains in money markets.  No decisions were made in this session, but it was agreed that policymakers should continue to consider such options carefully.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, October 30-31, 2007.The meeting adjourned at 3:55 p.m.Notation VoteBy notation vote completed on August 27, 2007, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on August 7, 2007.Conference CallsOn August 10, 2007, the Committee reviewed developments in money and credit markets, where strains had worsened in the days since its last meeting.  Participants discussed the condition of domestic and foreign financial markets, the Open Market Desk\\'s approach to open market operations, possible adjustments to the discount rate, and the statement to be issued immediately after the conference call.On August 16, 2007, the Committee again met by conference call.  With financial market conditions having deteriorated further, meeting participants discussed the potential usefulness of various policy responses.  The discussion focused primarily on changes associated with the discount window that would be directed at improving the functioning of the money markets.  Most participants expressed strong support for taking such steps, although some concern was noted about the likely effectiveness of these measures and one participant also questioned their appropriateness.  In light of the risks posed to the economic outlook by the tighter credit conditions and the increased uncertainty in financial markets, the Committee felt that the downside risks to growth had increased appreciably, but that a change in the federal funds rate target was not yet warranted.  However, the situation bore close watching.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to approve the text below to be released the following morning:\"Financial market conditions have deteriorated, and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward. In these circumstances, although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace, the Federal Open Market Committee judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably. The Committee is monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.\"Votes for:  Messrs.

Return to textIn the agenda for this meeting, it was reported that advices of the election of Charles L. Evans as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee had been received and that he had executed his oath of office.By unanimous vote, the Federal Open Market Committee selected James A. Clouse and Daniel G. Sullivan to serve as Associate Economists until the selection of their successors at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee in 2008.The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market operations in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at the September meeting suggested that economic activity advanced at a moderate rate early in the third quarter.  After expanding at a robust pace in July, retail sales rose at a somewhat slower rate in August.  Orders and shipments of capital goods posted solid gains in July.  However, residential investment weakened further, even before the recent disruptions in mortgage markets.  In addition, private payrolls posted only a small gain in August, and manufacturing production decreased after gains in the previous two months.  Meanwhile, core inflation rose a bit from the low rates observed in the spring but remained moderate through July.Private nonfarm payroll employment rose only modestly in August, and the levels of employment in June and July were revised down.  The weakness in employment was spread fairly widely across industries.  Residential construction and manufacturing posted noticeable declines in jobs, employment in wholesale trade and transportation was little changed, and hiring at business services was well below recent trends.  Both the average workweek and aggregate hours were unchanged in August.  The unemployment rate held steady at 4.6 percent, 0.1 percentage point above its second-quarter level and equal to its 2006 average.After posting solid gains in June and July, total industrial production edged up only a bit in August.  This increase was attributable to a surge in electricity generation, as temperatures swung from mild in July to very warm in August.  After large gains in the preceding two months, manufacturing output declined in August, held down by a decrease in the production of motor vehicles and parts.  High-tech output rose only modestly in August, but production gains in June and July were revised up considerably.Consumer spending appeared to have strengthened early in the summer from its subdued second-quarter pace.  Although auto sales were weak in July, real outlays for other goods rose briskly.  At the same time, spending on services was up moderately despite a drop in outlays for energy associated with relatively cool weather in the eastern part of the United States.  In August, consumption appeared to have posted another solid gain.  Although nominal retail sales outside the motor vehicle sector were about flat (abstracting from a drop in nominal sales at gasoline stations associated with falling gas prices), vehicle sales stepped up and warmer weather likely caused an increase in energy usage.  Real disposable income rose further in July, as wages and salaries posted a strong gain and energy prices came down.  However, household wealth likely was providing a diminishing impetus to the pace of spending, reflecting recent declines in stock market wealth and an apparent further deceleration in house prices.  Readings on consumer sentiment turned down in August after having risen in July, and the Reuters/Michigan index remained near its relatively low August level in early September.The housing sector remained exceptionally weak.  Home sales had dropped considerably this year: Sales of new and existing single-family homes in July were down substantially from their averages over the second half of last year.  Demand was restrained by deteriorating conditions in the subprime mortgage market and by an increase in rates for thirty-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages.  In the nonconforming mortgage market, the availability of financing to borrowers recently appeared to have been crimped even further.  Most forward-looking indicators of housing demand, including an index of pending home sales, pointed to a further deterioration in sales in the near term.  Single-family starts slid in July to their lowest reading since 1996, and adjusted permit issuance continued on a downward trajectory.  Although single-family housing starts had come down substantially from their peak, the drop had lagged the decline in demand, and as a result, inventories of new homes had risen considerably.  In the multifamily sector, starts in July were in line with readings thus far this year and at the low end of the fairly narrow range seen since 1997.  Meanwhile, house prices generally continued to decelerate.Orders and shipments of capital goods posted a strong gain early in the third quarter.  In particular, orders and shipments of equipment outside the high-tech and transportation sector registered a robust increase in July, and data on computer production and shipments of high-tech goods pointed to solid increases in business demand for high-tech.  In contrast, indicators of spending for transportation equipment were mixed.  Aircraft shipments in July and public information on Boeing\\'s deliveries suggested that domestic spending on aircraft was retreating somewhat in the current quarter.  While fleet sales of light vehicles appeared to have moved up in July and August, sales of medium and heavy trucks remained below the second-quarter average.  More generally, surveys of business conditions suggested that increases in business activity were somewhat slower in August than in the second quarter.Book-value data for the manufacturing and trade sectors excluding motor vehicles and parts suggested that inventory accumulation stepped down noticeably in July from the second-quarter pace.  Inventories of light motor vehicles rose again in July and August.  The number of manufacturing purchasing managers who viewed their customers\\' inventory levels as too low in August slightly exceeded the number who saw them as too high.The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in July, as exports increased more than imports.  Sharp increases in exports of both aircraft and automobiles contributed importantly to the overall gain.  Exports of agricultural products and consumer goods were also strong.  In contrast, exports of industrial supplies and semiconductors exhibited declines.  The value of imported goods and services was boosted by a large increase in imports of automotive products.  Higher imports of capital goods excluding aircraft, computers, and semiconductors and of oil also contributed to the overall gain in imports.Economic growth slowed in the second quarter in most advanced foreign economies, except the United Kingdom.  The step-down was most pronounced in Japan, where GDP contracted, but was also substantial in the euro area, where total domestic demand rose only slightly.  Although growth remained robust in Canada, data late in the quarter, including retail sales, indicated a more significant weakening in activity.  This softness appeared to have continued into the third quarter in some economies.  In July, indicators for Europe generally moderated, on balance, from their second-quarter levels; those for Canada and Japan, however, slowed more notably.  Most of the readings available on economic developments after August 9, when financial turmoil intensified, were measures of confidence.  They dropped, on average, but otherwise were consistent with the indicators reported for July.Data through July suggested that economic activity in emerging-market countries remained robust.  Output in the Asian economies soared in the second quarter, and several countries posted growth at or near double-digit rates.  In Latin America, output in Mexico and Venezuela rebounded sharply from earlier weakness.  Indicators for China in July pointed to only a modest slowing of output growth from its torrid pace in the first half of the year.  The scant data for August received thus far provided little indication that the turmoil in financial markets had a significant negative impact on real economic activity in emerging-market economies.After rapid price increases earlier this year, U.S. headline consumer price inflation was moderate in both June and July.  Although food prices continued their string of sizable increases, energy prices fell in June and July and gasoline prices appear to have dropped further in August.  Core PCE prices rose 0.2 percent in June and 0.1 percent in July.  On a twelve-month-change basis, core PCE inflation in July was below the comparable rate twelve months earlier.  Step-downs in price inflation for prescription drugs, motor vehicles, and nonmarket services accounted for nearly all of the deceleration in core PCE prices.  Although owners\\' equivalent rent decelerated over the past year, this change was largely offset by an acceleration in tenants\\' rent and lodging away from home.  Household surveys indicated that the median expectation for year-ahead inflation declined in August and edged down further in early September to a level only slightly above the reading at the turn of the year; the median expectation of longer-term inflation in early September remained in the range seen over the past couple of years.  The producer price index for core intermediate materials rose only modestly in July.  Compensation per hour decelerated in the second quarter.  Nonetheless, the increase over the four quarters ending in the second quarter was noticeably above the increase in the preceding four quarters and well above the rise in the employment cost index over the same period.At its August meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  In the statement, the Committee acknowledged that financial markets had been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions had become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction was ongoing.  The Committee reiterated its view that the economy seemed likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.  Readings on core inflation had improved modestly in recent months.  However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures had yet to be convincingly demonstrated.  Moreover, the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain these pressures.  Although the downside risks to growth had increased somewhat, the Committee repeated that its predominant policy concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected.  Future policy adjustments would depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.  The FOMC\\'s policy decision and the accompanying statement were about in line with market expectations, and reactions in financial markets were muted.In the days after the August FOMC meeting, financial market participants appeared to become more concerned about liquidity and counterparty credit risk.  Unsecured bank funding markets showed signs of stress, including volatility in overnight lending rates, elevated term rates, and illiquidity in term funding markets.  On August 10, the Federal Reserve issued a statement announcing that it was providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly functioning of financial markets.  The Federal Reserve indicated that it would provide reserves as necessary through open market operations to promote trading in the federal funds market at rates close to the target rate of 5-1/4 percent.  The Federal Reserve also noted that the discount window was available as a source of funding.On August 17, the FOMC issued a statement noting that financial market conditions had deteriorated and that tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty had the potential to restrain economic growth going forward.  The FOMC judged that the downside risks to growth had increased appreciably, indicated that it was monitoring the situation, and stated that it was prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.  Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve Board announced that, to promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets, it had approved a 50 basis point reduction in the primary credit rate to 5-3/4 percent.  The Board also announced a change to the Reserve Banks\\' usual practices to allow the provision of term financing for as long as thirty days, renewable by the borrower.  In addition, the Board noted that the Federal Reserve would continue to accept a broad range of collateral for discount window loans, including home mortgages and related assets, while maintaining existing collateral margins.  On August 21, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced some temporary changes to the terms and conditions of the SOMA securities lending program, including a reduction in the minimum fee.  The effective federal funds rate was somewhat below the target rate for a time over the intermeeting period, as efforts to keep the funds rate near the target were hampered by technical factors and financial market volatility.  In the days leading up to the FOMC meeting, however, the funds rate traded closer to the target.Short-term financial markets came under pressure over the intermeeting period amid heightened investor unease about exposures to subprime mortgages and to structured credit products more generally.  Rates on asset-backed commercial paper and on low-rated unsecured commercial paper soared, and some issuers, particularly asset-backed commercial paper programs with investments in subprime mortgages, found it difficult to roll over maturing paper.  These developments led several programs to draw on backup lines, exercise options to extend the maturity of outstanding paper, or even default.  As a result, asset-backed commercial paper outstanding contracted substantially.  Investors sought the safety and liquidity of Treasury securities, and yields on Treasury bills dropped sharply for a period; trading conditions in the bill market were impaired at times.  Meanwhile, banks took measures to conserve their liquidity and were cautious about counterparties\\' exposures to asset-backed commercial paper.  Term interbank funding markets were significantly impaired, with rates rising well above expected future overnight rates and traders reporting a substantial drop in the availability of term funding.  Pressures eased a bit in mid-September, but short-term financial markets remained strained.Conditions in corporate credit markets were mixed.  Investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond spreads edged up; they were near their highest levels in four years, although they remained far below the peaks seen in mid-2002.  Investment-grade bond issuance was strong in August as yields declined, but issuance of speculative-grade bonds was scant.  Speculative-grade bond deals and leveraged loans slated to finance leveraged buyouts continued to be delayed or restructured.  Bank lending to businesses surged in August, apparently because some banks funded leveraged loans that they had intended to syndicate to institutional investors and perhaps because some firms substituted bank credit for commercial paper.  Although markets for nonconforming mortgages were impaired over the intermeeting period, the supply of conforming mortgages seemed to have been largely unaffected by recent developments.  Broad stock price indexes were volatile but about unchanged, on net, over the intermeeting period.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies fell, on balance.Investors appeared to mark down significantly their expected path for the federal funds rate during the intermeeting period, evidently in response to the strains in money and credit markets and a few key data releases, including weaker-than-expected reports on housing activity and employment.  Yields on nominal Treasury securities fell appreciably across the term structure.  TIPS-based inflation compensation at the five-year horizon was about unchanged, while inflation compensation at longer horizons crept higher.Growth of nonfinancial domestic debt was estimated to have slowed a little in the third quarter from the average pace in the first half of the year.  The deceleration in total nonfinancial debt reflected a projected slowdown in borrowing across all major sectors of the economy excluding the federal government.  Although it decelerated in the third quarter, business-sector debt continued to advance at a solid pace, boosted by a surge in business loans.  In the household sector, mortgage borrowing was estimated to have slowed notably, as mortgage interest rates moved up, nonconforming mortgages became harder to obtain, and as home sales slowed and house prices decelerated.  M2 increased at a brisk pace in August.  The rise was led by a surge in liquid deposits and in retail money funds as investors adjusted their portfolios in response to the turmoil in financial markets.In preparation for this meeting, the staff continued to estimate that real GDP increased at a moderate rate in the third quarter.  However, the staff marked down the fourth-quarter forecast, reflecting a judgment that the recent financial turbulence would impose restraint on economic activity in coming months, particularly in the housing sector.  The staff also trimmed its forecast of real GDP growth in 2008 and anticipated a modest increase in unemployment.  Softer demand for homes amid a reduction in the availability of mortgage credit would likely curtail construction activity through the middle of next year.  Moreover, lower housing wealth, slower gains in employment and income, and reduced confidence seemed likely to restrain consumer spending in 2008.  Despite the recent difficulties in some corporate credit markets, financial conditions confronting most nonfinancial businesses did not appear to have tightened appreciably to date.  But going forward, the staff anticipated that businesses would scale back their capital spending a touch in response to financing conditions that were likely to become a little less accommodative and to more modest gains in sales.  With credit markets expected to largely recover over coming quarters, growth of real GDP was projected to firm in 2009 to a pace a bit above the rate of growth of its potential.  Incoming data on consumer price inflation that were slightly to the low side of the previous forecast, in combination with the easing of pressures on resource utilization in the current forecast, led the staff to trim slightly its forecast for core PCE inflation.  Headline PCE inflation, which was boosted by sizable increases in energy and food prices earlier in the year, was expected to slow in 2008 and 2009.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants focused on the potential for recent credit market developments to restrain aggregate demand in coming quarters.  The disruptions to the market for nonconforming mortgages were likely to reduce further the demand for housing, and recent financial developments could well lead to a more general tightening of credit availability.  Moreover, some recent data and anecdotal information pointed to a possible nascent slowdown in the pace of expansion.  Given the unusual nature of the current financial shock, participants regarded the outlook for economic activity as characterized by particularly high uncertainty, with the risks to growth skewed to the downside.  Some participants cited concerns that a weaker economy could lead to a further tightening of financial conditions, which in turn could reinforce the economic slowdown.  But participants also noted that the resilience of the economy in the face of a number of previous periods of financial market disruptions left open the possibility that the macroeconomic effects of the financial market turbulence would prove limited.Although financial markets were expected to stabilize over time, participants judged that credit markets were likely to restrain economic growth in the period ahead.  Given existing commitments to customers and the increased resistance of investors to purchasing some securitized products, banks might need to take a large volume of assets onto their balance sheets over coming weeks, including leveraged loans, asset-backed commercial paper, and some types of mortgages.  Banks\\' concerns about the implications of rapid growth in their balance sheets for their capital ratios and for their liquidity, as well as the recent deterioration in various term funding markets, might well lead banks to tighten the availability of credit to households and firms.  Tighter credit conditions were likely to weigh particularly on residential investment and to a lesser extent on other components of aggregate demand in coming quarters.  Meeting participants also noted that financial market conditions, while seeming to have improved somewhat in the most recent days, were still fragile and that further adverse credit market developments could well increase the downside risks to the economy.  Even after market volatility subsided and the recent strains eased, risk spreads probably would be wider and credit terms tighter than they had been a few months ago.  Although these developments would likely be consistent with longer-term financial stability, they were likely to exert some restraint on aggregate demand.In their discussion of individual sectors of the economy, participants noted that recent data suggested greater weakness in the housing market than had previously been expected.  Furthermore, recent financial developments had the potential to deepen further and prolong the downturn in the housing market, as subprime mortgages remained essentially unavailable, little activity was evident in the markets for other nonprime mortgages, and prime jumbo mortgage borrowers faced higher rates and tighter lending standards.  The faster pace of foreclosures as subprime mortgage rates reset was also seen as posing a downside risk to the housing market.  Nonetheless, participants observed that conforming mortgages remained readily available to creditworthy borrowers and that rates on these mortgages had declined in recent weeks.  Moreover, conditions in the jumbo mortgage market were expected to improve gradually over time.Although employment probably was not as weak as the most recent monthly data had suggested, trend growth in jobs had fallen off even prior to the recent financial market strains, and participants judged that some further slowing of employment growth was likely.  Indeed, financial services firms had already announced layoffs, largely reflecting mortgage market developments, the demand for temporary workers appeared to have softened, and the most recent weakening in construction employment was likely to continue for a while.  Moreover, if declines in house prices were to damp consumption, that could feed back on employment and income, exerting additional restraint on the demand for housing.  Nonetheless, to date, initial claims for unemployment insurance did not indicate a substantial and widespread weakening in labor demand, and labor markets across the country generally remained fairly tight, with several participants citing continued reports of shortages of labor from their contacts in some sectors.Participants thought that the most likely prospect was for consumer expenditures to continue to expand at a moderate pace on average over coming quarters, supported by growth in employment and income.  However, some participants saw indications of a possible weakening of consumer spending.  Sales of automobiles and building materials had flagged of late, and survey measures suggested that consumer confidence had been adversely affected by the recent financial market developments.  Also, a further tightening of terms for home equity lines of credit and second mortgages seemed possible, which could weigh on consumer spending, especially for consumer durables.Participants reported that recent financial market developments generally appeared to have had limited effects to date on business capital spending plans and expected that business investment was likely to remain healthy in coming quarters. The access of investment-grade corporate borrowers to credit so far remained unimpeded, and rates on investment-grade bonds had declined in recent weeks.  Moreover, participants noted that many capital expenditures were internally financed, making them less sensitive to credit market conditions.  Nonetheless, the pace of financing for lower-rated firms--including issuance of both speculative-grade bonds and leveraged loans--had slowed sharply over the summer.  Participants also noted that standards and terms for commercial real estate credit reportedly had tightened, and that credit availability for homebuilders could be trimmed going forward.  In addition, contacts indicated that business executives in parts of the country had apparently become somewhat more cautious and that some were delaying investment outlays in view of heightened economic and financial uncertainty.Some participants noted that foreign demand remained robust and net exports appeared strong.  Port utilization rates reportedly remained high.  Participants discussed the turbulence in foreign financial markets and noted that unusually high precautionary demand for dollar-denominated term funding in Europe had added to strains in U.S. interbank markets and contributed to a wide spread between libor and federal funds rates.Participants made only modest revisions to their outlook for inflation in the period since the Committee\\'s last regular meeting.  Still, they recognized that incoming data on core inflation continued to be favorable, and they generally were a little more confident that the decline in inflation earlier this year would be sustained.  Inflation expectations seemed to be contained, and the less robust economic outlook implied somewhat less pressure on resources going forward.  Participants nonetheless remained concerned about possible upside risks to inflation.  Higher benefit costs, rising unit labor costs more generally, reduced markups, and levels of resource utilization both in the United States and abroad that remained relatively high were all cited as factors that could contribute to inflationary pressures.  Inflation risks could be heightened if the dollar were to continue to depreciate significantly.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored an easing of the stance of monetary policy.  Members emphasized that because of the recent sharp change in credit market conditions, the incoming data in many cases were of limited value in assessing the likely evolution of economic activity and prices, on which the Committee\\'s policy decision must be based.  Members judged that a lowering of the target funds rate was appropriate to help offset the effects of tighter financial conditions on the economic outlook.  Without such policy action, members saw a risk that tightening credit conditions and an intensifying housing correction would lead to significant broader weakness in output and employment.  Similarly, the impaired functioning of financial markets might persist for some time or possibly worsen, with negative implications for economic activity.  In order to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the economy that might otherwise arise, all members agreed that a rate cut of 50 basis points at this meeting was the most prudent course of action.  Such a measure should not interfere with an adjustment to more realistic pricing of risk or with the gains and losses that implied for participants in financial markets.  With economic growth likely to run below its potential for a while and with incoming inflation data to the favorable side, the easing of policy seemed unlikely to affect adversely the outlook for inflation.The Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should indicate that the outlook for economic growth had shifted appreciably since the Committee\\'s last regular meeting but that the 50 basis point easing in policy should help to promote moderate growth over time.  They also agreed that the inflation situation seemed to have improved slightly and judged that it was no longer appropriate to indicate that a sustained moderation in inflation pressures had yet to be shown.  Nonetheless, all agreed that some inflation risks remained and that the statement should indicate that the Committee would continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.  Given the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook, the Committee decided to refrain from providing an explicit assessment of the balance of risks, as such a characterization could give the mistaken impression that the Committee was more certain about the economic outlook than was in fact the case.  Future actions would depend on how economic prospects were affected by evolving market developments and by other factors.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4-3/4  percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p.m.:\"Developments in financial markets since the Committee\\'s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.\"Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke, Geithner, Evans, Hoenig, Kohn, Kroszner, Mishkin, Poole, Rosengren, and Warsh.Votes against this action: None.The Committee then resumed its discussion of monetary policy communication issues.  Subsequently, in a joint session of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents discussed additional policy options to address strains in money markets.  No decisions were made in this session, but it was agreed that policymakers should continue to consider such options carefully.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, October 30-31, 2007.The meeting adjourned at 3:55 p.m.Notation VoteBy notation vote completed on August 27, 2007, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on August 7, 2007.Conference CallsOn August 10, 2007, the Committee reviewed developments in money and credit markets, where strains had worsened in the days since its last meeting.  Participants discussed the condition of domestic and foreign financial markets, the Open Market Desk\\'s approach to open market operations, possible adjustments to the discount rate, and the statement to be issued immediately after the conference call.On August 16, 2007, the Committee again met by conference call.  With financial market conditions having deteriorated further, meeting participants discussed the potential usefulness of various policy responses.  The discussion focused primarily on changes associated with the discount window that would be directed at improving the functioning of the money markets.  Most participants expressed strong support for taking such steps, although some concern was noted about the likely effectiveness of these measures and one participant also questioned their appropriateness.  In light of the risks posed to the economic outlook by the tighter credit conditions and the increased uncertainty in financial markets, the Committee felt that the downside risks to growth had increased appreciably, but that a change in the federal funds rate target was not yet warranted.  However, the situation bore close watching.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to approve the text below to be released the following morning:\"Financial market conditions have deteriorated, and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward. In these circumstances, although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace, the Federal Open Market Committee judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably. The Committee is monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.\"Votes for:  Messrs.

Return to textIn the agenda for this meeting, it was reported that advices of the election of Charles L. Evans as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee had been received and that he had executed his oath of office.By unanimous vote, the Federal Open Market Committee selected James A. Clouse and Daniel G. Sullivan to serve as Associate Economists until the selection of their successors at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee in 2008.The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market operations in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.The information reviewed at the September meeting suggested that economic activity advanced at a moderate rate early in the third quarter.  After expanding at a robust pace in July, retail sales rose at a somewhat slower rate in August.  Orders and shipments of capital goods posted solid gains in July.  However, residential investment weakened further, even before the recent disruptions in mortgage markets.  In addition, private payrolls posted only a small gain in August, and manufacturing production decreased after gains in the previous two months.  Meanwhile, core inflation rose a bit from the low rates observed in the spring but remained moderate through July.Private nonfarm payroll employment rose only modestly in August, and the levels of employment in June and July were revised down.  The weakness in employment was spread fairly widely across industries.  Residential construction and manufacturing posted noticeable declines in jobs, employment in wholesale trade and transportation was little changed, and hiring at business services was well below recent trends.  Both the average workweek and aggregate hours were unchanged in August.  The unemployment rate held steady at 4.6 percent, 0.1 percentage point above its second-quarter level and equal to its 2006 average.After posting solid gains in June and July, total industrial production edged up only a bit in August.  This increase was attributable to a surge in electricity generation, as temperatures swung from mild in July to very warm in August.  After large gains in the preceding two months, manufacturing output declined in August, held down by a decrease in the production of motor vehicles and parts.  High-tech output rose only modestly in August, but production gains in June and July were revised up considerably.Consumer spending appeared to have strengthened early in the summer from its subdued second-quarter pace.  Although auto sales were weak in July, real outlays for other goods rose briskly.  At the same time, spending on services was up moderately despite a drop in outlays for energy associated with relatively cool weather in the eastern part of the United States.  In August, consumption appeared to have posted another solid gain.  Although nominal retail sales outside the motor vehicle sector were about flat (abstracting from a drop in nominal sales at gasoline stations associated with falling gas prices), vehicle sales stepped up and warmer weather likely caused an increase in energy usage.  Real disposable income rose further in July, as wages and salaries posted a strong gain and energy prices came down.  However, household wealth likely was providing a diminishing impetus to the pace of spending, reflecting recent declines in stock market wealth and an apparent further deceleration in house prices.  Readings on consumer sentiment turned down in August after having risen in July, and the Reuters/Michigan index remained near its relatively low August level in early September.The housing sector remained exceptionally weak.  Home sales had dropped considerably this year: Sales of new and existing single-family homes in July were down substantially from their averages over the second half of last year.  Demand was restrained by deteriorating conditions in the subprime mortgage market and by an increase in rates for thirty-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages.  In the nonconforming mortgage market, the availability of financing to borrowers recently appeared to have been crimped even further.  Most forward-looking indicators of housing demand, including an index of pending home sales, pointed to a further deterioration in sales in the near term.  Single-family starts slid in July to their lowest reading since 1996, and adjusted permit issuance continued on a downward trajectory.  Although single-family housing starts had come down substantially from their peak, the drop had lagged the decline in demand, and as a result, inventories of new homes had risen considerably.  In the multifamily sector, starts in July were in line with readings thus far this year and at the low end of the fairly narrow range seen since 1997.  Meanwhile, house prices generally continued to decelerate.Orders and shipments of capital goods posted a strong gain early in the third quarter.  In particular, orders and shipments of equipment outside the high-tech and transportation sector registered a robust increase in July, and data on computer production and shipments of high-tech goods pointed to solid increases in business demand for high-tech.  In contrast, indicators of spending for transportation equipment were mixed.  Aircraft shipments in July and public information on Boeing\\'s deliveries suggested that domestic spending on aircraft was retreating somewhat in the current quarter.  While fleet sales of light vehicles appeared to have moved up in July and August, sales of medium and heavy trucks remained below the second-quarter average.  More generally, surveys of business conditions suggested that increases in business activity were somewhat slower in August than in the second quarter.Book-value data for the manufacturing and trade sectors excluding motor vehicles and parts suggested that inventory accumulation stepped down noticeably in July from the second-quarter pace.  Inventories of light motor vehicles rose again in July and August.  The number of manufacturing purchasing managers who viewed their customers\\' inventory levels as too low in August slightly exceeded the number who saw them as too high.The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in July, as exports increased more than imports.  Sharp increases in exports of both aircraft and automobiles contributed importantly to the overall gain.  Exports of agricultural products and consumer goods were also strong.  In contrast, exports of industrial supplies and semiconductors exhibited declines.  The value of imported goods and services was boosted by a large increase in imports of automotive products.  Higher imports of capital goods excluding aircraft, computers, and semiconductors and of oil also contributed to the overall gain in imports.Economic growth slowed in the second quarter in most advanced foreign economies, except the United Kingdom.  The step-down was most pronounced in Japan, where GDP contracted, but was also substantial in the euro area, where total domestic demand rose only slightly.  Although growth remained robust in Canada, data late in the quarter, including retail sales, indicated a more significant weakening in activity.  This softness appeared to have continued into the third quarter in some economies.  In July, indicators for Europe generally moderated, on balance, from their second-quarter levels; those for Canada and Japan, however, slowed more notably.  Most of the readings available on economic developments after August 9, when financial turmoil intensified, were measures of confidence.  They dropped, on average, but otherwise were consistent with the indicators reported for July.Data through July suggested that economic activity in emerging-market countries remained robust.  Output in the Asian economies soared in the second quarter, and several countries posted growth at or near double-digit rates.  In Latin America, output in Mexico and Venezuela rebounded sharply from earlier weakness.  Indicators for China in July pointed to only a modest slowing of output growth from its torrid pace in the first half of the year.  The scant data for August received thus far provided little indication that the turmoil in financial markets had a significant negative impact on real economic activity in emerging-market economies.After rapid price increases earlier this year, U.S. headline consumer price inflation was moderate in both June and July.  Although food prices continued their string of sizable increases, energy prices fell in June and July and gasoline prices appear to have dropped further in August.  Core PCE prices rose 0.2 percent in June and 0.1 percent in July.  On a twelve-month-change basis, core PCE inflation in July was below the comparable rate twelve months earlier.  Step-downs in price inflation for prescription drugs, motor vehicles, and nonmarket services accounted for nearly all of the deceleration in core PCE prices.  Although owners\\' equivalent rent decelerated over the past year, this change was largely offset by an acceleration in tenants\\' rent and lodging away from home.  Household surveys indicated that the median expectation for year-ahead inflation declined in August and edged down further in early September to a level only slightly above the reading at the turn of the year; the median expectation of longer-term inflation in early September remained in the range seen over the past couple of years.  The producer price index for core intermediate materials rose only modestly in July.  Compensation per hour decelerated in the second quarter.  Nonetheless, the increase over the four quarters ending in the second quarter was noticeably above the increase in the preceding four quarters and well above the rise in the employment cost index over the same period.At its August meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  In the statement, the Committee acknowledged that financial markets had been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions had become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction was ongoing.  The Committee reiterated its view that the economy seemed likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.  Readings on core inflation had improved modestly in recent months.  However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures had yet to be convincingly demonstrated.  Moreover, the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain these pressures.  Although the downside risks to growth had increased somewhat, the Committee repeated that its predominant policy concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected.  Future policy adjustments would depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.  The FOMC\\'s policy decision and the accompanying statement were about in line with market expectations, and reactions in financial markets were muted.In the days after the August FOMC meeting, financial market participants appeared to become more concerned about liquidity and counterparty credit risk.  Unsecured bank funding markets showed signs of stress, including volatility in overnight lending rates, elevated term rates, and illiquidity in term funding markets.  On August 10, the Federal Reserve issued a statement announcing that it was providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly functioning of financial markets.  The Federal Reserve indicated that it would provide reserves as necessary through open market operations to promote trading in the federal funds market at rates close to the target rate of 5-1/4 percent.  The Federal Reserve also noted that the discount window was available as a source of funding.On August 17, the FOMC issued a statement noting that financial market conditions had deteriorated and that tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty had the potential to restrain economic growth going forward.  The FOMC judged that the downside risks to growth had increased appreciably, indicated that it was monitoring the situation, and stated that it was prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.  Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve Board announced that, to promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets, it had approved a 50 basis point reduction in the primary credit rate to 5-3/4 percent.  The Board also announced a change to the Reserve Banks\\' usual practices to allow the provision of term financing for as long as thirty days, renewable by the borrower.  In addition, the Board noted that the Federal Reserve would continue to accept a broad range of collateral for discount window loans, including home mortgages and related assets, while maintaining existing collateral margins.  On August 21, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced some temporary changes to the terms and conditions of the SOMA securities lending program, including a reduction in the minimum fee.  The effective federal funds rate was somewhat below the target rate for a time over the intermeeting period, as efforts to keep the funds rate near the target were hampered by technical factors and financial market volatility.  In the days leading up to the FOMC meeting, however, the funds rate traded closer to the target.Short-term financial markets came under pressure over the intermeeting period amid heightened investor unease about exposures to subprime mortgages and to structured credit products more generally.  Rates on asset-backed commercial paper and on low-rated unsecured commercial paper soared, and some issuers, particularly asset-backed commercial paper programs with investments in subprime mortgages, found it difficult to roll over maturing paper.  These developments led several programs to draw on backup lines, exercise options to extend the maturity of outstanding paper, or even default.  As a result, asset-backed commercial paper outstanding contracted substantially.  Investors sought the safety and liquidity of Treasury securities, and yields on Treasury bills dropped sharply for a period; trading conditions in the bill market were impaired at times.  Meanwhile, banks took measures to conserve their liquidity and were cautious about counterparties\\' exposures to asset-backed commercial paper.  Term interbank funding markets were significantly impaired, with rates rising well above expected future overnight rates and traders reporting a substantial drop in the availability of term funding.  Pressures eased a bit in mid-September, but short-term financial markets remained strained.Conditions in corporate credit markets were mixed.  Investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond spreads edged up; they were near their highest levels in four years, although they remained far below the peaks seen in mid-2002.  Investment-grade bond issuance was strong in August as yields declined, but issuance of speculative-grade bonds was scant.  Speculative-grade bond deals and leveraged loans slated to finance leveraged buyouts continued to be delayed or restructured.  Bank lending to businesses surged in August, apparently because some banks funded leveraged loans that they had intended to syndicate to institutional investors and perhaps because some firms substituted bank credit for commercial paper.  Although markets for nonconforming mortgages were impaired over the intermeeting period, the supply of conforming mortgages seemed to have been largely unaffected by recent developments.  Broad stock price indexes were volatile but about unchanged, on net, over the intermeeting period.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies fell, on balance.Investors appeared to mark down significantly their expected path for the federal funds rate during the intermeeting period, evidently in response to the strains in money and credit markets and a few key data releases, including weaker-than-expected reports on housing activity and employment.  Yields on nominal Treasury securities fell appreciably across the term structure.  TIPS-based inflation compensation at the five-year horizon was about unchanged, while inflation compensation at longer horizons crept higher.Growth of nonfinancial domestic debt was estimated to have slowed a little in the third quarter from the average pace in the first half of the year.  The deceleration in total nonfinancial debt reflected a projected slowdown in borrowing across all major sectors of the economy excluding the federal government.  Although it decelerated in the third quarter, business-sector debt continued to advance at a solid pace, boosted by a surge in business loans.  In the household sector, mortgage borrowing was estimated to have slowed notably, as mortgage interest rates moved up, nonconforming mortgages became harder to obtain, and as home sales slowed and house prices decelerated.  M2 increased at a brisk pace in August.  The rise was led by a surge in liquid deposits and in retail money funds as investors adjusted their portfolios in response to the turmoil in financial markets.In preparation for this meeting, the staff continued to estimate that real GDP increased at a moderate rate in the third quarter.  However, the staff marked down the fourth-quarter forecast, reflecting a judgment that the recent financial turbulence would impose restraint on economic activity in coming months, particularly in the housing sector.  The staff also trimmed its forecast of real GDP growth in 2008 and anticipated a modest increase in unemployment.  Softer demand for homes amid a reduction in the availability of mortgage credit would likely curtail construction activity through the middle of next year.  Moreover, lower housing wealth, slower gains in employment and income, and reduced confidence seemed likely to restrain consumer spending in 2008.  Despite the recent difficulties in some corporate credit markets, financial conditions confronting most nonfinancial businesses did not appear to have tightened appreciably to date.  But going forward, the staff anticipated that businesses would scale back their capital spending a touch in response to financing conditions that were likely to become a little less accommodative and to more modest gains in sales.  With credit markets expected to largely recover over coming quarters, growth of real GDP was projected to firm in 2009 to a pace a bit above the rate of growth of its potential.  Incoming data on consumer price inflation that were slightly to the low side of the previous forecast, in combination with the easing of pressures on resource utilization in the current forecast, led the staff to trim slightly its forecast for core PCE inflation.  Headline PCE inflation, which was boosted by sizable increases in energy and food prices earlier in the year, was expected to slow in 2008 and 2009.In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants focused on the potential for recent credit market developments to restrain aggregate demand in coming quarters.  The disruptions to the market for nonconforming mortgages were likely to reduce further the demand for housing, and recent financial developments could well lead to a more general tightening of credit availability.  Moreover, some recent data and anecdotal information pointed to a possible nascent slowdown in the pace of expansion.  Given the unusual nature of the current financial shock, participants regarded the outlook for economic activity as characterized by particularly high uncertainty, with the risks to growth skewed to the downside.  Some participants cited concerns that a weaker economy could lead to a further tightening of financial conditions, which in turn could reinforce the economic slowdown.  But participants also noted that the resilience of the economy in the face of a number of previous periods of financial market disruptions left open the possibility that the macroeconomic effects of the financial market turbulence would prove limited.Although financial markets were expected to stabilize over time, participants judged that credit markets were likely to restrain economic growth in the period ahead.  Given existing commitments to customers and the increased resistance of investors to purchasing some securitized products, banks might need to take a large volume of assets onto their balance sheets over coming weeks, including leveraged loans, asset-backed commercial paper, and some types of mortgages.  Banks\\' concerns about the implications of rapid growth in their balance sheets for their capital ratios and for their liquidity, as well as the recent deterioration in various term funding markets, might well lead banks to tighten the availability of credit to households and firms.  Tighter credit conditions were likely to weigh particularly on residential investment and to a lesser extent on other components of aggregate demand in coming quarters.  Meeting participants also noted that financial market conditions, while seeming to have improved somewhat in the most recent days, were still fragile and that further adverse credit market developments could well increase the downside risks to the economy.  Even after market volatility subsided and the recent strains eased, risk spreads probably would be wider and credit terms tighter than they had been a few months ago.  Although these developments would likely be consistent with longer-term financial stability, they were likely to exert some restraint on aggregate demand.In their discussion of individual sectors of the economy, participants noted that recent data suggested greater weakness in the housing market than had previously been expected.  Furthermore, recent financial developments had the potential to deepen further and prolong the downturn in the housing market, as subprime mortgages remained essentially unavailable, little activity was evident in the markets for other nonprime mortgages, and prime jumbo mortgage borrowers faced higher rates and tighter lending standards.  The faster pace of foreclosures as subprime mortgage rates reset was also seen as posing a downside risk to the housing market.  Nonetheless, participants observed that conforming mortgages remained readily available to creditworthy borrowers and that rates on these mortgages had declined in recent weeks.  Moreover, conditions in the jumbo mortgage market were expected to improve gradually over time.Although employment probably was not as weak as the most recent monthly data had suggested, trend growth in jobs had fallen off even prior to the recent financial market strains, and participants judged that some further slowing of employment growth was likely.  Indeed, financial services firms had already announced layoffs, largely reflecting mortgage market developments, the demand for temporary workers appeared to have softened, and the most recent weakening in construction employment was likely to continue for a while.  Moreover, if declines in house prices were to damp consumption, that could feed back on employment and income, exerting additional restraint on the demand for housing.  Nonetheless, to date, initial claims for unemployment insurance did not indicate a substantial and widespread weakening in labor demand, and labor markets across the country generally remained fairly tight, with several participants citing continued reports of shortages of labor from their contacts in some sectors.Participants thought that the most likely prospect was for consumer expenditures to continue to expand at a moderate pace on average over coming quarters, supported by growth in employment and income.  However, some participants saw indications of a possible weakening of consumer spending.  Sales of automobiles and building materials had flagged of late, and survey measures suggested that consumer confidence had been adversely affected by the recent financial market developments.  Also, a further tightening of terms for home equity lines of credit and second mortgages seemed possible, which could weigh on consumer spending, especially for consumer durables.Participants reported that recent financial market developments generally appeared to have had limited effects to date on business capital spending plans and expected that business investment was likely to remain healthy in coming quarters. The access of investment-grade corporate borrowers to credit so far remained unimpeded, and rates on investment-grade bonds had declined in recent weeks.  Moreover, participants noted that many capital expenditures were internally financed, making them less sensitive to credit market conditions.  Nonetheless, the pace of financing for lower-rated firms--including issuance of both speculative-grade bonds and leveraged loans--had slowed sharply over the summer.  Participants also noted that standards and terms for commercial real estate credit reportedly had tightened, and that credit availability for homebuilders could be trimmed going forward.  In addition, contacts indicated that business executives in parts of the country had apparently become somewhat more cautious and that some were delaying investment outlays in view of heightened economic and financial uncertainty.Some participants noted that foreign demand remained robust and net exports appeared strong.  Port utilization rates reportedly remained high.  Participants discussed the turbulence in foreign financial markets and noted that unusually high precautionary demand for dollar-denominated term funding in Europe had added to strains in U.S. interbank markets and contributed to a wide spread between libor and federal funds rates.Participants made only modest revisions to their outlook for inflation in the period since the Committee\\'s last regular meeting.  Still, they recognized that incoming data on core inflation continued to be favorable, and they generally were a little more confident that the decline in inflation earlier this year would be sustained.  Inflation expectations seemed to be contained, and the less robust economic outlook implied somewhat less pressure on resources going forward.  Participants nonetheless remained concerned about possible upside risks to inflation.  Higher benefit costs, rising unit labor costs more generally, reduced markups, and levels of resource utilization both in the United States and abroad that remained relatively high were all cited as factors that could contribute to inflationary pressures.  Inflation risks could be heightened if the dollar were to continue to depreciate significantly.In the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored an easing of the stance of monetary policy.  Members emphasized that because of the recent sharp change in credit market conditions, the incoming data in many cases were of limited value in assessing the likely evolution of economic activity and prices, on which the Committee\\'s policy decision must be based.  Members judged that a lowering of the target funds rate was appropriate to help offset the effects of tighter financial conditions on the economic outlook.  Without such policy action, members saw a risk that tightening credit conditions and an intensifying housing correction would lead to significant broader weakness in output and employment.  Similarly, the impaired functioning of financial markets might persist for some time or possibly worsen, with negative implications for economic activity.  In order to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the economy that might otherwise arise, all members agreed that a rate cut of 50 basis points at this meeting was the most prudent course of action.  Such a measure should not interfere with an adjustment to more realistic pricing of risk or with the gains and losses that implied for participants in financial markets.  With economic growth likely to run below its potential for a while and with incoming inflation data to the favorable side, the easing of policy seemed unlikely to affect adversely the outlook for inflation.The Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should indicate that the outlook for economic growth had shifted appreciably since the Committee\\'s last regular meeting but that the 50 basis point easing in policy should help to promote moderate growth over time.  They also agreed that the inflation situation seemed to have improved slightly and judged that it was no longer appropriate to indicate that a sustained moderation in inflation pressures had yet to be shown.  Nonetheless, all agreed that some inflation risks remained and that the statement should indicate that the Committee would continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.  Given the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook, the Committee decided to refrain from providing an explicit assessment of the balance of risks, as such a characterization could give the mistaken impression that the Committee was more certain about the economic outlook than was in fact the case.  Future actions would depend on how economic prospects were affected by evolving market developments and by other factors.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4-3/4  percent.\"The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p.m.:\"Developments in financial markets since the Committee\\'s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.\"Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke, Geithner, Evans, Hoenig, Kohn, Kroszner, Mishkin, Poole, Rosengren, and Warsh.Votes against this action: None.The Committee then resumed its discussion of monetary policy communication issues.  Subsequently, in a joint session of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents discussed additional policy options to address strains in money markets.  No decisions were made in this session, but it was agreed that policymakers should continue to consider such options carefully.It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, October 30-31, 2007.The meeting adjourned at 3:55 p.m.Notation VoteBy notation vote completed on August 27, 2007, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on August 7, 2007.Conference CallsOn August 10, 2007, the Committee reviewed developments in money and credit markets, where strains had worsened in the days since its last meeting.  Participants discussed the condition of domestic and foreign financial markets, the Open Market Desk\\'s approach to open market operations, possible adjustments to the discount rate, and the statement to be issued immediately after the conference call.On August 16, 2007, the Committee again met by conference call.  With financial market conditions having deteriorated further, meeting participants discussed the potential usefulness of various policy responses.  The discussion focused primarily on changes associated with the discount window that would be directed at improving the functioning of the money markets.  Most participants expressed strong support for taking such steps, although some concern was noted about the likely effectiveness of these measures and one participant also questioned their appropriateness.  In light of the risks posed to the economic outlook by the tighter credit conditions and the increased uncertainty in financial markets, the Committee felt that the downside risks to growth had increased appreciably, but that a change in the federal funds rate target was not yet warranted.  However, the situation bore close watching.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to approve the text below to be released the following morning:\"Financial market conditions have deteriorated, and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward. In these circumstances, although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace, the Federal Open Market Committee judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably. The Committee is monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.\"Votes for:  Messrs.

The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the \\r\\n    Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out \\r\\n    the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the \\r\\n    Committee:\\n\\n(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including \\r\\n      securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are \\r\\n      direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and \\r\\n      interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from \\r\\n      or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts \\r\\n      maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, \\r\\n      regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market \\r\\n      Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing \\r\\n      U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the \\r\\n      individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; \\r\\n      provided that the aggregate amount of U.S. Government and Federal \\r\\n      agency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments) \\r\\n      at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at \\r\\n      which action is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive \\r\\n      shall not be increased or decreased by more than $8.0 billion during \\r\\n      the period commencing with the opening of business on the day \\r\\n      following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the \\r\\n      day of the next such meeting:\\n(b) When appropriate, to buy or sell in the open market, from or \\r\\n      to acceptance dealers and foreign accounts maintained at the Federal \\r\\n      Reserve Bank of New York. on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery \\r\\n      basis, for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at \\r\\n      market discount rates, prime bankers acceptances with maturities of up \\r\\n      to nine months at the time of acceptance that (1) arise out of the \\r\\n      current shipment of goods between countries or within the United \\r\\n      States, or (2) arise out of the storage within the United States of \\r\\n      goods under contract of sale or expected to move into the channels of \\r\\n      trade within a reasonable time and that are secured throughout their \\r\\n      life by a warehouse receipt or similar document conveying title to the \\r\\n      underlying goods: provided that the aggregate amount of bankers \\r\\n      acceptances held at any one time shall not exceed $100 million:\\n(c) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are \\r\\n      direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and \\r\\n      interest by, any agency of the United States, and prime bankers \\r\\n      acceptances of the types authorized for purchase under l(b) above, \\r\\n      from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \\r\\n      under agreements for repurchase of such securities, obligations, or \\r\\n      acceptances in 15 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless \\r\\n      otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined \\r\\n      by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the \\r\\n      volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the \\r\\n      event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such \\r\\n      agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement \\r\\n      or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred \\r\\n      to the System Open Market Account; and provided further that in the \\r\\n      event bankers acceptances covered by any such agreement are not \\r\\n      repurchased by the seller, they shall continue to be held by the \\r\\n      Federal Reserve Bank or shall be sold in the open market.\\n\\n2.

In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market \\r\\n    operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments \\r\\n    for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal \\r\\n    Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes \\r\\n    and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open \\r\\n    Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such foreign and \\r\\n    international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under \\r\\n    agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those \\r\\n    securities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those \\r\\n    available on such transactions in the market: and (b) for New York \\r\\n    Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to \\r\\n    the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in \\r\\n    paragraph l(c), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency \\r\\n    securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase \\r\\n    agreements between its own account and foreign and international \\r\\n    accounts maintained at the Bank.

The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the \\r\\n    Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to \\r\\n    the extent necessary to carry out the Committee\\'s foreign currency \\r\\n    directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant \\r\\n    thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the \\r\\n    Committee may issue from time to time:\\n\\nA. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the \\r\\n      form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the \\r\\n      open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. \\r\\n      Treasury, with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by \\r\\n      Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary \\r\\n      authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with \\r\\n      other international financial institutions:\\nAustrian schillings \\r\\n      Belgian francs \\r\\n      Canadian dollars \\r\\n      Danish kroner \\r\\n      Pounds sterling \\r\\n      French francs \\r\\n      German marks \\r\\n      Italian lire \\r\\n      Japanese yen \\r\\n      Mexican pesos \\r\\n      Netherlands guilders \\r\\n      Norwegian kroner \\r\\n      Swedish kronor \\r\\n      Swiss francs\\nB. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts \\r\\n      to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A \\r\\n      above.\\nC. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw \\r\\n      dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph \\r\\n      2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such \\r\\n      arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any \\r\\n      amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee, \\r\\n      because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.\\nD. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies \\r\\n      not exceeding $25.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open \\r\\n      position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding \\r\\n      signs) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in \\r\\n      a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that \\r\\n      currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus \\r\\n      outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as \\r\\n      the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.\\n\\n2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve \\r\\n    Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (\"swap\" \\r\\n    arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a \\r\\n    maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among \\r\\n    those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \\r\\n    System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign \\r\\n    Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew \\r\\n  such arrangements on maturity:\\n\\n\\nForeign bank\\nAmount of arrangement\\r\\n        (millions of dollars equivalent)\\n\\n\\nAustrian National Bank\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0250\\n\\n\\nNational Bank of Belgium\\n1,000\\n\\n\\nBank of Canada\\n2,000 \\n\\n\\nNational Bank of Denmark\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0250\\n\\n\\nBank of England\\n3,000\\n\\n\\nBank of France\\n2,000\\n\\n\\nGerman Federal Bank\\n6,000\\n\\n\\nBank of Italy\\n3,000\\n\\n\\nBank of Japan\\n5,000\\n\\n\\nBank of Mexico\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0700\\n\\n\\nNetherlands Bank\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0500\\n\\n\\nBank of Norway\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0250\\n\\n\\nBank of Sweden\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0300\\n\\n\\nSwiss National Bank\\n4,000\\n\\n\\nBank for International Settlements:\\n\\n\\nDollars against Swiss francs\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0600\\n\\n\\nDollars against authorized European currencies other than Swiss francs \\n1,250\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAny changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the \\r\\n    proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall \\r\\n    be referred for review and approval to the Committee.\\n3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph \\r\\n    l.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the \\r\\n    Committee, be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of \\r\\n    providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign \\r\\n    currencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or \\r\\n    received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign \\r\\n    central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.\\n4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central \\r\\n    banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In \\r\\n    making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System \\r\\n    holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \\r\\n    shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless \\r\\n    authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or \\r\\n    understandings concerning the administration of the accounts \\r\\n    maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign \\r\\n    banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of \\r\\n    Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the \\r\\n    Committee.\\n5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested insofar as \\r\\n    practicable, considering needs for minimum working balances.

The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the \\r\\n    Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the \\r\\n    Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman \\r\\n    may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on \\r\\n    the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as \\r\\n    alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, \\r\\n    his alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the \\r\\n    request of any member, or at the request of the Manager for Foreign \\r\\n    Operations, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), for the purposes \\r\\n    of reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with \\r\\n    the Manager on other matters relating to his responsibilities. At the \\r\\n    request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such \\r\\n    reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the \\r\\n  Federal Open Market Committee.\\n7. The Chairman is authorized:\\n\\nA. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed \\r\\n      agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about \\r\\n      the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between \\r\\n      the System and the Treasury;\\nB.

System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be \\r\\n    directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that \\r\\n    market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior \\r\\n    consistent with the IMF Article IV, Section 1.\\n2. To achieve this end the System shall:\\n\\nA. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign \\r\\n      exchange.\\nB.

In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the \\r\\n      United States Treasury;\\nB. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary \\r\\n      authorities; and\\nC. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United \\r\\n      States in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange \\r\\n      arrangements under the IMF Article IV.\\n\\nBy unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions With Respect \\r\\n    to Foreign Currency Operations shown below were amended to reflect the \\r\\n    new title of Manager for Foreign Operations, System Open Market \\r\\n    Account.\\nPROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO \\r\\n    FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS \\r\\n    Amended February 3, 1994\\nIn conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and \\r\\n    direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the \\r\\n    Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency \\r\\n    Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager \\r\\n    for Foreign Operations, System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), shall \\r\\n    be guided by the following procedural understandings with respect to \\r\\n    consultations and clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency \\r\\n    Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee. All operations \\r\\n    undertaken pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to \\r\\n  the Committee.\\n1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the \\r\\n    Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the \\r\\n    Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\\n\\nA. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s \\r\\n      overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on \\r\\n      any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the \\r\\n      Committee.\\nB. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the \\r\\n      System\\'s net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 \\r\\n      million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with \\r\\n      repayment of swap drawings.\\nC. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of \\r\\n      trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change \\r\\n      in the System\\'s net position in that currency might be less than the \\r\\n      limits specified in l.B.\\nD. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the \\r\\n      larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap \\r\\n      arrangement.\\n\\n2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the \\r\\n    Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the \\r\\n    full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the \\r\\n    Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the \\r\\n    Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):\\n\\nA. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s \\r\\n      overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion \\r\\n      since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.\\nB. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the \\r\\n      larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap \\r\\n      arrangement.\\n\\n3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the \\r\\n    Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any \\r\\n    operations that are not of a routine character.\\nAgreement to \"Warehouse\" Foreign Currencies\\nAt its meeting on February 2-3, 1993, the Committee had \\r\\n    reaffirmed the $5 billion limit on the amount of eligible foreign \\r\\n    currencies that the System was prepared to \"warehouse\" for the \\r\\n    Treasury and the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The purpose of \\r\\n    the warehousing facility is to supplement, at the discretion of the \\r\\n    Federal Reserve, the U.S. dollar resources of the Treasury and the ESF \\r\\n    for financing their purchases of foreign currencies and related \\r\\n    international operations. There had been no use of this facility \\r\\n    since a ESF repayment of $2 billion on April 2, 1992. The Committee \\r\\n    decided at this meeting to reaffirm the $5 billion ceiling which it \\r\\n    viewed as providing adequate operational flexibility to respond on \\r\\n  short notice to unanticipated developments.\\n\\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan \\r\\n      McDonough, Broaddus, Forrestal, Kelley, LaWare, \\r\\n      Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.\\nVote against this action: Mr. Jordan.\\nAbsent and not voting: Messrs. Angell and \\r\\n      Mullins.\\n\\nMr. Jordan dissented because he felt that providing funds to \\r\\n    the Treasury using a warehousing arrangement was, in effect, a loan to \\r\\n    the Treasury. In his opinion, direct financing of government \\r\\n    operations by the central bank is inappropriate and could compromise \\r\\n    the effective conduct of monetary policy. He did not rule out the \\r\\n    possible efficacy of some warehousing transactions in very exceptional \\r\\n    circumstances in the future, but he believed that the latter should be \\r\\n    approved only after full Committee discussion. Accordingly, he did \\r\\n    not want to retain the standing $5 billion authorization.\\nBy unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the \\r\\n    meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on December 21, \\r\\n    1993, were approved.\\nThe Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments \\r\\n    in foreign exchange markets during the period since the December \\r\\n    meeting. There were no System open market transactions in foreign \\r\\n    currencies during this period, and thus no vote was required of the \\r\\n    Committee.\\nThe Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments \\r\\n    in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions \\r\\n    in government securities and federal agency obligations during the \\r\\n    period December 21, 1993, through February 3, 1994. By unanimous \\r\\n    vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\\nThe Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and \\r\\n    financial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in \\r\\n    1994, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting \\r\\n    period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information \\r\\n    available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee\\'s discussion \\r\\n    is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was \\r\\n    approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of \\r\\n    New York.\\nThe information reviewed at this meeting indicated that \\r\\n    economic activity recorded a strong advance during the closing months \\r\\n    of 1993, and the limited data available on production and employment \\r\\n    suggested appreciable further gains in the early weeks of this year. \\r\\n    Housing starts had strengthened substantially in the fourth quarter of \\r\\n    last year, and business fixed investment had registered a sharp rise. \\r\\n    Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices, excluding \\r\\n    their food and energy components, had been somewhat larger in recent \\r\\n    months than earlier in 1993, and prices of a number of commodities had \\r\\n    turned up.\\nAssessment of the January labor market data was complicated \\r\\n    by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems, but a \\r\\n    variety of indicators pointed convincingly to a further strengthening \\r\\n    in the demand for labor. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted \\r\\n    a small gain in January after a sizable December increase. \\r\\n    Manufacturing employment rose for a fourth consecutive month, with \\r\\n    gains again concentrated in motor vehicles. Construction payrolls \\r\\n    edged down, evidently reflecting the adverse effects of severe winter \\r\\n    weather. The total number of jobs in the services industries was \\r\\n    unchanged in January, but the inclement weather apparently held down \\r\\n    employment in some segments of this sector as well. The average \\r\\n    workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers rose in January to \\r\\n    its highest level in almost five years; for manufacturing, the average \\r\\n    workweek remained at its post-World War II high for a third \\r\\n    consecutive month. The civilian unemployment rate, calculated on a \\r\\n    new basis, was 6.7 percent in January.\\nIndustrial production increased appreciably further in \\r\\n    December, and the available information suggested a considerable rise \\r\\n    in January. In December, the advance in manufacturing was led by the \\r\\n    motor vehicle and computing equipment industries. Sizable increases \\r\\n    in materials and construction supplies also were recorded. On the \\r\\n    other hand, the output of consumer goods other than motor vehicles was \\r\\n    sluggish, and the production of aircraft and defense and space \\r\\n    equipment continued to shrink. Total utilization of manufacturing \\r\\n    capacity rose again in December and reached a relatively high level, \\r\\n    judged against historical experience.\\nConsumer spending, as measured by real personal consumption \\r\\n    expenditures, posted another solid increase in the fourth quarter, and \\r\\n    strong sales of motor vehicles in January suggested continued buoyancy \\r\\n    in consumer demand. In the fourth quarter, real outlays on motor \\r\\n    vehicles surged, and spending on other durable goods--notably \\r\\n    furniture, appliances and other household equipment--registered \\r\\n    further large gains. By contrast, real outlays for nondurable goods \\r\\n    and services rose only moderately. Housing starts jumped in December, \\r\\n    with both single-family and multifamily starts sharing in the advance. \\r\\n    For 1993 as a whole, housing starts were at their highest annual total \\r\\n    in four years. Sales of new homes were up sharply in November, and \\r\\n    sales of existing homes ended the year at the highest monthly level in \\r\\n    the twenty-five year history of the series.\\nReal business fixed investment recorded a very large increase \\r\\n    in the fourth quarter. Business spending for equipment, notably for \\r\\n    information processing equipment, was up sharply for a seventh \\r\\n    straight quarter. The strength evident in recent orders for \\r\\n    nondefense capital goods pointed to further gains in shipments of \\r\\n    these goods in early 1994. Outlays for nonresidential structures in \\r\\n    the fourth quarter posted their largest quarterly rise in six years; \\r\\n    the increases were spread across a broad array of categories other \\r\\n    than office buildings. Construction permits continued to rise in the \\r\\n    fourth quarter, suggesting further growth of investment in \\r\\n    nonresidential structures in the near term.\\nBusiness inventories remained generally well aligned with \\r\\n    sales through November, the most recent month for which complete data \\r\\n    were available. In manufacturing, inventory stocks fell in December \\r\\n    after edging lower in November: with brisk gains in shipments in both \\r\\n    months, the ratio of stocks to shipments fell further from levels that \\r\\n    already were low by historical standards. At the wholesale level, \\r\\n    inventories rose moderately in November after little change in the \\r\\n    preceding two months. The inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector \\r\\n    had changed little since May. Retail inventories expanded \\r\\n    substantially in November for a third straight month. The buildup of \\r\\n    stocks might have been in anticipation of robust holiday sales, but \\r\\n    for some retail businesses, particularly general merchandise stores, \\r\\n    the increases coincided with weak sales. For the retail sector as a \\r\\n    whole, the inventory-to-sales ratio was up slightly in November.\\nThe average nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit for the \\r\\n    October-November period was about the same as its average rate in the \\r\\n    third quarter. The value of exports was up for the two-month period, \\r\\n    with the increase occurring largely in machinery, automotive products, \\r\\n    and aircraft. The higher value of imports for the two-month period \\r\\n    reflected, as had been the case earlier in 1993, greater imports of \\r\\n    consumer goods, automotive products, and machinery. Trends in \\r\\n    economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared \\r\\n    to have diverged further in the fourth quarter. Moderate growth \\r\\n    appeared to be continuing in Canada and the United Kingdom, but \\r\\n    economic activity seemed to be growing more slowly or to have turned \\r\\n    down in Japan, western Germany, and France.\\nProducer prices of finished goods were down slightly in \\r\\n    December after being unchanged in November. Excluding the food and \\r\\n    energy components, producer prices edged higher in December and were \\r\\n    up slightly for the year as a whole. At the retail level, consumer \\r\\n    prices rose modestly in November and December, with energy price \\r\\n    declines holding down the increase in the overall index. For items \\r\\n    other than food and energy, prices advanced in the two months at a \\r\\n    slightly faster pace than that seen over previous months of the year; \\r\\n    for 1993 as a whole, the increase was about the same as in 1992. \\r\\n    Hourly compensation of private industry workers increased in the \\r\\n    fourth quarter at the same pace as in the third quarter. For 1993, \\r\\n    the rise in hourly compensation was little changed from the previous \\r\\n    year. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers \\r\\n    rose sharply in January, but for the twelve months ended in January, \\r\\n    the increase was the same as that recorded for the previous twelve \\r\\n    months.\\nAt its meeting on December 21, 1993, the Committee adopted a \\r\\n    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure \\r\\n    on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the \\r\\n    likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting \\r\\n    period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of \\r\\n    the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and \\r\\n    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to \\r\\n    economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or \\r\\n    slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the \\r\\n    intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this \\r\\n    directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and \\r\\n    M3 over the following months.\\nOpen market operations were directed toward maintaining the \\r\\n    existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the \\r\\n    intermeeting period. Additional reserves were supplied to the banking \\r\\n    system on a temporary basis around year-end to meet seasonal movements \\r\\n    in currency and required reserves as well as an enlarged demand for \\r\\n    excess reserves. For the intermeeting period as a whole, the federal \\r\\n    funds rate remained close to 3 percent while adjustment plus seasonal \\r\\n    borrowing averaged somewhat more than anticipated.\\nMost market interest rates declined slightly during the \\r\\n    intermeeting period, and major indexes of stock prices posted new \\r\\n    highs. Market participants saw the incoming news on inflation as \\r\\n    encouraging; still, they viewed the economy as relatively robust, and \\r\\n    on balance they deemed a firming of monetary policy to counteract a \\r\\n    potential buildup of inflation pressures as likely in the next few \\r\\n    months, but probably not in the very near term.\\nIn foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the \\r\\n    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies changed little on balance \\r\\n    over the intermeeting period. The dollar fell against the yen in the \\r\\n    context of somewhat higher Japanese interest rates and renewed \\r\\n    expressions of U.S. concern about bilateral trade issues. The dollar \\r\\n    appreciated slightly relative to the German mark and other European \\r\\n    currencies against the background of relatively strong U.S. economic \\r\\n    data and generally sluggish economic activity in continental Europe.\\nGrowth of the broad monetary aggregates, though a little \\r\\n    faster than in most of 1993, remained relatively slow over December \\r\\n    and January. Investors evidently continued to find low-yielding \\r\\n    deposits less appealing than stock and bond mutual funds, although \\r\\n    recent inflows to bond funds appeared to have been at a slower rate \\r\\n    than that seen over most of 1993. For the year 1993, growth of both \\r\\n    M2 and M3 was estimated to have been slightly above the lower ends of \\r\\n    the Committee\\'s ranges. Private borrowing had picked up in recent \\r\\n    months, and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a somewhat \\r\\n    faster, though still moderate, pace in the fourth quarter; for the \\r\\n    year, nonfinancial debt was estimated to have been in the lower half \\r\\n    of the Committee\\'s monitoring range.\\nThe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that \\r\\n    economic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth \\r\\n    quarter, but that the economy still would advance in 1994 at a rate \\r\\n    somewhat in excess of the growth of potential. The severe winter \\r\\n    weather over much of the country and the California earthquake would \\r\\n    tend to distort economic indicators for the early part of the year: \\r\\n    however, taken together, these developments were not expected to have \\r\\n    a material or lasting effect on the overall level of activity or \\r\\n    prices. Consumer spending, which for some time had tended to outpace \\r\\n    the growth of disposable income, was projected to increase at a rate \\r\\n    more in line with incomes. Business fixed investment was expected to \\r\\n    decelerate gradually from the very rapid rate of 1993, reflecting the \\r\\n    diminishing effect of the earlier pickup in output growth, the slower \\r\\n    growth of corporate cash flow, and a less rapid decline in the cost of \\r\\n    capital. Homebuilding activity, driven by the greatly improved \\r\\n    affordability of housing and increased confidence in employment \\r\\n    prospects, was anticipated to continue at a relatively brisk pace \\r\\n    through much of the year. Exports were projected to strengthen \\r\\n    somewhat, bolstered by some pickup in foreign economic growth, and \\r\\n    fiscal restraint was expected to exert a reduced drag on spending. In \\r\\n    light of the limited margins of slack in labor and product markets \\r\\n    that were anticipated to prevail over the forecast horizon, the \\r\\n    ongoing expansion was projected to be associated with only a slight \\r\\n    further reduction in the core rate of inflation.\\nIn the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective \\r\\n    economic developments, members commented that the economy had entered \\r\\n    the new year with appreciable forward momentum and that the expansion \\r\\n    was likely to be sustained over the year ahead at a pace somewhat \\r\\n    above the economy\\'s long-run potential. The very rapid rate of \\r\\n    economic growth now indicated for the fourth quarter of 1993 clearly \\r\\n    could not be maintained. Much of the recent impetus to the expansion \\r\\n    stemmed from a surge in expenditures on housing, business equipment, \\r\\n    and consumer durables. Such spending had reached a very high level in \\r\\n    relation to underlying demands so that the pace of additional \\r\\n    increases undoubtedly would moderate during the course of 1994. \\r\\n    Still, the economic expansion seemed to have considerable momentum, \\r\\n    largely as a consequence of diminishing balance sheet constraints and \\r\\n    generally favorable financial conditions spurred by a highly \\r\\n    accommodative monetary policy. As a consequence, a number of members \\r\\n    expressed the view that the risks were on the upside of a moderate \\r\\n    growth forecast. In the context of low and decreasing slack in the \\r\\n    economy, little further progress would be made toward price stability \\r\\n    in 1994, and there was a distinct risk of higher inflation at some \\r\\n    point if monetary policy were not adjusted. While broad measures of \\r\\n    inflation did not on the whole suggest any changes in inflation \\r\\n    trends, some members noted that a number of commodity prices had \\r\\n    turned up in recent months, and they referred to still scattered but \\r\\n    increasing anecdotal reports that some business firms were paying \\r\\n    slightly higher prices for various materials purchased for use in the \\r\\n    production process.\\nIn keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee \\r\\n    establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt \\r\\n    aggregates, the Committee members and the Federal Reserve Bank \\r\\n    presidents not currently serving as members had prepared projections \\r\\n    of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for \\r\\n    1994. The central tendency of the forecasts pointed to somewhat \\r\\n    faster economic growth this year than currently was estimated for \\r\\n    1993. The anticipated rate of economic expansion was expected to \\r\\n    foster a limited further drop in the rate of unemployment by the \\r\\n    fourth quarter of this year. With the slack in productive resources \\r\\n    expected to diminish further to a quite low level, price and cost \\r\\n    pressures were unlikely to abate significantly: indeed, price \\r\\n    increases in 1994 could exceed those of 1993 when inflation had been \\r\\n    held down by favorable developments in energy prices. Measured from \\r\\n    the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994, the \\r\\n    forecasts for growth of real GDP had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/4 \\r\\n    percent and a full range of 2-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent. Projections of \\r\\n    the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1994 were \\r\\n    all in a range of 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent calculated on the basis of \\r\\n    the new survey recently introduced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \\r\\n    For the CPI, the central tendency of the forecasts for the period from \\r\\n    the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994 was centered \\r\\n    on increases of about 3 percent within a range of 2-1/4 to 4 percent, \\r\\n    and for nominal GDP the forecasts were clustered in a range of 5-1/2 \\r\\n    to 6 percent for the year.\\nIn the Committee\\'s review of factors underlying recent \\r\\n    developments, members observed that generally favorable financial \\r\\n    conditions provided a backdrop conducive to further robust expansion \\r\\n    in business activity. Much of the recent strengthening in economic \\r\\n    growth was generated by increased spending in interest-sensitive \\r\\n    sectors of the economy such as housing in response to relatively low \\r\\n    interest rates. Generally buoyant equity markets, a readier \\r\\n    availability of financing from lending institutions, and the \\r\\n    strengthened financial condition of businesses and households also \\r\\n    were cited as factors tending to boost economic activity. Balance \\r\\n    sheet restructuring activities appeared to have slackened markedly, \\r\\n    and while balance sheet adjustments probably were still being made, \\r\\n    the latter seemed to be exerting much less restraint on the \\r\\n    willingness of businesses and especially households to spend and to \\r\\n    incur new debt to finance growing expenditures.\\nIn their reports on developments across the nation, members \\r\\n    commented on widespread indications of improving economic activity, \\r\\n    including some strengthening in regions that earlier were \\r\\n    characterized by stagnant business conditions. Some areas continued \\r\\n    to be affected adversely by special factors, especially by spending \\r\\n    cutbacks in defense and aerospace industries. California was a \\r\\n    notable example, but a range of indicators suggested that the \\r\\n    California economy might be stabilizing, albeit at a depressed level. \\r\\n    after an extended period of declining activity. Mirroring these \\r\\n    developments, business sentiment was characterized as generally \\r\\n    optimistic around the nation. While business executives remained \\r\\n    cautious in their hiring practices, the expansion in business activity \\r\\n    was fostering sizable overall gains in employment even in areas where \\r\\n    some major business concerns were reducing their workforces. A few \\r\\n    large firms that previously had frozen or reduced their payrolls were \\r\\n    now reported to be hiring additional workers.\\nTurning to prospective developments in key sectors of the \\r\\n    economy, the members anticipated that the expansion in consumer \\r\\n    expenditures would be well maintained during 1994, though the growth \\r\\n    in such spending probably would moderate to a pace more in line with \\r\\n    gains in disposable income. The available data on retail sales since \\r\\n    the holiday period were still limited, but anecdotal reports pointed \\r\\n    to continuing momentum in several parts of the country. Winter storms \\r\\n    had hindered sales in a number of areas, but according to some retail \\r\\n    contacts the adverse effects were likely to be temporary. In any \\r\\n    event, the very rapid rates of growth in sales of automobiles and \\r\\n    other consumer durables were not sustainable, and already high \\r\\n    consumer debt ratios would be a further inhibiting factor. It was \\r\\n    noted in this connection that consumer debt had become more \\r\\n    concentrated over the course of recent years among consumer groups \\r\\n    that were most likely to borrow to help finance their spending, with \\r\\n    the result that the ability of such consumers to incur additional \\r\\n    indebtedness could be diminished. Higher taxes confronting some \\r\\n    households also were cited as a negative factor in the outlook for the \\r\\n    consumer sector. On balance, however, while the prospects for \\r\\n    consumer spending clearly were not free of uncertainty, the marked \\r\\n    improvement in consumer confidence and favorable financial conditions \\r\\n    would provide a setting conducive to sustained moderate growth in \\r\\n    consumer expenditures.\\nThe improvement in consumer sentiment together with the \\r\\n    availability of relatively low cost financing had fostered very strong \\r\\n    growth in housing construction over the closing months of 1993 and, \\r\\n    adjusting for seasonal weather conditions, anecdotal reports from many \\r\\n    areas suggested a continued robust performance in this sector of the \\r\\n    economy in the early weeks of this year. The strength in housing \\r\\n    activity had induced increases in the costs of lumber and other \\r\\n    building materials, and shortages of skilled construction workers were \\r\\n    reported in some areas. Despite these developments, prices of new \\r\\n    homes did not appear at this point to be under significant upward \\r\\n    pressure. Looking ahead, with housing construction already at high \\r\\n    levels, further gains over the course of 1994 were expected to be \\r\\n    substantially below those recorded in recent quarters.\\nBusiness fixed investment was likely to be sustained by \\r\\n    continuing efforts to modernize production facilities in order to \\r\\n    achieve more efficient operations in highly competitive domestic and \\r\\n    world markets. The gains in such investment had been concentrated in \\r\\n    expenditures for equipment, and while new orders pointed to further \\r\\n    brisk growth in the months ahead, increases in such expenditures were \\r\\n    likely to moderate over time. At the same time, growing economic \\r\\n    activity and associated declines in commercial and industrial vacancy \\r\\n    rates, at least in some parts of the country, suggested that nonresidential building construction other than office structures would post \\r\\n    sizable increases over the year. Rebuilding activity following the \\r\\n    earthquake in California would stimulate engineering and construction \\r\\n    in the Los Angeles area over the quarters ahead.\\nFiscal policy and foreign trade had exerted retarding effects \\r\\n    on the economy in 1993. While the response of the economy to fiscal \\r\\n    restraint and the outlook for export markets remained subject to \\r\\n    substantial uncertainty, both fiscal policy and the trade deficit were \\r\\n    expected at this point to be less negative factors in the performance \\r\\n    of the economy during 1994. With regard to the outlook for fiscal \\r\\n    policy, the downtrend in defense spending was projected to moderate \\r\\n    and to contribute to a smaller net decline in overall federal \\r\\n    government expenditures on goods and services in 1994. It was noted \\r\\n    that the widespread political support of efforts to curtail federal \\r\\n    government deficits could be expected to continue to contain new \\r\\n    federal spending initiatives. With regard to the outlook for U.S. \\r\\n    exports, more accommodative fiscal or monetary policies abroad were \\r\\n    expected to foster a gradual improvement in rates of economic growth \\r\\n    in major foreign industrial countries with beneficial effects on the \\r\\n    demand from those countries for U.S. goods and services. One member \\r\\n    also commented that NAFTA already seemed to be having a favorable \\r\\n    effect on some exports to Mexico.\\nOne sector of the economy that was viewed as a source of \\r\\n    particular uncertainty was the outlook for inventories. Business \\r\\n    firms continued to maintain tight control over their inventories, and \\r\\n    in general the latter were at quite low levels in relation to sales. \\r\\n    Indeed, there were some anecdotal reports that inventory shortfalls \\r\\n    had resulted in the loss of sales in recent months. Lean inventory \\r\\n    levels in the context of diminishing slack in labor and product \\r\\n    markets raised concerns about the potential for increasing capacity \\r\\n    pressures should strong demands persist that would tend to deplete \\r\\n    existing inventories and lead to efforts not only to rebuild but to \\r\\n    increase them. Thus far, there were few signs of developments such as \\r\\n    significant increases in delivery lead times or in the costs of goods \\r\\n    purchased by business firms that in the past had triggered substantial \\r\\n    inventory buildups. However, there were ample precedents in the \\r\\n    history of business cycle expansions of efforts to accumulate large \\r\\n    inventories in periods when strong final demands already were exerting \\r\\n    inflationary pressures in the economy.\\nThe members generally expressed concern about a buildup in \\r\\n    inflationary pressures during the year ahead, especially if what they \\r\\n    currently viewed as a very accommodative monetary policy were \\r\\n    maintained. A number of members emphasized that even with the \\r\\n    substantial slowing that they anticipated in the rate of economic \\r\\n    expansion from the very rapid growth in the fourth quarter, overall \\r\\n    margins of slack in labor and product markets, already reduced to \\r\\n    fairly modest levels, would shrink further in the quarters ahead with \\r\\n    the clear possibility that various imbalances and added inflation \\r\\n    would emerge in the absence of monetary tightening actions. \\r\\n    Continuing upward impetus to food prices, resulting from the adverse \\r\\n    weather conditions during 1993, and the likelihood that energy prices \\r\\n    would not decline further and might in fact turn up in an environment \\r\\n    of somewhat stronger worldwide demand for energy products could add to \\r\\n    overall price pressures.\\nThe members acknowledged that broad measures of prices and \\r\\n    wages had displayed mixed patterns over recent months and that on the \\r\\n    whole they did not yet point to any clear change in inflation trends. \\r\\n    However, some other indicators were more disquieting. One example was \\r\\n    the growing, though still limited, number of anecdotal reports of \\r\\n    shortages of skilled workers in some parts of the country or \\r\\n    occupations, notably construction. Moreover, there were more reports \\r\\n    of rising prices for products being purchased by business firms for \\r\\n    use in the production process and in turn of successful efforts by \\r\\n    businesses to raise their own prices in order to pass on higher costs \\r\\n    or to improve their profit margins. More generally, many commodity \\r\\n    prices had increased over the past several weeks. On the positive \\r\\n    side, competitive pressures remained intense in many markets, \\r\\n    augmented in markets for numerous products by competition from foreign \\r\\n    producers. Some members also commented that the tradeoff between \\r\\n    economic growth and inflation would be improved over the year ahead to \\r\\n    the extent that the credibility of the System\\'s anti-inflationary \\r\\n    policy was maintained.\\nIn keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and \\r\\n    Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee \\r\\n    at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and \\r\\n    debt aggregates in 1994 that it had established on a tentative basis \\r\\n    at its meeting on July 6-7, 1993. The tentative ranges included \\r\\n    expansion of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3, \\r\\n    measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of \\r\\n    1994. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial \\r\\n    debt had been set provisionally at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. All of \\r\\n    these ranges were unchanged from those that the Committee had set for \\r\\n    1993: the latter had been adjusted down to take account of ongoing \\r\\n    increases in velocity.\\nIn the Committee\\'s discussion of the ranges for 1994, which \\r\\n    tended to focus on M2, all the members expressed a preference for \\r\\n    affirming the M2 and M3 ranges that had been established on a provisional basis in July and all but one favored adopting the provisional \\r\\n    monitoring range for nonfinancial debt, that member preferred a lower \\r\\n    range. Many of the members commented on the uncertainties that \\r\\n    surrounded the establishment of ranges that were consistent with the \\r\\n    Committee\\'s goals for the economy. They noted that a variety of \\r\\n    developments had altered the historical relationships between the \\r\\n    monetary aggregates and broad measures of economic performance over \\r\\n    the past several years. The resulting uncertainty implied that the \\r\\n    Committee needed to retain a flexible approach to the behavior of the \\r\\n    monetary aggregates in relation to their ranges, including the need to \\r\\n    assess a broad array of other indicators to gauge the implications of \\r\\n    monetary growth developments. Nonetheless, the members concluded that \\r\\n    as best they could evaluate evolving financial conditions at this \\r\\n    point, monetary growth within the tentative ranges would be likely to \\r\\n    promote the Committee\\'s objectives of sustained economic expansion and \\r\\n    subdued inflation.\\nIn 1993, both M2 and M3 had grown at rates about 1/2 percentage point above the lower bounds of the ranges that the Committee now \\r\\n    contemplated retaining for 1994. According to a staff analysis \\r\\n    prepared for this meeting, somewhat faster growth in both of these \\r\\n    aggregates could be expected in 1994. But with nominal GDP also \\r\\n    expected to be stronger, as indicated by the central tendency of the \\r\\n    members\\' forecasts, the velocity of M2 would continue to rise at an \\r\\n    appreciably faster rate than historical relationships would have \\r\\n    suggested. This assessment assumed that households would continue to \\r\\n    redirect savings from M2-type accounts to higher-yielding investments, \\r\\n    especially bond and stock mutual funds. However, such redeployments \\r\\n    of funds should moderate this year to the extent that some investors \\r\\n    already had accomplished a considerable portion of their desired \\r\\n    portfolio reallocations and in light of the possibility that changes \\r\\n    in the prices of stocks and bonds, including the drop in bond prices \\r\\n    in recent months, would underline the risks of holding such \\r\\n    instruments. Moreover, depository institutions had strengthened their \\r\\n    capital positions markedly and were likely to compete more aggressively \\r\\n    for M2 and especially for M3-type deposits in an effort to maintain or \\r\\n    increase their role in the financing of expanding economic activity. \\r\\n    While these developments and their implications for monetary growth \\r\\n    could not be forecast with confidence, the members believed that the \\r\\n    ranges under consideration would probably be sufficiently wide to \\r\\n    accommodate M2 and M3 growth rates under a variety of likely velocity \\r\\n    scenarios. For example, if the factors that had tended to depress the \\r\\n    growth of the broad aggregates in relation to income did not abate as \\r\\n    expected this year, M2 and M3 growth would again be near the lower \\r\\n    bounds of the Committee\\'s ranges. Alternatively, if the behavior of \\r\\n    these aggregates were to move closer to earlier patterns, growth in \\r\\n    the upper portions of the ranges would foster an economic performance \\r\\n    in line with the members\\' forecasts.\\nFrom the perspective of a longer time horizon, many of the \\r\\n    members noted that the provisional range for M2 was essentially at a \\r\\n    level that could well prove to be consistent with sustained and \\r\\n    noninflationary economic expansion. This conclusion assumed that \\r\\n    historical relationships between money growth and the expansion of \\r\\n    broad measures of economic performance would be restored at some \\r\\n    point. In the absence of such a development or the emergence of new, \\r\\n    reasonably stable relationships, the Committee would have to continue \\r\\n    to place diminished reliance on the monetary aggregates in the \\r\\n    formulation of monetary policy.\\nWith regard to the range for nonfinancial debt, the members \\r\\n    anticipated that its growth this year would remain within the contemplated range. A staff analysis suggested that its federal borrowing \\r\\n    component would decrease as a result of the ongoing effects of deficit \\r\\n    reduction measures that had been enacted and the rise in tax receipts \\r\\n    stemming from economic growth. At the same time, borrowing by the \\r\\n    nonfederal sectors should strengthen further against the backdrop of \\r\\n    more comfortable financial positions and the expected pickup in GDP \\r\\n    expansion. In one view, however, a somewhat lower range was desirable \\r\\n    for nonfinancial debt. In light of the shift in business preferences \\r\\n    away from debt and toward equity, debt velocity could increase and \\r\\n    slower growth in debt would be consistent with the Committee\\'s \\r\\n    objectives. However, this member could accept the higher range \\r\\n    favored by the other members for 1994.\\nAt the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all the \\r\\n    members indicated that they favored or could accept the ranges for \\r\\n    1994 that the Committee had established on a tentative basis at its \\r\\n    meeting in July 1993. In keeping with the Committee\\'s usual \\r\\n    procedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the ranges would be \\r\\n    reviewed at midyear, or sooner if deemed necessary, in light of the \\r\\n    behavior of the aggregates and interim economic and financial \\r\\n    developments. The Committee approved the following paragraph for \\r\\n    inclusion in the domestic policy directive:\\n\\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary \\r\\n      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In \\r\\n      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this \\r\\n      meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of \\r\\n      1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, \\r\\n      measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth \\r\\n      quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that \\r\\n      developments contributing to unusual velocity increases \\r\\n      could persist during the year and that money growth \\r\\n      within these ranges would be consistent with its broad \\r\\n      policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of \\r\\n      total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8 \\r\\n      percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary \\r\\n      aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light \\r\\n      of progress toward price level stability, movements in \\r\\n      their velocities, and developments in the economy and \\r\\n      financial markets.\\nVotes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan \\r\\n      McDonough, Broaddus, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley, \\r\\n      LaWare, Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.\\nVotes against this action: None.\\nAbsent and not voting: Messrs. Angell and \\r\\n      Mullins.\\n\\nIn the Committee\\'s discussion of policy for the intermeeting \\r\\n    period ahead, the members favored an adjustment toward a less \\r\\n    accommodative policy stance, though views differed to some extent with \\r\\n    regard to the amount of the adjustment. The current policy posture, \\r\\n    which had been in effect since the late summer of 1992, was highly \\r\\n    stimulative as evidenced, for example, by very low or even slightly \\r\\n    negative real short-term interest rates and, in the view of at least \\r\\n    some members, the relatively rapid growth over an extended period in \\r\\n    narrow measures of money and reserves. Such a policy had been \\r\\n    appropriate in a period when various developments had tended to \\r\\n    inhibit the expansion, including widespread efforts to repair strained \\r\\n    balance sheets and a variety of business restructuring activities that \\r\\n    had tended to depress confidence and spending. More recently, the \\r\\n    considerable progress made by households and businesses in decreasing \\r\\n    their debt service burdens and the much strengthened capital positions \\r\\n    of lending institutions had provided a financial basis, in the context \\r\\n    of low interest rates, for growth in demands on productive capacity \\r\\n    that could generate inflation pressures. In this situation, the \\r\\n    members agreed that monetary policy should be adjusted toward a more \\r\\n    neutral stance that would encourage sustained economic growth without \\r\\n    a buildup of inflationary imbalances. The members recognized that \\r\\n    timely action was needed to preclude the necessity for more vigorous \\r\\n    and disruptive policy moves later if inflationary pressures were \\r\\n    allowed to intensify. The history of past cyclical upswings had \\r\\n    demonstrated the inflationary consequences and adverse effects on \\r\\n    economic activity of delayed anti-inflation policy actions.\\nIn the course of the Committee\\'s discussion, a number of \\r\\n    members endorsed a policy move that would involve only a slight \\r\\n    adjustment toward a less accommodative degree of reserve pressure. \\r\\n    These members recognized that evolving economic conditions might well \\r\\n    justify a somewhat greater policy adjustment. They believed, however, \\r\\n    that even a slight move at this time was likely to have a particularly \\r\\n    strong impact on financial markets because it would be the first \\r\\n    policy change after a long hiatus and indeed the first tightening \\r\\n    action in about five years. The market effect might be amplified by a \\r\\n    contemplated decision to authorize the Chairman to announce the policy \\r\\n    action (discussed below). In the circumstances, these members felt \\r\\n    that a somewhat greater policy adjustment would incur an unacceptable \\r\\n    risk of dislocative repercussions in financial markets. A relatively \\r\\n    small move would readily accomplish the purposes of signaling the \\r\\n    Committee\\'s anti-inflation resolve and together with expected further \\r\\n    action should help to temper or avert an increase in inflation \\r\\n    expectations and speculative developments in financial markets.\\nOther members indicated a preference for a somewhat greater \\r\\n    firming action that would move monetary policy closer to a desirable \\r\\n    neutral stance. In this view, recent developments in the economy had \\r\\n    demonstrated that monetary policy was much too accommodative and that \\r\\n    slow, gradual tightening moves risked allowing inflation pressures to \\r\\n    build. A more decisive policy move at this juncture would in fact \\r\\n    reduce uncertainty, because fewer discrete actions would be required \\r\\n    and they would have a more pronounced and desirable effect in curbing \\r\\n    inflationary sentiment and thus in minimizing upward pressures on \\r\\n    longer-term interest rates over time. The result would be a policy \\r\\n    stance that was more consistent with sustained economic expansion and \\r\\n    progress toward price stability.\\nIn further discussion, all the members indicated that they \\r\\n    could accept the proposed slight policy adjustment at this point, but \\r\\n    many observed that additional firming probably would be desirable \\r\\n    later. The members did not see any unusual likelihood that a further \\r\\n    policy action would be needed during the intermeeting period, and the \\r\\n    Committee therefore decided to retain an unbiased intermeeting \\r\\n    instruction in the directive. In this connection, it was understood \\r\\n    that the Committee would be prepared to review its policy stance and \\r\\n    take further action, if warranted by intermeeting developments, at a \\r\\n    telephone conference during the period ahead.\\nAt this meeting, Committee members discussed and agreed on a \\r\\n    proposal to have the Chairman announce the Committee\\'s short-term \\r\\n    policy decision promptly. The purpose of such an announcement, which \\r\\n    would be a departure from past Committee practice, was to avoid any \\r\\n    misinterpretation of the Committee\\'s action and its purpose. Because \\r\\n    this would be the first tightening policy action in a long time, it \\r\\n    was likely to attract considerable attention. The Committee did not \\r\\n    intend this announcement to set any precedents or to imply any \\r\\n    commitments regarding the announcement of its decisions in the future. \\r\\n    That matter would be reviewed along with other issues relating to the \\r\\n    disclosure of Committee information at a later meeting.\\nAt the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all the \\r\\n    members indicated that they could support a directive that called for \\r\\n    a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and \\r\\n    that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any \\r\\n    adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the \\r\\n    Committee decided that in the context of its long-run objectives for \\r\\n    price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful \\r\\n    consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, \\r\\n    slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be \\r\\n    acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions \\r\\n    contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with \\r\\n    moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the first half of 1994.\\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of \\r\\n    New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by \\r\\n    the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in \\r\\n    accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\\n\\nThe information reviewed at this meeting indicates \\r\\n      a strong advance in economic activity during the \\r\\n      closing months of 1993, and the limited data available \\r\\n      for the early weeks of this year suggest appreciable \\r\\n      further gains. The January labor market data were \\r\\n      complicated by statistical revisions and weather-related reporting problems; however, a variety of \\r\\n      indicators pointed convincingly to a continuing \\r\\n      expansion of employment. Industrial production \\r\\n      increased sharply in the fourth quarter and appears to \\r\\n      have risen considerably further in January. Consumer \\r\\n      spending and housing activity posted solid gains in \\r\\n      late 1993, and strong sales of motor vehicles in \\r\\n      January suggested continued buoyancy in consumer \\r\\n      demand. Trends in contracts and orders point to \\r\\n      further sizable gains in business fixed investment. \\r\\n      The average nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in \\r\\n      October-November was about the same as its average rate \\r\\n      in the third quarter. Over the latter part of 1993, \\r\\n      increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer \\r\\n      prices, excluding their food and energy components, were somewhat larger than earlier in the year and \\r\\n      prices of a number of commodities also turned up \\r\\n      recently.\\nMost market interest rates have declined slightly \\r\\n      since the Committee meeting on December 21. 1993. In \\r\\n      foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of \\r\\n      the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies is \\r\\n      about unchanged over the intermeeting period.\\nGrowth of M2 and M3 was relatively slow over \\r\\n      December and January. From the fourth quarter of 1992 \\r\\n      to the fourth quarter of 1993, M2 and M3 are estimated \\r\\n      to have grown at rates slightly above the lower ends of \\r\\n      the Committee\\'s ranges for the year. Private borrowing \\r\\n      has picked up in recent months and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a moderate rate in the \\r\\n      fourth quarter; for the year, nonfinancial debt is \\r\\n      estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half \\r\\n      of the Committee\\'s monitoring range.\\nThe Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary \\r\\n      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In \\r\\n      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this \\r\\n      meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of \\r\\n      1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, \\r\\n      measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth \\r\\n      quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that \\r\\n      developments contributing to unusual velocity increases \\r\\n      could persist during the year and that money growth \\r\\n      within these ranges would be consistent with its broad \\r\\n      policy objectives.

In \\r\\n      the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for \\r\\n      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and \\r\\n      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, \\r\\n      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve \\r\\n      restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be \\r\\n      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The \\r\\n      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be \\r\\n      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the \\r\\n      first half of 1994.\\nVotes for this action: Messrs.

       "'       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity and employment have continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months, apart from weather-related disruptions. Although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, and the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed. Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committeeâ\\x80\\x99s longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.           Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.           To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month. The Committee also will purchase longer-term Treasury securities after its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of Treasury securities is completed at the end of the year, initially at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and, in January, will resume rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.           The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.           To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committeeâ\\x80\\x99s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. The Committee views these thresholds as consistent with its earlier date-based guidance. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.           Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Dennis P. Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Jerome H. Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; John C. Williams; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who opposed the asset purchase program and the characterization of the conditions under which an exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate.

       "        Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity and employment have continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months, apart from weather-related disruptions. Although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, and the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed. Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committeeâs longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\n",
       "     </p>, '\\n', <p>\n",
       "        Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.\n",
       "     </p>, '\\n', <p>\n",
       "        To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month. The Committee also will purchase longer-term Treasury securities after its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of Treasury securities is completed at the end of the year, initially at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and, in January, will resume rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.\n",
       "     </p>, '\\n', <p>\n",
       "        The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.\n",
       "     </p>, '\\n', <p>\n",
       "        To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committeeâs 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. The Committee views these thresholds as consistent with its earlier date-based guidance. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.\n",

Lacker, who opposed the asset purchase program and the characterization of the conditions under which an exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate.\n",
